20188.0	('N-acetyl-l-methionine', 'N-acetylmethionine', 'Acetyl-l-methionine', 'Ac-met-oh', 'Methionamine')	mouse	 Two experiments were conducted to investigate the production effects of N-acetyl-l-methionine (NALM; experiment 1) and to estimate its bioavailability (BA) and rumen escape (RE; experiment 2), respectively, in lactating dairy cows. In experiment 1, 18 multiparous Holstein cows were used in a replicated, 3 × 3 Latin square design experiment with three 28-d periods. Treatments were (1) basal diet estimated to supply 45 g/d digestible Met (dMet) or 1.47% of metabolizable protein (MP; control), (2) basal diet top-dressed with 32 g/d of NALM to achieve dMet supply of 2.2% of MP, and (3) basal diet top-dressed with 56 g/d of NALM to achieve dMet supply of 2.6% of MP. The NALM treatments supplied estimated 17 and 29 g/d dMet from NALM, respectively, based on manufacturer's specifications. In experiment 2, 4 rumen-cannulated lactating Holstein cows were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design experiment with four 12-d periods. A 12-d period for baseline data collection and 4 d for determination of RE of NALM preceded the Latin square experiment. For determination of RE, 30 g of NALM were dosed into the rumen simultaneously with Cr-EDTA (used as a rumen fluid kinetics marker) and samples of ruminal contents were collected at 0 (before dosing), 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 18, and 24 h after dosing. Rumen escape of NALM was calculated using the estimated passage rate based on the measured Cr rate of disappearance. Bioavailability of abomasally dosed NALM was determined using the area under the curve of plasma Met concentration technique. Two doses of l-Met (providing 7.5 and 15 g of dMet) and 2 doses of NALM (11.2 and 14.4 g of dMet) were separately pulse-dosed into the abomasum of the cows and blood was collected from the jugular vein for Met concentration analysis at 0 (before dosing), 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, and 24 h after dosing. Supplementation of NALM did not affect DMI, milk yield, feed efficiency, or milk protein and lactose concentrations and yields in experiment 1. Milk fat concentration and energy-corrected milk yield decreased linearly with NALM dose. Plasma Met concentration was not affected by NALM dose. The estimated relative BA of abomasally dosed NALM (experiment 2) was 50% when dosed at 14.4 g/cow (11.2 g/d dMet from NALM) and 24% when dosed at 28.8 g/cow (14.4 g/d dMet from NALM). The estimated RE of NALM was 19% based on the measured k Neutral amino acids can be delivered into cells through the l-type amino acid transporter-1 (LAT1), which is a sodium independent transporter. The LAT1 protein is expressed in different tissues, including kidney, blood brain barrier and intestinal wall hence LAT1 can be used as a target in diseases associated with its overexpression. In-silico interactions between different ligands, including methionine (Met), N-acetyl-l-methionine (AcMet), hyaluronic acid (HA), grafted hyaluronic-acid l-methionine (HA-ADH-Met) and a novel grafted hyaluronic acid-N-acetyl-l-methionine (HA-ADH-AcMet), which are at the active site of the LAT1 transporter, were studied and the binding energies calculated. The HA-ADH-AcMet complex demonstrated binding energy and solvation energy of -74.84 and 81.46 kcal/mol, respectively, thus validating its potential to be synthesized. The structural conformation of the HA-ADH-AcMet was confirmed using  Methionine plays a vital role in protein synthesis, and regulation of antioxidant response in ruminants. This study aimed to assess the effects of dietary supplementation with N-acetyl-l-methionine (NALM), which serves a source of rumen-protected methionine, on growth performance, carcass traits, meat quality, and oxidative stability. Sixty Angus heifers (initial body weight = 408 ± 51.2 kg, 15-18 months) were stratified by body weight and randomly assigned to four dietary treatments: a control group (0% NALM), and experimental groups receiving diets containing 0.125%, 0.25%, and 0.50% NALM (dry matter (DM) basis), respectively. The experiment included a 2-week adaptation and a 22-week data and sample collection period. Results indicated that blood urea nitrogen in the plasma of the 0.25% NALM group was lower compared to the control and the 0.50% NALM groups (P = 0.02). The plasma methionine (P = 0.04), proline (P < 0.01), and tryptophan (P = 0.05) were higher in the 0.25% and 0.50% NALM groups, as well as the methionine and proline in the muscle of the 0.25% NALM group (P < 0.01). The muscle pH (P < 0.01) was increased by supplementing 0.25% and 0.50% NALM in diets but decreased the lactate (P < 0.01). The 0.25% NALM group also increased a* (P = 0.05), decreased L* (P = 0.05), drip loss (P = 0.01), and glycolytic potential in the muscle (P < 0.01). The total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and glutathione in muscle of 0.25% NALM group were higher than that of the control (P < 0.01), and the malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl were lower (P < 0.01). In conclusion, the dietary supplement with NALM improves meat quality by enhancing the antioxidant effect of lipids and proteins.

A lipase from Brucella thiophenivorans was prone to exhibit high activity and excellent enantioselectivity toward N-Ac-DL-MetOMe to produce the key chiral intermediate N-acetyl-L-methionine methyl ester (N-Ac-L-MetOMe). The results showed that the enzymatic reaction was carried out in 100 g/L racemic substrate for 2 h, the conversion reached 51.3%, the enantiomeric excess value N-Ac-L-MetOMe exceeded 99%, and the enantiomeric ratio value >200. Therefore, the lipase from B. thiophenivorans has potential prospects for the resolution of N-Ac-DL-MetOMe to produce the important intermediate N-Ac-L-MetOMe. Bulk size single crystal of N-acetyl DL-methionine (C7H13NO3S) (1) was grown using a home-made crystal growth setup (MKN setup). The identity of the grown crystal was confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The modes of vibrations of the functional groups present were assigned using the infrared (IR) spectrum. UV-vis-NIR spectra showed that the crystals have excellent transparency in the visible and infrared regions. The thermal stability and decomposition of the sample was studied by using thermal analysis (TGA/DTA). Photoluminescence excitation studies showed that the emission occurred at 350 nm for the compound.	N-acetyl-dl-methionine	PUBMED	('INFO', [('INFO', -9.639096970204264e-05)])
38287.0	('Hexanoylglycine', 'Hexanoyl glycine', 'N-caproylglycine', 'N-hexanoylglycine', 'Caproylglycine')	mouse	 Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency, one of the most common inherited metabolic disorders, is often mistaken for the sudden infant death syndrome or Reye's syndrome. Diagnosing it has been difficult because of a lack of fast and reliable diagnostic methods. We developed a stable-isotope dilution method to measure urinary n-hexanoylglycine, 3-phenylpropionylglycine, and suberylglycine, and we retrospectively tested its accuracy in diagnosing MCAD deficiency. We measured the concentrations of these three acylglycines in 54 urine samples from 21 patients with confirmed MCAD deficiency during the acute and asymptomatic phases of the illness and compared the results with the concentrations in 98 samples from healthy controls and patient controls with various diseases. The levels of urinary hexanoylglycine and phenylpropionylglycine were significantly increased in all samples from the patients with MCAD deficiency, clearly distinguishing them from both groups of controls. Although urinary suberylglycine was increased in the patients, the range of values in the normal controls who were receiving formula containing medium-chain triglycerides was very wide, overlapping somewhat with the values in the patients with asymptomatic MCAD deficiency. These results indicate that the measurement of urinary hexanoylglycine and phenylpropionylglycine by our method is highly specific for the diagnosis of MCAD deficiency. The method is fast and can be applied to random urine specimens, without any pretreatment of patients.	Hexanoylglycine	PUBMED	('INFO', [('INFO', -0.12693703174591064)])
6294.0	('Adenosine', 'Adenocard', 'Adenoscan', 'Adenine riboside', 'Beta-d-adenosine')	mouse	"Adenosine (symbol A) is an organic compound that occurs widely in nature in the form of diverse derivatives. The molecule consists of an adenine attached to a ribose via a β-N9-glycosidic bond. Adenosine is one of the four nucleoside building blocks of RNA (and its derivative deoxyadenosine is a building block of DNA), which are essential for all life on Earth. Its derivatives include the energy carriers adenosine mono-, di-, and triphosphate, also known as AMP/ADP/ATP. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is pervasive in signal transduction. Adenosine is used as an intravenous medication for some cardiac arrhythmias. Adenosyl (abbreviated Ado or 5'-dAdo) is the chemical group formed by removal of the 5′-hydroxy (OH) group. It is found in adenosylcobalamin (an active form of vitamin B12) and as a radical in the radical SAM enzymes. == Medical uses == === Supraventricular tachycardia === In individuals with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), adenosine is a first line treatment used to help identify and convert the rhythm. Certain SVTs can be successfully terminated with adenosine. This includes any re-entrant arrhythmias that require the AV node for the re-entry, e.g., AV reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) and AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). In addition, atrial tachycardia can sometimes be terminated with adenosine. Fast rhythms of the heart that are confined to the atria (e.g., atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter) or ventricles (e.g., monomorphic ventricular tachycardia), and do not involve the AV node as part of the re-entrant circuit, are not typically converted by adenosine. However, the ventricular response rate is temporarily slowed with adenosine in such cases. Because of the effects of adenosine on AV node-dependent SVTs, adenosine is considered a class V antiarrhythmic agent. When adenosine is used to cardiovert an abnormal rhythm, it is normal for the heart to enter ventricular asystole for a few seconds. This can be disconcerting to a normally conscious patient, and is associated with angina-like sensations in the chest. === Nuclear stress test === Adenosine is used as an adjunct to thallium (TI 201) or technetium (Tc99m) myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (nuclear stress test) in patients unable to undergo adequate stress testing with exercise. === Dosage === When used to treat SVT, adenosine is administered intravenously as a rapid bolus (typically 0.10–0.15 mg/kg initially) over 1-2 seconds, followed by a rapid saline flush (often using a 2-way or 3-way stopcock). If the initial dose is ineffective, it may be repeated every 2 minutes with a slightly increased dose (0.05–0.1 mg/kg increments) every 2 minutes up to a maximum total dose of 0.3 mg/kg (not exceeding 12 mg). Due to adenosine's extremely short half-life (less than 10 seconds), it is often injected through a central venous line or a large proximal peripheral vein; administration into lower extremities, PICC lines, or smaller veins may lead to therapeutic failure due to rapid metabolism before reaching the heart. When given to dilate the arteries, such as in a ""stress test"", the dosage is typically 0.14 mg/kg/min, administered for 4 or 6 minutes, depending on the protocol. The recommended dose may be increased in patients on theophylline since methylxanthines prevent binding of adenosine at receptor sites. The dose is often decreased in patients on dipyridamole (Persantine) and diazepam (Valium) because adenosine potentiates the effects of these drugs. The recommended dose is also reduced by half in patients presenting congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, shock, hypoxia, and/or chronic liver disease or chronic kidney disease, and in elderly patients. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects associated with adenosine administration are primarily due to its activation of adenosine receptors on vascular tissue, resulting in vasodilation. Side effects of adenosine include skin flushing, lightheadedness, nausea, sweating, nervousness, numbness, and a sense of impending doom. These effects are typically very short-lived due to adenosine's rapid metabolism and short half-life. Less common, but more serious, cardiovascular effects can occur, such as cardiac arrhythmias (including premature atrial and ventricular contractions and atrioventricular (AV) block), hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and prolonged asystole. == Drug interactions == Dipyridamole potentiates the action of adenosine, requiring the use of lower doses. Methylxanthines (e.g. caffeine found in coffee, theophylline found in tea, or theobromine found in chocolate) have a purine structure and bind to some of the same receptors as adenosine. Methylxanthines act as competitive antagonists of adenosine and can blunt its pharmacological effects. Individuals taking large quantities of methylxanthines may require increased doses of adenosine. Caffeine acts by blocking binding of adenosine to the adenosine A1 receptor, which enhances release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Caffeine also increases cyclic AMP levels through nonselective inhibition of phosphodiesterase. ""Caffeine has a three-dimensional structure similar to that of adenosine,"" which allows it to bind and block its receptors. == Contraindications == Common contraindications for adenosine include Asthma, traditionally considered an absolute contraindication. This is being contested, and it is now considered a relative contraindication (however, selective adenosine antagonists are being investigated for use in treatment of asthma) == Pharmacological effects == Adenosine is an endogenous purine nucleoside that modulates many physiological processes. Cellular signaling by adenosine occurs through four known adenosine receptor subtypes (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3). Extracellular adenosine concentrations from normal cells are approximately 300 nM; however, in response to cellular damage (e.g., in inflammatory or ischemic tissue), these concentrations are quickly elevated (600–1,200 nM). Thus, in regard to stress or injury, the function of adenosine is primarily that of cytoprotection preventing tissue damage during instances of hypoxia, ischemia, and seizure activity. Activation of A2A receptors produces a constellation of responses that in general can be classified as anti-inflammatory. Enzymatic production of adenosine can be anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive. === Adenosine receptors === All adenosine receptor subtypes (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) are G-protein-coupled receptors. The four receptor subtypes are further classified based on their ability to either stimulate or inhibit adenylate cyclase activity. The A1 receptors couple to Gi/o and decrease cAMP levels, while the A2 adenosine receptors couple to Gs, which stimulates adenylate cyclase activity. In addition, A1 receptors couple to Go, which has been reported to mediate adenosine inhibition of Ca2+ conductance, whereas A2B and A3 receptors also couple to Gq and stimulate phospholipase activity. Researchers at Cornell University have recently shown adenosine receptors to be key in opening the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Mice dosed with adenosine have shown increased transport across the BBB of amyloid plaque antibodies and prodrugs associated with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, and cancers of the central nervous system. === Ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor === Adenosine is an endogenous agonist of the ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor. However, while it is able to increase appetite, unlike other agonists of this receptor, adenosine is unable to induce the secretion of growth hormone and increase its plasma levels. === Mechanism of action === When it is administered intravenously, adenosine causes transient heart block in the atrioventricular (AV) node. This is mediated via the A1 receptor, inhibiting adenylyl cyclase, reducing cAMP and so causing cell hyperpolarization by increasing K+ efflux via inward rectifier K+ channels, subsequently inhibiting Ca2+ current. It also causes endothelial-dependent relaxation of smooth muscle as is found inside the artery walls. This causes dilation of the ""normal"" segments of arteries, i.e. where the endothelium is not separated from the tunica media by atherosclerotic plaque. This feature allows physicians to use adenosine to test for blockages in the coronary arteries, by exaggerating the difference between the normal and abnormal segments. The administration of adenosine also reduces blood flow to coronary arteries past the occlusion. Other coronary arteries dilate when adenosine is administered while the segment past the occlusion is already maximally dilated, which is a process called coronary steal. This leads to less blood reaching the ischemic tissue, which in turn produces the characteristic chest pain. == Metabolism == Adenosine used as a second messenger can be the result of de novo purine biosynthesis via adenosine monophosphate (AMP), though it is possible other pathways exist. When adenosine enters the circulation, it is broken down by adenosine deaminase, which is present in red blood cells and the vessel wall. Dipyridamole, an inhibitor of adenosine nucleoside transporter, allows adenosine to accumulate in the blood stream. This causes an increase in coronary vasodilatation. Adenosine deaminase deficiency is a known cause of immunodeficiency. == Research == === Viruses === The adenosine analog NITD008 has been reported to directly inhibit the recombinant RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the dengue virus by terminating its RNA chain synthesis. This interaction suppresses peak viremia and rise in cytokines and prevents lethality in infected animals, raising the possibility of a new treatment for this flavivirus. The 7-deaza-adenosine analog has been shown to inhibit the replication of the hepatitis C virus. BCX4430 is protective against Ebola and Marburg viruses. Such adenosine analogs are potentially clinically useful since they can be taken orally. === Anti-inflammatory properties === Adenosine is believed to be an anti-inflammatory agent at the A2A receptor. Topical treatment of adenosine to foot wounds in diabetes mellitus has been shown in lab animals to drastically increase tissue repair and reconstruction. Topical administration of adenosine for use in wound-healing deficiencies and diabetes mellitus in humans is currently under clinical investigation. Methotrexate's anti-inflammatory effect may be due to its stimulation of adenosine release. === Central nervous system === In general, adenosine has an inhibitory effect in the central nervous system (CNS). Caffeine's stimulatory effects are credited primarily (although not entirely) to its capacity to block adenosine receptors, thereby reducing the inhibitory tonus of adenosine in the CNS. This reduction in adenosine activity leads to increased activity of the neurotransmitters dopamine and glutamate. Experimental evidence suggests that adenosine and adenosine agonists can activate Trk receptor phosphorylation through a mechanism that requires the adenosine A2A receptor. === Hair === Adenosine has been shown to promote thickening of hair on people with thinning hair. A 2013 study compared topical adenosine with minoxidil in male androgenetic alopecia, finding it was as potent as minoxidil (in overall treatment outcomes) but with higher satisfaction rate with patients due to “faster prevention of hair loss and appearance of the newly grown hairs” (further trials were called for to clarify the findings). === Sleep === Adenosine is a key factor in regulating the body's sleep-wake cycle. Adenosine levels rise during periods of wakefulness and lowers during sleep. Higher adenosine levels correlate with a stronger feeling of sleepiness, also known as sleep drive or sleep pressure. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which is considered one of the most effective treatments for insomnia, utilizes short-term sleep deprivation to raise and regulate adenosine levels in the body, for the intended promotion of consistent and sustained sleep in the long term. A principal component of cannabis delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) induces sleep in rats by increasing adenosine levels in the basal forebrain. These components also significantly increase slow-wave sleep during the sleep cycle, mediated by CB1 receptor activation. These findings identify a potential therapeutic use of cannabinoids to induce sleep in conditions where sleep may be severely attenuated. == Vasodilation == It also plays a role in regulation of blood flow to various organs through vasodilation. == See also == Adenosine receptor Adenosine reuptake inhibitor List of growth hormone secretagogues == References =="	Adenosine	WIKIPEDIA	('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('END', -0.4742265045642853), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -2.339278580620885e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' MED', -0.01105300523340702), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.029764730483293533), (' PERSONAL', -0.001523790997453034), (' CARE', 0.0)])
1720.0	('Histidine', 'H-his-oh', 'Glyoxaline-5-alanine', 'Anti-rheuma', 'Istidina')	mouse	"Histidine (symbol His or H) is an essential amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated –NH3+ form under biological conditions), a carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated –COO− form under biological conditions), and an imidazole side chain (which is partially protonated), classifying it as a positively charged amino acid at physiological pH. Initially thought essential only for infants, it has now been shown in longer-term studies to be essential for adults also. It is encoded by the codons CAU and CAC. Histidine was first isolated by Albrecht Kossel and Sven Gustaf Hedin in 1896. The name stems from its discovery in tissue, from ἱστός histós ""tissue"". It is also a precursor to histamine, a vital inflammatory agent in immune responses. The acyl radical is histidyl. == Properties of the imidazole side chain == The conjugate acid (protonated form) of the imidazole side chain in histidine has a pKa of approximately 6.0. Thus, below a pH of 6, the imidazole ring is mostly protonated (as described by the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation). The resulting imidazolium ring bears two NH bonds and has a positive charge. The positive charge is equally distributed between both nitrogens and can be represented with two equally important resonance structures. Sometimes, the symbol Hip is used for this protonated form instead of the usual His. Above pH 6, one of the two protons is lost. The remaining proton of the imidazole ring can reside on either nitrogen, giving rise to what are known as the N3-H or N1-H tautomers. The N3-H tautomer is shown in the figure above. In the N1-H tautomer, the NH is nearer the backbone. These neutral tautomers, also referred to as Nε (or Nτ) and Nδ (or Nπ), are sometimes referred to with symbols Hie and Hid, respectively. The imidazole/imidazolium ring of histidine is aromatic at all pH values. Under certain conditions, all three ion-forming groups of histidine can be charged forming the histidinium cation. The acid-base properties of the imidazole side chain are relevant to the catalytic mechanism of many enzymes. In catalytic triads, the basic nitrogen of histidine abstracts a proton from serine, threonine, or cysteine to activate it as a nucleophile. In a histidine proton shuttle, histidine is used to quickly shuttle protons. It can do this by abstracting a proton with its basic nitrogen to make a positively charged intermediate and then use another molecule, a buffer, to extract the proton from its acidic nitrogen. In carbonic anhydrases, a histidine proton shuttle is utilized to rapidly shuttle protons away from a zinc-bound water molecule to quickly regenerate the active form of the enzyme. In helices E and F of hemoglobin, histidine influences binding of dioxygen as well as carbon monoxide. This interaction enhances the affinity of Fe(II) for O2 but destabilizes the binding of CO, which binds only 200 times stronger in hemoglobin, compared to 20,000 times stronger in free heme. The tautomerism and acid-base properties of the imidazole side chain has been characterized by 15N NMR spectroscopy. The two 15N chemical shifts are similar (about 200 ppm, relative to nitric acid on the sigma scale, on which increased shielding corresponds to increased chemical shift). NMR spectral measurements shows that the chemical shift of N1-H drops slightly, whereas the chemical shift of N3-H drops considerably (about 190 vs. 145 ppm). This change indicates that the N1-H tautomer is preferred, possibly due to hydrogen bonding to the neighboring ammonium. The shielding at N3 is substantially reduced due to the second-order paramagnetic effect, which involves a symmetry-allowed interaction between the nitrogen lone pair and the excited π* states of the aromatic ring. At pH > 9, the chemical shifts of N1 and N3 are approximately 185 and 170 ppm. === Ligand === Histidine forms complexes with many metal ions. The imidazole sidechain of the histidine residue commonly serves as a ligand in metalloproteins. One example is the axial base attached to Fe in myoglobin and hemoglobin. Poly-histidine tags (of six or more consecutive H residues) are utilized for protein purification by binding to columns with nickel or cobalt, with micromolar affinity. Natural poly-histidine peptides, found in the venom of the viper Atheris squamigera have been shown to bind Zn(II), Ni(II) and Cu(II) and affect the function of venom metalloproteases. N-terminal histidines are known to function as bidentate ligands, with a metal (generally copper) bound to both the amine of the N-terminus and the Nε of the histidine; the Nδ is often methylated. Although recently discovered, this ""histidine brace"" motif is critical in biogeochemical cycles: it functions as the active site of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs), which break down unreactive polysaccharides such as cellulose. It is proposed that the evolution of these enzymes in fungi corresponds to the first widespread ability to decompose woody plant mass, leading to the end of the Carboniferous era and its mass accumulation of coal deposits. == Metabolism == === Biosynthesis === l-Histidine is an essential amino acid that is not synthesized de novo in humans. Humans and other animals must ingest histidine or histidine-containing proteins. The biosynthesis of histidine has been widely studied in prokaryotes such as E. coli. Histidine synthesis in E. coli involves eight gene products (His1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8) and it occurs in ten steps. This is possible because a single gene product has the ability to catalyze more than one reaction. For example, as shown in the pathway, His4 catalyzes 4 different steps in the pathway. Histidine is synthesized from phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP), which is made from ribose-5-phosphate by ribose-phosphate diphosphokinase in the pentose phosphate pathway. The first reaction of histidine biosynthesis is the condensation of PRPP and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by the enzyme ATP-phosphoribosyl transferase. ATP-phosphoribosyl transferase is indicated by His1 in the image. His4 gene product then hydrolyzes the product of the condensation, phosphoribosyl-ATP, producing phosphoribosyl-AMP (PRAMP), which is an irreversible step. His4 then catalyzes the formation of phosphoribosylformiminoAICAR-phosphate, which is then converted to phosphoribulosylformimino-AICAR-P by the His6 gene product. His7 splits phosphoribulosylformimino-AICAR-P to form d-erythro-imidazole-glycerol-phosphate. After, His3 forms imidazole acetol-phosphate releasing water. His5 then makes l-histidinol-phosphate, which is then hydrolyzed by His2 making histidinol. His4 catalyzes the oxidation of l-histidinol to form l-histidinal, an amino aldehyde. In the last step, l-histidinal is converted to l-histidine. The histidine biosynthesis pathway has been studied in the fungus Neurospora crassa, and a gene (His-3) encoding a multienzyme complex was found that was similar to the His4 gene of the bacterium E. coli. A genetic study of N. crassa histidine mutants indicated that the individual activities of the multienzyme complex occur in discrete, contiguous sections of the His-3 genetic map, suggesting that the different activities of the multienzyme complex are encoded separately from each other. However, mutants were also found that lacked all three activities simultaneously, suggesting that some mutations cause loss of function of the complex as a whole. Just like animals and microorganisms, plants need histidine for their growth and development. Microorganisms and plants are similar in that they can synthesize histidine. Both synthesize histidine from the biochemical intermediate phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate. In general, the histidine biosynthesis is very similar in plants and microorganisms. ==== Regulation of biosynthesis ==== This pathway requires energy in order to occur therefore, the presence of ATP activates the first enzyme of the pathway, ATP-phosphoribosyl transferase (shown as His1 in the image on the right). ATP-phosphoribosyl transferase is the rate determining enzyme, which is regulated through feedback inhibition meaning that it is inhibited in the presence of the product, histidine. === Degradation === Histidine is one of the amino acids that can be converted to intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle). Histidine, along with other amino acids such as proline and arginine, takes part in deamination, a process in which its amino group is removed. In prokaryotes, histidine is first converted to urocanate by histidase. Then, urocanase converts urocanate to 4-imidazolone-5-propionate. Imidazolonepropionase catalyzes the reaction to form formiminoglutamate (FIGLU) from 4-imidazolone-5-propionate. The formimino group is transferred to tetrahydrofolate, and the remaining five carbons form glutamate. Overall, these reactions result in the formation of glutamate and ammonia. Glutamate can then be deaminated by glutamate dehydrogenase or transaminated to form α-ketoglutarate. === Conversion to other biologically active amines === The histidine amino acid is a precursor for histamine, an amine produced in the body necessary for inflammation. The enzyme histidine ammonia-lyase converts histidine into ammonia and urocanic acid. A deficiency in this enzyme is present in the rare metabolic disorder histidinemia, producing urocanic aciduria as a key diagnostic finding. Histidine can be converted to 3-methylhistidine, which serves as a biomarker for skeletal muscle damage, by certain methyltransferase enzymes. Histidine is also a precursor for carnosine biosynthesis, which is a dipeptide found in skeletal muscle. In Actinomycetota and filamentous fungi, such as Neurospora crassa, histidine can be converted into the antioxidant ergothioneine. == Requirements == The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the U.S. Institute of Medicine set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for essential amino acids in 2002. For histidine, for adults 19 years and older, 14 mg/kg body weight/day. Supplemental histidine is being investigated for use in a variety of different conditions, including neurological disorders, atopic dermatitis, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, uraemic anaemia, ulcers, inflammatory bowel diseases, malignancies, and muscle performance during strenuous exercise. == See also == Carnosinemia Beta-Alanine Diphthamide Pauly reaction == References == == External links == Histidine MS Spectrum"	Histidine	WIKIPEDIA	('FOOD', [('FO', -0.002412992063909769), ('OD', 0.0)])

LAC (or placebo) was started intramuscularly at a dosage of 1000 mg/day for 10 days and continued orally at a dosage of 2000 mg/day for the remainder of the study (355 days). MAIN OUTCOME PARAMETERS AND RESULTS: The main efficacy parameter was the effect of treatment on 6- and 12-month changes from baseline in nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and amplitude in the sensory (ulnar, sural and median) and motor (median, ulnar and peroneal) nerves. The effect of treatment on pain was also evaluated by means of a visual analogue scale (VAS). Among the 294 patients with impaired electrophysiological parameters at baseline, those treated with LAC showed a statistically significant improvement in mean NCV and amplitude compared with placebo (p < 0.01). The greatest changes in NCV (at 12 months) were observed in the sensory sural nerve (7 m/sec in the LAC group vs +1.0 m/sec in the placebo group), sensory ulnar nerve (+2.9 vs +0.1 m/sec, respectively) and motor peroneal nerve (+2.7 vs -0.2 m/sec), whereas the greatest changes in amplitude were recorded in the motor peroneal nerve (+2.2 vs +0.1 mV). After 12 months of treatment, mean VAS scores for pain were significantly reduced from baseline by 39% in LAC-treated patients (p < 0.0 vs baseline) compared with 8% in placebo recipients. LAC was well tolerated over the study period. LAC was effective and well tolerated in improving neurophysiological parameters and in reducing pain over a 1-year period. LAC is, therefore, a promising treatment option in patients with diabetic neuropathy.	Levacecarnine	PUBMED	('MEDICAL', [('MED', -4.36574100604048e-06), ('ICAL', 0.0)])

This study aims to explore the interplay between lung microbiota, dysregulated metabolites, and host immunity in CIP. We recruited thirteen hospitalized CIP patients, eleven idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients, and ten new-onset non-small cell lung cancer patients. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The percentages of immune cells were determined using manual counting and flow cytometry. Interactions among microbiota, metabolites, and lymphocytes were analyzed using cultured mouse splenocytes and human T cells. Proteobacteria emerged as the dominant phylum, notably abundant in both the CIP and IPF groups. Vibrio, Halomonas, Mangrovibacter, and Salinivibrio were the predominant microbiota because of their discriminative abundance patterns. Vibrio (r = 0.72, P-adj = 0.007) and Halomonas (r = 0.65, P-adj = 0.023) demonstrated strong correlations with lymphocytes. Vibrio metschnikovii and Mangrovibacter plantisponsors were more abundant in the CIP group than in the IPF group. Lauroylcarnitine, a key intermediary metabolite co-occurring with the predominant microbiota, exhibited a potent effect on cytokine secretion by mouse and human T cells, notably enhancing IFN-γ and TNF-α production from CD4 and CD8 cells in vitro. Lauroylcarnitine, co-occurring with the predominant lung microbiota in CIP, could activate T cells in vitro. These findings suggest potential involvement of lung microbiota and acylcarnitine metabolism dysregulation in the pathogenesis of CIP. This work was supported by Peking University People's Hospital Scientific Research Development Funds (RDJ2022-15) and Provincial Key Clinical Specialty Capacity Building Project 2020 (Department of the Respiratory Medicine). We investigated optimum formulation characteristics in the nasal absorption of salmon calcitonin (sCT) by incorporation of acylcarnitines. Nasal sCT formulations were administered to anesthetized rats. Plasma calcium level was measured and pharmacological bioavailability (P.bioav) was calculated. Nasal sCT absorption was significantly enhanced by carnitines with acyl groups of 12 or more carbon atoms. Enhancement by lauroylcarnitine chloride (LCC) was observed at its critical micelle concentration and reached a plateau at the concentration of 0.1 percent. Optimal absorption was achieved at a molar ratio of LCC to sCT of 5:1. Enhancement was not influenced by osmolarity and maximum enhancement was obtained at pHs 3.1 and 4.0. The 12-carbon LCC was the strongest enhancer among acylcarnitines. Micelle formation played a key role in this enhancement effect.

1293.0	('Trimethyllysine', 'N-trimethyllysine', 'Epsilon-trimethyllysine', 'Epsilon-trimethyl-l-lysine', 'Epsilon-n-trimethyl-l-lysine')	mouse	 Trimethyllysine is an important post-translationally modified amino acid with functions in the carnitine biosynthesis and regulation of key epigenetic processes. Protein lysine methyltransferases and demethylases dynamically control protein lysine methylation, with each state of methylation changing the biophysical properties of lysine and the subsequent effect on protein function, in particular histone proteins and their central role in epigenetics. Epigenetic reader domain proteins can distinguish between different lysine methylation states and initiate downstream cellular processes upon recognition. Dysregulation of protein methylation is linked to various diseases, including cancer, inflammation, and genetic disorders. In this review, we cover biomolecular studies on the role of trimethyllysine in carnitine biosynthesis, different enzymatic reactions involved in the synthesis and removal of trimethyllysine, trimethyllysine recognition by reader proteins, and the role of trimethyllysine on the nucleosome assembly. Background Trimethyllysine, a trimethylamine N-oxide precursor, has been identified as an independent cardiovascular risk factor in acute coronary syndrome. However, limited data are available to examine the role of trimethyllysine in the population with stroke. We aimed to examine the relationship between plasma trimethyllysine levels and stroke outcomes in patients presenting with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Methods and Results Data of 10 027 patients with ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack from the CNSR-III (Third China National Stroke Registry) and 1-year follow-up data for stroke outcomes were analyzed. Plasma levels of trimethyllysine were measured with mass spectrometry. The association between trimethyllysine and stroke outcomes was analyzed using Cox regression models. Mediation analysis was performed to examine the mediation effects of risk factors on the associations of trimethyllysine and stroke outcomes. Elevated trimethyllysine levels were associated with increased risk of cardiovascular death (quartile 4 versus quartile 1: adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.72; 95% CI, 1.03-2.86) and all-cause mortality (quartile 4 versus quartile 1: HR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.40-2.78) in multivariate Cox regression model. However, no associations were found between trimethyllysine and nonfatal stroke recurrence or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Trimethyllysine was associated with cardiovascular death independent of trimethylamine N-oxide. Both estimated glomerular filtration rate and hs-CRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) had significant mediation effects on the association of trimethyllysine with cardiovascular death, with a mediation effect of 37.8% and 13.4%, respectively. Conclusions Elevated trimethyllysine level is associated with cardiovascular death among patients with ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack. Mediation analyses propose that trimethyllysine contributes to cardiovascular death through inflammation and renal function, suggesting a possible pathomechanistic link.

In this paper measurements of the turnover of oxindole-3-acetic acid are presented and used to calculate the rate of indole-3-acetic acid oxidation. [3H]Oxindole-3-acetic acid was applied to the endosperm of Zea mays seedlings and allowed to equilibrate for 24 h before the start of the experiment. The subsequent decrease in its specific activity was used to calculate the turnover rate. The average half-life of oxindole-3-acetic acid in the shoots was found to be 30 h while that in the kernels had an average half-life of 35h. Using previously published values of the pool sizes of oxindole-3-acetic acid in shoots and kernels from seedlings of the same age and variety, and grown under the same conditions, the rate of indole-3-acetic acid oxidation was calculated to be 1.1 pmol plant-1 h-1 in the shoots and 7.1 pmol plant-1 h-1 in the kernels. The components contributing to the antioxidative activity of supersweet corn powder (SSCP), which is commonly used in corn soup and snacks in Japan, were clarified and the effects investigated. 7-(O-β-Glucosyloxy)oxindole-3-acetic acid (GOA) was found to be the component most strongly contributing to the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging activity of the 80% ethanol extract of SSCP, and the presence of its aglycone, 7-hydroxy-oxindole-3-acetic acid (HOA) was confirmed. GOA and HOA respectively contributed 35.1% and 10.5% to the DPPH radical-scavenging activity of the 80% ethanol extract of SSCP. Mice orally administered with HOA at doses of both 500 and 1500 mg/kg showed a significantly lower (p<0.05) level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in the plasma than the vehicle-treated control. These results suggest that GOA and HOA were at least partly involved in the antioxidative activity of SSCP in vitro and that HOA might have possessed antioxidative activity in vivo. A prior study (13) from this laboratory showed that oxidation of exogenously applied indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) to oxindole-3-acetic acid (OxIAA) is the major catabolic pathway for IAA in Zea mays endosperm. In this work, we demonstrate that OxIAA is a naturally occurring compound in shoot and endosperm tissue of Z. mays and that the amount of OxIAA in both shoot and endosperm tissue is approximately the same as the amount of free IAA. Oxindole-3-acetic acid has been reported to be inactive in growth promotion, and thus the rate of oxidation of IAA to OxIAA could be a determinant of IAA levels in Z. mays seedlings and could play a role in the regulation of IAA-mediated growth.

The precursor for synthesis of spermine is the amino acid ornithine. It is an essential growth factor in some bacteria as well. It is found as a polycation at physiological pH. Spermine is associated with nucleic acids and is thought to stabilize helical structure, particularly in viruses. It functions as an intracellular free radical scavenger to protect DNA from free radical attack. Spermine is the chemical primarily responsible for the characteristic odor of semen. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek first described crystals of spermine phosphate in human semen in 1678. The name spermin was first used by the German chemists Ladenburg and Abel in 1888, and the correct structure of spermine was not finally established until 1926, simultaneously in England (by Dudley, Rosenheim, and Starling) and Germany (by Wrede et al.). == Derivative == A derivative of spermine, N1, N12-bis(ethyl)spermine (also known as BESm) was investigated in the late 1980s along with similar polyamine analogues for its potential as a cancer therapy. == Biosynthesis == Spermine biosynthesis in animals starts with decarboxylation of ornithine by the enzyme Ornithine decarboxylase in the presence of PLP. This decarboxylation gives putrescine. Thereafter the enzyme spermidine synthase effects two N-alkylation by decarboxy-S-adenosyl methionine. The intermediate is spermidine. Plants employ additional routes to spermine. In one pathway L-glutamine is the precursor to L-ornithine, after which the synthesis of spermine from L-ornithine follows the same pathway as in animals. Another pathway in plants starts with decarboxylation of L-arginine to produce agmatine. The imine functional group in agmatine then is hydrolysed by agmatine deiminase, releasing ammonia, converting the guanidine group into a urea. The resulting N-carbamoylputrescine is acted on by a hydrolase to split off the urea group, leaving putrescine. After that the putrescine follows the same pathway to completing the synthesis of spermine. == References == == Further reading == Slocum, R. D., Flores, H.

Increased propionylcarnitine (C3) is regarded as a biomarker of vitamin B12 deficiency. The retrospective study was undertaken to determine whether increased propionylcarnitine and low methionine in newborns are associated with hypospadias. 41 newborns with hypospadias and 90 control newborns without congenital anomalies were investigated. Whole blood propionylcarnitine and methionine concentrations were measured using tandem mass spectrometry. The mean concentration of propionylcarnitine was higher in newborns with hypospadias compared with newborns without congenital anomalies (p = 0.026). The mean methionine level in cases was insignificantly lower than in controls. There appears to be an association between decreased vitamin B12, as indexed by an increase of propionylcarnitine, and hypospadias in the investigated group of patients. The genetic and environmental determinants of serum propionylcarnitine concentrations (PC) remain largely unexplored. This study investigated the impact of genetic and environmental factors on serum propionylcarnitine levels in middle-aged and elderly participants from the Ansan/Ansung cohort of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study. Our goal was to understand the role of PC on the risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) leading to cardiovascular disease, particularly concerning branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism. We analyzed participants' demographic, lifestyle, and biochemical data with and without MetS. Serum metabolite concentrations, including carnitine, acylcarnitine, and amino acid concentrations, were measured, and the components of MetS were evaluated. Genetic variants associated with low and high PC were selected using genome-wide association studies after adjusting for MetS-related parameters. Further, genetic variants and lifestyle factors that interacted with the polygenic risk score (PRS) were analyzed. Participants with MetS were older and less educated, and their alcohol intake was higher than non-MetS participants. PC was significantly associated with the MetS risk and increased the serum levels of BCAAs and other amino acids. Higher PC positively correlated with MetS components, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular risk factors. Intake of calcium, sodium, and vitamin D were inversely associated with PC, but coffee consumption was positively linked to PC. Multiple C2 And Transmembrane Domain Containing-1 ( Orofacial clefts are thought to be determined by the interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Experiments on animals demonstrated that vitamin B12 supplemented diets antagonize selected teratogens during palatogenesis.

The mean concentrations of propionylcarnitine in newborns with clefts and controls were 2.82±1.06µmolL(-1) and 2.68±0.94µmolL(-1), respectively. T-test for equality of means did not confirm any significant differences between both groups (P=0.381).

Cytidine is a component of RNA. It is a white water-soluble solid that is only slightly soluble in ethanol. == Dietary sources == Dietary sources of cytidine include foods with high RNA (ribonucleic acid) content, such as organ meats, brewer's yeast, as well as pyrimidine-rich foods such as beer. During digestion, RNA-rich foods are broken-down into ribosyl pyrimidines (cytidine and uridine), which are absorbed intact.

3082.0	('Phenylalanine', '(s)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid', '(2s)-2-amino-3-phenylpropanoic acid', '(s)-phenylalanine', '(l)-phenylalanine')	mouse	"Phenylalanine (symbol Phe or F) is an essential α-amino acid with the formula C9H11NO2. It can be viewed as a benzyl group substituted for the methyl group of alanine, or a phenyl group in place of a terminal hydrogen of alanine. This essential amino acid is classified as neutral, and nonpolar because of the inert and hydrophobic nature of the benzyl side chain. The L-isomer is used to biochemically form proteins coded for by DNA. Phenylalanine is a precursor for tyrosine, the monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline), and the biological pigment melanin. It is encoded by the messenger RNA codons UUU and UUC. Phenylalanine is found naturally in the milk of mammals. It is used in the manufacture of food and drink products and sold as a nutritional supplement as it is a direct precursor to the neuromodulator phenethylamine. As an essential amino acid, phenylalanine is not synthesized de novo in humans and other animals, who must ingest phenylalanine or phenylalanine-containing proteins. The one-letter symbol F was assigned to phenylalanine for its phonetic similarity. == History == The first description of phenylalanine was made in 1879, when Schulze and Barbieri identified a compound with the empirical formula, C9H11NO2, in yellow lupine (Lupinus luteus) seedlings. In 1882, Erlenmeyer and Lipp first synthesized phenylalanine from phenylacetaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, and ammonia. The genetic codon for phenylalanine was first discovered by J. Heinrich Matthaei and Marshall W. Nirenberg in 1961. They showed that by using mRNA to insert multiple uracil repeats into the genome of the bacterium E. coli, they could cause the bacterium to produce a polypeptide consisting solely of repeated phenylalanine amino acids. This discovery helped to establish the nature of the coding relationship that links information stored in genomic nucleic acid with protein expression in the living cell. == Dietary sources == Good sources of phenylalanine are eggs, chicken, liver, beef, milk, and soybeans. Another common source of phenylalanine is anything sweetened with the artificial sweetener aspartame, such as diet drinks, diet foods and medication; the metabolism of aspartame produces phenylalanine as one of the compound's metabolites. == Dietary recommendations == The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the U.S. Institute of Medicine set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for essential amino acids in 2002. For phenylalanine plus tyrosine, for adults 19 years and older, 33 mg/kg body weight/day. In 2005 the DRI is set to 27 mg/kg per day (with no tyrosine), the FAO/WHO/UNU recommendation of 2007 is 25 mg/kg per day (with no tyrosine). == Other biological roles == L-Phenylalanine is biologically converted into L-tyrosine, another one of the DNA-encoded amino acids. L-tyrosine in turn is converted into L-DOPA, which is further converted into dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline). The latter three are known as the catecholamines. Phenylalanine uses the same active transport channel as tryptophan to cross the blood–brain barrier. In excessive quantities, supplementation can interfere with the production of serotonin and other aromatic amino acids as well as nitric oxide due to the overuse (eventually, limited availability) of the associated cofactors, iron or tetrahydrobiopterin. The corresponding enzymes for those compounds are the aromatic amino acid hydroxylase family and nitric oxide synthase. === In plants === Phenylalanine is the starting compound used in the synthesis of flavonoids. Lignan is derived from phenylalanine and from tyrosine. Phenylalanine is converted to cinnamic acid by the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia-lyase. == Biosynthesis == Phenylalanine is biosynthesized via the shikimate pathway. == Phenylketonuria == The genetic disorder phenylketonuria (PKU) is the inability to metabolize phenylalanine because of a lack of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Individuals with this disorder are known as ""phenylketonurics"" and must regulate their intake of phenylalanine. Phenylketonurics often use blood tests to monitor the amount of phenylalanine in their blood. Lab results may report phenylalanine levels using either mg/dL and μmol/L. One mg/dL of phenylalanine is approximately equivalent to 60 μmol/L. A (rare) ""variant form"" of phenylketonuria called hyperphenylalaninemia is caused by the inability to synthesize a cofactor called tetrahydrobiopterin, which can be supplemented. Pregnant women with hyperphenylalaninemia may show similar symptoms of the disorder (high levels of phenylalanine in blood), but these indicators will usually disappear at the end of gestation. Pregnant women with PKU must control their blood phenylalanine levels even if the fetus is heterozygous for the defective gene because the fetus could be adversely affected due to hepatic immaturity. A non-food source of phenylalanine is the artificial sweetener aspartame. This compound is metabolized by the body into several chemical byproducts including phenylalanine. The breakdown problems phenylketonurics have with the buildup of phenylalanine in the body also occurs with the ingestion of aspartame, although to a lesser degree. Accordingly, all products in Australia, the U.S. and Canada that contain aspartame must be labeled: ""Phenylketonurics: Contains phenylalanine."" In the UK, foods containing aspartame must carry ingredient panels that refer to the presence of ""aspartame or E951"" and they must be labeled with a warning ""Contains a source of phenylalanine."" In Brazil, the label ""Contém Fenilalanina"" (Portuguese for ""Contains Phenylalanine"") is also mandatory in products which contain it. These warnings are placed to help individuals avoid such foods. == D-, L- and DL-phenylalanine == The stereoisomer D-phenylalanine (DPA) can be produced by conventional organic synthesis, either as a single enantiomer or as a component of the racemic mixture. It does not participate in protein biosynthesis although it is found in proteins in small amounts - particularly aged proteins and food proteins that have been processed. The biological functions of D-amino acids remain unclear, although D-phenylalanine has pharmacological activity at niacin receptor 2. DL-Phenylalanine (DLPA) is marketed as a nutritional supplement for its purported analgesic and antidepressant activities, which have been supported by clinical trials. DL-Phenylalanine is a mixture of D-phenylalanine and L-phenylalanine. The reputed analgesic activity of DL-phenylalanine may be explained by the possible blockage by D-phenylalanine of enkephalin degradation by the enzyme carboxypeptidase A. Enkephalins act as agonists of the mu and delta opioid receptors, and agonists of these receptors are known to produce antidepressant effects. The mechanism of DL-phenylalanine's supposed antidepressant activity may also be accounted for in part by the precursor role of L-phenylalanine in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine, though clinical trials have not found an antidepressant effect from L-phenylalanine alone. Elevated brain levels of norepinephrine and dopamine are thought to have an antidepressant effect. D-Phenylalanine is absorbed from the small intestine and transported to the liver via the portal circulation. A small amount of D-phenylalanine appears to be converted to L-phenylalanine. D-Phenylalanine is distributed to the various tissues of the body via the systemic circulation. It appears to cross the blood–brain barrier less efficiently than L-phenylalanine, and so a small amount of an ingested dose of D-phenylalanine is excreted in the urine without penetrating the central nervous system. L-Phenylalanine is an antagonist at α2δ Ca2+ calcium channels with a Ki of 980 nM. In the brain, L-phenylalanine is a competitive antagonist at the glycine binding site of NMDA receptor and at the glutamate binding site of AMPA receptor. At the glycine binding site of NMDA receptor L-phenylalanine has an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (KB) of 573 μM estimated by Schild regression which is considerably lower than brain L-phenylalanine concentration observed in untreated human phenylketonuria. L-Phenylalanine also inhibits neurotransmitter release at glutamatergic synapses in hippocampus and cortex with IC50 of 980 μM, a brain concentration seen in classical phenylketonuria, whereas D-phenylalanine has a significantly smaller effect. == Commercial synthesis == L-Phenylalanine is produced for medical, feed, and nutritional applications, such as aspartame, in large quantities by utilizing the bacterium Escherichia coli, which naturally produces aromatic amino acids like phenylalanine. The quantity of L-phenylalanine produced commercially has been increased by genetically engineering E. coli, such as by altering the regulatory promoters or amplifying the number of genes controlling enzymes responsible for the synthesis of the amino acid. == Derivatives == Boronophenylalanine (BPA) is a dihydroxyboryl derivative of phenylalanine, used in neutron capture therapy. 4-Azido-L-phenylalanine is a protein-incorporated unnatural amino acid used as a tool for bioconjugation in the field of chemical biology. == See also == Phenylalaninol == References == == External links == Phenylalanine mass spectrum Phenylalanine at ChemSynthesis"	Phenylalanine	WIKIPEDIA	('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.024978602305054665), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.3134472966194153), (' PERSONAL', -0.7500819563865662), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.048647768795490265), (' MED', -0.36741673946380615), ('ICAL', 0.0)])

Batyl alcohol and related glycyl ethers are susceptible to oxidation catalyzed by glyceryl-ether monooxygenases. The net oxidation gives glycerol and the carboxylic acid: HOCH2CH(OH)CH2OC18H37 + 1.5 O2 → HOCH2CH(OH)CH2OH + HO2CHC17H35 + H2O Batyl alcohol and related glycyl ethers are also susceptible to dehydrogenation catalyzed unsaturases to give the vinyl ethers called plasmalogens: HOCH2CH(OH)CH2OC18H37 + [O] → HOCH2CH(OH)CH2OCH=CHC16H35 + H2O == References ==	Batyl alcohol	WIKIPEDIA	('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0017121860291808844)])
1844.0	('Lactose', '.beta.-lactose', 'Beta-d-glucopyranose, 4-o-beta-d-galactopyranosyl-', 'Beta-d-lactose', 'Beta-lactose')	mouse	"Lactose, or milk sugar, is a disaccharide composed of galactose and glucose and has the molecular formula C12H22O11. Lactose makes up around 2–8% of milk (by mass). The name comes from lact (gen. lactis), the Latin word for milk, plus the suffix -ose used to name sugars. The compound is a white, water-soluble, non-hygroscopic solid with a mildly sweet taste. It is used in the food industry. == Structure and reactions == Lactose is a disaccharide composed of galactose and glucose, which form a β-1→4 glycosidic linkage. Its systematic name is β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1→4)-D-glucose. The glucose can be in either the α-pyranose form or the β-pyranose form, whereas the galactose can have only the β-pyranose form: hence α-lactose and β-lactose refer to the anomeric form of the glucopyranose ring alone. Detection reactions for lactose are the Wöhlk- and Fearon's test. They can be used to detect the different lactose content of dairy products such as whole milk, lactose free milk, yogurt, buttermilk, coffee creamer, sour cream, kefir, etc. Lactose is hydrolysed to glucose and galactose, isomerised in alkaline solution to lactulose, and catalytically hydrogenated to the corresponding polyhydric alcohol, lactitol. Lactulose is a commercial product, used for treatment of constipation. == Occurrence and isolation == Lactose comprises about 2–8% of milk by weight. Several million tons are produced annually as a by-product of the dairy industry. Whey or milk plasma is the liquid remaining after milk is curdled and strained, for example in the production of cheese. Whey is made up of 6.5% solids, of which 4.8% is lactose, which is purified by crystallisation. Industrially, lactose is produced from whey permeate – whey filtrated for all major proteins. The protein fraction is used in infant nutrition and sports nutrition while the permeate can be evaporated to 60–65% solids and crystallized while cooling. Lactose can also be isolated by dilution of whey with ethanol. == Metabolism == Infant mammals nurse on their mothers to drink milk, which is rich in lactose. The intestinal villi secrete the enzyme lactase (β-D-galactosidase) to digest it. This enzyme cleaves the lactose molecule into its two subunits, the simple sugars glucose and galactose, which can be absorbed. Since lactose occurs mostly in milk, in most mammals, the production of lactase gradually decreases with maturity due to weaning; the removal of lactose from the diet removes the metabolic pressure to continue to produce lactase for its digestion. Many people with ancestry in Europe, West Asia, South Asia, the Sahel belt in West Africa, East Africa and a few other parts of Central Africa maintain lactase production into adulthood due to selection for genes that continue lactase production. In many of these areas, milk from mammals such as cattle, goats, and sheep is used as a large source of food. It was in these regions that genes for lifelong lactase production first evolved. The genes of adult lactose tolerance have evolved independently in various ethnic groups. By descent, more than 70% of western Europeans can digest lactose as adults, compared with less than 30% of people from areas of Africa, eastern and south-eastern Asia and Oceania. In people who are lactose intolerant, lactose is not broken down and provides food for gas-producing gut flora, which can lead to diarrhea, bloating, flatulence, and other gastrointestinal symptoms. == Biological properties == The sweetness of lactose is 0.2 to 0.4, relative to 1.0 for sucrose. For comparison, the sweetness of glucose is 0.6 to 0.7, of fructose is 1.3, of galactose is 0.5 to 0.7, of maltose is 0.4 to 0.5, of sorbose is 0.4, and of xylose is 0.6 to 0.7. When lactose is completely digested in the small intestine, its caloric value is 4 kcal/g, or the same as that of other carbohydrates. However, lactose is not always fully digested in the small intestine. Depending on ingested dose, combination with meals (either solid or liquid), and lactase activity in the intestines, the caloric value of lactose ranges from 2 to 4 kcal/g. Undigested lactose acts as dietary fiber. It also has positive effects on absorption of minerals, such as calcium and magnesium. The glycemic index of lactose is 46 to 65. For comparison, the glycemic index of glucose is 100 to 138, of sucrose is 68 to 92, of maltose is 105, and of fructose is 19 to 27. Lactose has relatively low cariogenicity among sugars. This is because it is not a substrate for dental plaque formation and it is not rapidly fermented by oral bacteria. The buffering capacity of milk also reduces the cariogenicity of lactose. == Applications == Its mild flavor and easy handling properties have led to its use as a carrier and stabiliser of aromas and pharmaceutical products. Lactose is not commonly added directly to food, because its low solubility can lead to a gritty mouthfeel. Infant formula is a notable exception, where lactose is added to match the composition of human milk. However, lactose-reduced formulas are increasing in popularity. One of the undesirable properties of lactose utilization is its low solubility, which can result in crystallization, giving a gritty and sandy mouthfeel in the final product. Usually, in supersaturated solution, sugars tend to crystallize, also forming big agglomerates, depending on the process condition. Lactose is not fermented by most yeast during brewing, which may be used to advantage. For example, lactose may be used to sweeten stout beer; the resulting beer is usually called a milk stout or a cream stout. Yeast belonging to the genus Kluyveromyces have a unique industrial application, as they are capable of fermenting lactose for ethanol production. Surplus lactose from the whey by-product of dairy operations is a potential source of alternative energy. Another significant lactose use is in the pharmaceutical industry. Lactose is added to tablet and capsule drug products as an ingredient because of its physical and functional properties (examples are atorvastatin, levocetirizine or thiamazole among many others). For similar reasons, it can be used to dilute illicit drugs such as cocaine or heroin. == History == The first crude isolation of lactose, by Italian physician Fabrizio Bartoletti (1576–1630), was published in 1633. In 1700, the Venetian pharmacist Lodovico Testi (1640–1707) published a booklet of testimonials to the power of milk sugar (saccharum lactis) to relieve, among other ailments, the symptoms of arthritis. In 1715, Testi's procedure for making milk sugar was published by Antonio Vallisneri. Lactose was identified as a sugar in 1780 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele. In 1812, Heinrich Vogel (1778–1867) recognized that glucose was a product of hydrolyzing lactose. In 1856, Louis Pasteur crystallized the other component of lactose, galactose. By 1894, Emil Fischer had established the configurations of the component sugars. Lactose was named by the French chemist Jean Baptiste André Dumas (1800–1884) in 1843. In 1856, Pasteur named galactose ""lactose"". In 1860, Marcellin Berthelot renamed it ""galactose"", and transferred the name ""lactose"" to what is now called lactose. It has a formula of C12H22O11 and the hydrate formula C12H22O11·H2O, making it an isomer of sucrose. == See also == Lac operon Lactic acid Lactose intolerance Nectar Sugars in wine == References == == External links == Media related to Lactose at Wikimedia Commons"	Lactose	WIKIPEDIA	('FOOD, INDUSTRIAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -0.0011871340684592724), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.16026607155799866), (' INDUSTR', -0.5768909454345703), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.5761055946350098), (' PERSONAL', -0.5232719779014587), (' CARE', 0.0)])

In nematodes and human placentas, phosphocholine is selectively attached to other proteins as a posttranslational modification to suppress an immune response by their hosts. It is also one of the binding targets of C-reactive protein (CRP). Thus, when a cell is damaged, CRP binds to phosphocholine, beginning the recognition and phagocytotic immunologic response.

The effect is mediated by two major subtypes of receptors (A 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) exacerbates mitochondrial impairment and α-synuclein expression leading to Parkinsonism. Impaired mitochondria and over-expressed α-synuclein are degraded and eliminated via macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy. Owing to multiple properties, silymarin protects from oxidative stress-mediated cellular injury. However, its effect on MPTP-induced changes in autophagy is not yet known. The study aimed to decipher the effect of silymarin on MPTP-induced changes in autophagy. Male mice (20-25 g) were treated with silymarin (intraperitoneally, daily, 40 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. On day 7, a few animals were also administered with MPTP (intraperitoneally, 20 mg/kg, 4 injections at 2-h interval) along with vehicles. Striatal dopamine content was determined. Western blot analysis was done to assess α-synuclein, beclin-1, sequestosome, phosphorylated 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK), lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP-2), heat shock cognate-70 (Hsc-70), LAMP-2A, phosphorylated unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase (p-Ulk1), and phosphorylated mechanistic target of rapamycin (p-mTOR) levels in the nigrostriatal tissue. Silymarin rescued from MPTP-induced increase in beclin-1, sequestosome, p-AMPK, and p-Ulk1 and decrease in LAMP-2, p-mTOR, and LAMP-2A levels. Silymarin defended against MPTP-induced increase in α-synuclein and reduction in dopamine content. The results demonstrate that silymarin protects against MPTP-induced changes in autophagy leading to Parkinsonism. The catalytic mechanism of the majority of S-adenosyl methionine (AdoMet)-dependent methyl transferases requires no divalent metal ions. Here we report that methyl transfer from AdoMet to N(1) of G37-tRNA, catalyzed by the bacterial TrmD enzyme, is strongly dependent on divalent metal ions and that Mg(2+) is the most physiologically relevant. Kinetic isotope analysis, metal rescue, and spectroscopic measurements indicate that Mg(2+) is not involved in substrate binding, but in promoting methyl transfer. On the basis of the pH-activity profile indicating one proton transfer during the TrmD reaction, we propose a catalytic mechanism in which the role of Mg(2+) is to help to increase the nucleophilicity of N(1) of G37 and stabilize the negative developing charge on O(6) during attack on the methyl sulfonium of AdoMet. This work demonstrates how Mg(2+) contributes to the catalysis of AdoMet-dependent methyl transfer in one of the most crucial posttranscriptional modifications to tRNA.

34245.0	('Ferulic acid', 'Trans-ferulic acid', 'Trans-4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid', '(e)-ferulic acid', 'Ferulate')	mouse	Ferulic acid is a hydroxycinnamic acid derivative and a phenolic compound. It is an organic compound with the formula (CH3O)HOC6H3CH=CHCO2H. The name is derived from the genus Ferula, referring to the giant fennel (Ferula communis). Classified as a phenolic phytochemical, ferulic acid is an amber colored solid. Esters of ferulic acid are found in plant cell walls, covalently bonded to hemicellulose such as arabinoxylans. Salts and esters derived from ferulic acid are called ferulates. == Occurrence in nature == Ferulic acid is ubiquitous in the plant kingdom, including a number of vegetable sources. It occurs in particularly high concentrations in popcorn and bamboo shoots. It is a major metabolite of chlorogenic acids in humans along with caffeic and isoferulic acid, and is absorbed in the small intestine, whereas other metabolites such as dihydroferulic acid, feruloylglycine and dihydroferulic acid sulfate are produced from chlorogenic acid in the large intestine by the action of gut flora. In cereals, ferulic acid is localized in the bran – the hard outer layer of grain. In wheat, phenolic compounds are mainly found in the form of insoluble bound ferulic acid and may be relevant to resistance to wheat fungal diseases. The highest known concentration of ferulic acid glucoside has been found in flaxseed (4.1±0.2 g/kg). It is also found in barley grain. Asterid eudicot plants can also produce ferulic acid. The tea brewed from the leaves of yacón (Smallanthus sonchifolius), a plant traditionally grown in the northern and central Andes, contains quantities of ferulic acid. In legumes, the white bean variety navy bean is the richest source of ferulic acid among the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) varieties. It is also found in horse grams (Macrotyloma uniflorum). Although there are many sources of ferulic acid in nature, its bioavailability depends on the form in which it is present: free ferulic acid has limited solubility in water, and hence poor bioavailability. In wheat grain, ferulic acid is found bound to cell wall polysaccharides, allowing it to be released and absorbed in the small intestine. === In processed foods === Cooked sweetcorn releases increased levels of ferulic acid. As plant sterol esters, this compound is naturally found in rice bran oil, a popular cooking oil in several Asian countries. Ferulic acid glucoside can be found in commercial breads containing flaxseed. Rye bread contains ferulic acid dehydrodimers. == Metabolism == === Biosynthesis === Ferulic acid is biosynthesized in plants from caffeic acid by the action of the enzyme caffeate O-methyltransferase. In a proposed ferulic acid biosynthetic pathway for Escherichia coli, L-tyrosine is converted to 4-coumaric acid by tyrosine ammonia lyase, which is converted to caffeic acid by Sam5, which is then converted to ferulic acid by caffeic acid methyltransferase. Ferulic acid, together with dihydroferulic acid, is a component of lignocellulose, serving to crosslink the lignin and polysaccharides, thereby conferring rigidity to the cell walls. It is an intermediate in the synthesis of monolignols, the monomers of lignin, and is also used for the synthesis of lignans. === Biodegradation === Ferulic acid is converted by certain strains of yeast, notably strains used in brewing of wheat beers, such as Saccharomyces delbrueckii (Torulaspora delbrueckii), to 4-vinyl guaiacol (2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol) which gives beers such as Weissbier and Wit their distinctive clove-like flavour. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (dry baker's yeast) and Pseudomonas fluorescens are also able to convert trans-ferulic acid into 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol. In P. fluorescens, a ferulic acid decarboxylase has been isolated. == Ecology == Ferulic acid is one of the compounds that initiate the vir (virulence) region of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, inducing it to infect plant cells. == Extraction == It can be extracted from wheat bran and maize bran using concentrated alkali. == See also == Caffeic acid Coumaric acid Diferulic acids Eugenol Isoferulic acid, an isomer of ferulic acid == References ==	Ferulic acid	WIKIPEDIA	('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.001088066608645022), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.10025854408740997), (' PERSONAL', -0.08228421956300735), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.25337302684783936), (' INDUSTR', -0.2539803683757782), ('IAL', 0.0)])

However, simultaneous hair removal is important. No single method for hair removal is appropriate for all patients and skin areas. Treatment options are actually limited and clinical results are often unsatisfactory. Ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1), an enzyme present in hair follicles, is considered as a potential target to inhibit hair growth. Only eflornithine hydrochloride, an inhibitor of ODC1, showed to be partially effective in the management of acquired HT. The aim of our study was to evaluate the potential inhibition of ODC1 activity by a cream containing 4% capryloyl glycine, an ODC1 inhibitor, and 1% glycine soy-fermented extract (soy isoflavonoids). Furthermore, we present the results of a placebo-controlled clinical study that evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of this cream. The ODC1 activity was detected by measuring absorbance at 340 nm. In the presence of ODC1 inhibitors, absorbance decreases as a function of inhibition. Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) was provided as an inhibitor control. ODC1 activity inhibition was expressed as percentage of control (untreated sample). All data were presented as mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments. To determine if statistically significant differences between treatments were present, a t test analysis was performed. The differences between groups were considered significant at p < 0.05. Twelve Caucasian female adult patients, with HT located on the forearms, were enrolled. The study cream (product A) was applied twice/day for four months on the right forearm. A placebo cream (product B) was applied twice/day for four months on the left forearm. Clinical efficacy was evaluated by means of macrophotography. The cream significantly inhibited ODC1 activity (35.1 ± 0.5% inhibition, equivalent to a 64.9 ± 0.5% ODC1 activity). DFMO completely abolished the enzymatic activity (100 ± 5% inhibition, equivalent to 0 ± 5% ODC1 activity). All patients were considered evaluable. In 11 out of 12 patients (91.7%), who were treated with product A, an improvement was observed. No improvement was observed in patients treated with product B.

Gemcitabine is a first-line chemotherapeutic agent for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Gemcitabine Elaidate (Gem Elaidate) is a lipophilic derivative which allows hENT1-independent intracellular delivery of gemcitabine and better pharmacokinetics and entrapment in a nanocarrier. Cancer cells and neovasculature are negatively charged compared to healthy cells. Palmitoyl-DL-carnitine chloride (PC) is a Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor which also provides a cationic surface charge to nanoliposomes for targeting tumor neovasculature and augmented anticancer potency. The objectives of our study are: (a) to develop and characterize a PKC inhibitor-anchored Gem Elaidate-loaded PEGylated nanoliposome (PGPLs) and (b) to investigate the anticancer activity of Gem Elaidate and PGPLs in 2D and 3D models of pancreatic cancer. The optimized PGPLs resulted in a particle size of 80 ± 2.31 nm, a polydispersity index of 0.15 ± 0.05 and a ζ-potential of +31.6 ± 3.54 mV, with a 93.25% encapsulation efficiency of Gem Elaidate in PGPLs. Our results demonstrate higher cellular uptake, inhibition in migration, as well as angiogenesis potential and significant apoptosis induced by PGPLs in 3D multicellular tumor spheroids of pancreatic cancer cells. Hence, PGPLs could be an effective and novel nanoformulation for the neovasculature-specific delivery of Gemcitabine Elaidate to treat PDAC. Disruption of acylcarnitine homeostasis results in life-threatening outcomes in humans. Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency (CACTD) is a scarce autosomal recessive genetic disease and may result in patients' death due to heart arrest or respiratory insufficiency. However, the reasons and mechanism of CACTD inducing respiratory insufficiency have never been elucidated. Herein, we employed lipidomic techniques to create comprehensive lipidomic maps of entire lungs throughout both prenatal and postnatal developmental stages in mice. We found that the acylcarnitines manifested notable variations and coordinated the expression levels of carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (Cact) across these lung developmental stages.  Circulating acyl-carnitines (acyl-CNTs) are associated with insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in both rodents and humans. However, the mechanisms whereby circulating acyl-CNTs are increased in these conditions and their role in whole-body metabolism remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine if, in humans, blood cells contribute in production of circulating acyl-CNTs and associate with whole-body fat metabolism. Eight non-diabetic healthy women (age: 47 ± 19 y; BMI: 26 ± 1 kg·m In women, blood cells contribute to plasma acyl-CNT levels and the acyl-CNT production is linked to plasma palmitate oxidation, a marker of whole-body fat metabolism. Future studies are needed to confirm the role of blood cells in acyl-CNT and lipid metabolism under different physiological (i.e., in response to meal) and pathological (i.e., hyperlipidemia, IR and T2D) conditions.

2131.0	('Trehalose', 'Mycose', 'Alpha,alpha-trehalose', 'Ergot sugar', 'Alpha-d-trehalose')	mouse	Trehalose (from Turkish tıgala – a sugar derived from insect cocoons + -ose) is a sugar consisting of two molecules of glucose. It is also known as mycose or tremalose. Some bacteria, fungi, plants and invertebrate animals synthesize it as a source of energy, and to survive freezing and lack of water. Extracting trehalose was once a difficult and costly process, but around 2000, the Hayashibara company (Okayama, Japan) discovered an inexpensive extraction technology from starch. Trehalose has high water retention capabilities, and is used in food, cosmetics and as a drug. A procedure developed in 2017 using trehalose allows sperm storage at room temperatures. == Structure == Trehalose is a disaccharide formed by a 1,1-glycosidic bond between two α-glucose units. It is found in nature as a disaccharide and also as a monomer in some polymers. Two other stereoisomers exist: α,β-trehalose, also called neotrehalose, and β,β-trehalose, also called isotrehalose. Neither of these alternate isomers has been isolated from living organisms, but isotrehalose has been was found in starch hydroisolates. == Synthesis == At least three biological pathways support trehalose biosynthesis. An industrial process can derive trehalose from corn starch. == Properties == === Chemical === Trehalose is a nonreducing sugar formed from two glucose units joined by a 1–1 alpha bond, giving it the name α-D-gluco­pyranosyl-(1→1)-α-D-gluco­pyranoside. The bonding makes trehalose very resistant to acid hydrolysis, and therefore is stable in solution at high temperatures, even under acidic conditions. The bonding keeps nonreducing sugars in closed-ring form, such that the aldehyde or ketone end groups do not bind to the lysine or arginine residues of proteins (a process called glycation). Trehalose is less soluble than sucrose, except at high temperatures (>80 °C). Trehalose forms a rhomboid crystal as the dihydrate, and has 90% of the calorific content of sucrose in that form. Anhydrous forms of trehalose readily regain moisture to form the dihydrate. Anhydrous forms of trehalose can show interesting physical properties when heat-treated. Trehalose aqueous solutions show a concentration-dependent clustering tendency. Owing to their ability to form hydrogen bonds, they self-associate in water to form clusters of various sizes. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations showed that concentrations of 1.5–2.2 molar allow trehalose molecular clusters to percolate and form large and continuous aggregates. Trehalose directly interacts with nucleic acids, facilitates melting of double stranded DNA and stabilizes single-stranded nucleic acids. === Biological === Organisms ranging from bacteria, yeast, fungi, insects, invertebrates, and lower and higher plants have enzymes that can make trehalose. In nature, trehalose can be found in plants, and microorganisms. In animals, trehalose is prevalent in shrimp, and also in insects, including grasshoppers, locusts, butterflies, and bees, in which trehalose serves as blood-sugar. Trehalase genes are found in tardigrades, the microscopic ecdysozoans found worldwide in diverse extreme environments. Trehalose is the major carbohydrate energy storage molecule used by insects for flight. One possible reason for this is that the glycosidic linkage of trehalose, when acted upon by an insect trehalase, releases two molecules of glucose, which is required for the rapid energy requirements of flight. This is double the efficiency of glucose release from the storage polymer starch, for which cleavage of one glycosidic linkage releases only one glucose molecule. The concentrations of both trehalose and glucose in the insect hemolymph are tightly controlled by multiple enzymes and hormones, including trehalase, insulin-like peptides (ILPs and DILPs), adipokinetic hormone (AKH), leucokinin (LK), octopamine and other mediators, thereby maintaining carbohydrate homeostasis by endocrine and metabolic feedback mechanisms. In plants, trehalose is seen in sunflower seeds, moonwort, Selaginella plants, and sea algae. Within the fungi, it is prevalent in some mushrooms, such as shiitake (Lentinula edodes), oyster, king oyster, and golden needle. Even within the plant kingdom, Selaginella (sometimes called the resurrection plant), which grows in desert and mountainous areas, may be cracked and dried out, but will turn green again and revive after rain because of the function of trehalose. The two prevalent theories as to how trehalose works within the organism in the state of cryptobiosis are the vitrification theory, a state that prevents ice formation, or the water displacement theory, whereby water is replaced by trehalose. In bacterial cell wall, trehalose has a structural role in adaptive responses to stress such as osmotic differences and extreme temperature. Yeast uses trehalose as a carbon source in response to abiotic stresses. In humans, the only known function of trehalose is as a neuroprotective, which it accomplishes by inducing autophagy and thereby clearing protein aggregates. Trehalose has also been reported for anti-bacterial, anti-biofilm, and anti-inflammatory (in vitro and in vivo) activities, upon its esterification with fatty acids of varying chain lengths. == Nutritional and dietary properties == Trehalose is rapidly broken down into glucose by the enzyme trehalase, which is present in the brush border of the intestinal mucosa of omnivores (including humans) and herbivores.: 135 It causes less of a spike in blood sugar than glucose. Trehalose has about 45% the sweetness of sucrose at concentrations above 22%, but when the concentration is reduced, its sweetness decreases more quickly than that of sucrose, so that a 2.3% solution tastes 6.5 times less sweet as the equivalent sugar solution.: 444 It is commonly used in prepared frozen foods, like ice cream, because it lowers the freezing point of foods. Deficiency of trehalase enzyme is unusual in humans, except in the Greenlandic Inuit, where it is present in only 10–15% of the population.: 197 == Metabolism == Five biosynthesis pathways have been reported for trehalose. The most common pathway is TPS/TPP pathway which is used by organisms that synthesize trehalose using the enzyme trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) synthase (TPS). Second, trehalose synthase (TS) in certain types of bacteria could produce trehalose by using maltose and another disaccharide with two glucose units as substrates. Third, the TreY-TreZ pathway in some bacteria converts starch that contain maltooligosaccharide or glycogen directly into trehalose. Fourth, in primitive bacteria, trehalose glycisyltransferring synthase (TreT) produces trehalose from ADP-glucose and glucose. Fifth, trehalose phosphorylase (TreP) either hydrolyses trehalose into glucose-1-phosphate and glucose or may act reversibly in certain species. Vertebrates do not have the ability to synthesize or store trehalose. Trehalase in humans is found only in specific location such as the intestinal mucosa, renal brush-border, liver and blood. Expression of this enzyme in vertebrates is initially found during the gestation period that is the highest after weaning. Then, the level of trehalase remained constant in the intestine throughout life. Meanwhile, diets consisting of plants and fungi contain trehalose. Moderate amount of trehalose in diet is essential and having low amount of trehalose could result in diarrhea, or other intestinal symptoms. == Medical use == Trehalose is an ingredient, along with hyaluronic acid, in an artificial tears product used to treat dry eye. Outbreaks of Clostridioides difficile were initially associated with trehalose, but this finding was disputed in 2019. In 2021, the FDA accepted an Investigational New Drug (IND) application and granted fast track status for an injectable form of trehalose (SLS-005) as a potential treatment for spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3). == History == In 1832, H.A.L. Wiggers discovered trehalose in an ergot of rye, and in 1859 Marcellin Berthelot isolated it from Trehala manna, a substance made by weevils and named it trehalose. Trehalose has long been known as an autophagy inducer that acts independently of mTOR. In 2017, research was published showing that trehalose induces autophagy by activating TFEB, a protein that acts as a master regulator of the autophagy-lysosome pathway. == See also == Biostasis Cryoprotectant Cryptobiosis Freeze drying Lentztrehalose Trehalosamine IMCTA-C14 == References == == External links == Media related to Trehalose at Wikimedia Commons Trehalose in sperm preservation	Trehalose	WIKIPEDIA	('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.25272631645202637), ('OD', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -0.3066912889480591), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -9.13388703338569e-06), (' MED', -0.009808625094592571), ('ICAL', 0.0)])
64758.0	"(""N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-n'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine"", 'Antioxidant cd', 'Santoflex 13', 'Wingstay 300', 'Antioxidant 4020')"	mouse	 N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD) is a type of p-phenylenediamine (PPD), which is widely used in the manufacture of rubber tires owing to its excellent antiozonant properties. In this study, the developmental cardiotoxicity of 6PPD was evaluated in zebrafish larvae, and the LC50 was approximately 737 μg/L for the larvae at 96 h post fertilization (hpf). In the 6PPD treatment of 100 μg/L, the accumulation concentrations of 6PPD were up to 2658 ng/g in zebrafish larvae, and 6PPD induced significant oxidative stress and cell apoptosis in the early developmental stages of zebrafish. Transcriptome analysis showed that 6PPD exposure could potentially cause cardiotoxicity in larval zebrafish by affecting the transcription of the genes related to the calcium signal pathway and cardiac muscle contraction. The genes related to calcium signaling pathway (slc8a2b, cacna1ab, cacna1da, and pln) were verified by qRT-PCR, which were significantly downregulated in larval zebrafish after exposing to 100 μg/L of 6PPD. Simultaneously, the mRNA levels of the genes related to cardiac functions (myl7, sox9, bmp10, and myh71) also respond accordingly. H&E staining and heart morphology investigation indicated that cardiac malformation occurred in zebrafish larvae exposed to 100 μg/L of 6PPD. Furthermore, the phenotypic observation of transgenic Tg (myl7: EGFP) zebrafish also confirmed that 100 μg/L of 6PPD exposure could change the distance of atria and ventricles of the heart and inhibit some key genes (cacnb3a, ATP2a1l, ryr1b) related to cardiac function in larval zebrafish. These results revealed the toxic effects of 6PPD on the cardiac system of zebrafish larvae. N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD) is used as a ubiquitous rubber antioxidant worldwide and has been shown to be potentially toxic to aquatic organisms. In this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to 6PPD for five days starting at two hours post-fertilization at concentrations of 0, 0.0022, 0.022, and 0.22 mg/L to investigate its effects on embryonic development, the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor (GH/IGF) axis, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. The results showed that the 96 h LC50 of 6PPD was 2.2 mg/L. 6PPD exposure decreased hatchability, lowered autonomous movement, reduced body length in zebrafish embryos and caused deformities. The hormones levels and the expression of genes related to GH/IGF and HPT axis were altered after exposure to 6PPD in zebrafish larvae. These results indicated that the GH/IGF and HPT axis was disturbed. Moreover, treatment of 6PPD produced oxidative stress in zebrafish embryos. Overall, the present study thus demonstrated that exposure to 0.22 mg/L 6PPD caused developmental toxicity and disrupted the GH/IGF and HPT axis of zebrafish, which could be responsible for developmental impairment and growth inhibition. With increasing concerns about N-(1,3-Dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD) and 6PPD-quinone (6PPD-Q), relevant environmental investigations and toxicological research have sprung up in recent years. However, limited information could be found for human body burden assessment. This work collected and analyzed 200 samples consisting of paired urine and plasma samples from participants (50 male and 50 female) in Tianjin, China. Low detection frequencies (DF, <15 %) were found except for urinary 6PPD-Q (86 %), which suggested the poor residue tendency of 6PPD and 6PPD-Q in blood. The low DFs also lead to no substantial association between two chemicals. Data analysis based on urinary 6PPD-Q showed a significant difference between males and females (p < 0.05). No significant correlation was found for other demographic factors (Body Mass Index (BMI), age, drinking, and smoking). The mean values of daily excretion (ng/kg bw/day) calculated using urinary 6PPD-Q for females and males were 7.381 ng/kg bw/day (female) and 3.360 ng/kg bw/day (male), and apparently female suffered higher daily exposure. Further analysis with daily excretion and ALT (alanine aminotransferase)/TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone)/ blood cell analysis indicators found a potential correlation with 6PPD-Q daily excretion and liver/immune functions. Considering this preliminary assessment, systematic research targeting the potential organs at relevant concentrations is required.

29104.0	('Hippuric acid', 'N-benzoylglycine', 'Benzoylglycine', 'Glycine, n-benzoyl-', 'Benzamidoacetic acid')	mouse	"Hippuric acid (Gr. hippos, horse, ouron, urine) is a carboxylic acid and organic compound. It is found in urine and is formed from the combination of benzoic acid and glycine. Levels of hippuric acid rise with the consumption of phenolic compounds (such as in fruit juice, tea and wine). The phenols are first converted to benzoic acid, and then to hippuric acid and excreted in urine. Hippuric acid crystallizes in rhombic prisms which are readily soluble in hot water, melt at 187 °C, and decompose at about 240 °C. High concentrations of hippuric acid may also indicate a toluene intoxication; however, scientists have called this correlation into question because there are other variables that affect levels of hippuric acid. When many aromatic compounds such as benzoic acid and toluene are taken internally, they are converted to hippuric acid by reaction with the amino acid, glycine. == Synthesis == A modern synthesis of hippuric acid involves the acylation of glycine with benzoyl chloride (""Schotten–Baumann reaction""). == Physiology == Biochemically, hippuric acid is produced from benzoic acid and glycine, which occurs in the liver, intestine, and kidneys. In terms of mechanism, benzoic acid is converted to benzoyl CoA, an acylating agent. Hippuric acid may be formed from the essential amino acid phenylalanine through at least two pathways. Phenylalanine undergoes biotransformation to form an alpha-keto acid, phenylpyruvic acid, which can tautomerize to a reactive enol. The benzylic carbon is reactive which undergoes peroxidation followed by the competing pathways to either react with the alpha carbon subsequently form an dioxetanol intermediate followed by formation of oxalic acid and benzaldehyde, or, peroxidation can react with the carboxyl group to form an alpha-keto-beta-peroxylactone intermediate followed by formation of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and benzaldehyde. Alternatively, under certain conditions, phenylpyruvic acid may undergo a redox mechanism, such as Iron(II) donating an electron, to directly release carbon dioxide, followed by carbon monoxide, for the formation of a stable toluene radical which is resolved by an antioxidant such as ascorbate. In all of the aforementioned cases, benzaldehyde undergoes biotransformation via CYP450 to benzoic acid followed by conjugation to glycine for formation of hippurate which undergoes urinary excretion. Similarly, toluene reacts with CYP450 to form benzaldehyde. Hippuric acid has been reported to be a marker for Parkinson's disease. == Reactions == Hippuric acid is readily hydrolysed by hot caustic alkalis to benzoic acid and glycine. Nitrous acid converts it into benzoyl glycolic acid, C6H5C(=O)OCH2CO2H. Its ethyl ester reacts with hydrazine to form hippuryl hydrazine, C6H5CONHCH2CONHNH2, which was used by Theodor Curtius for the preparation of hydrazoic acid. Hippuric acid has also been used in Erlenmeyer–Plöchl synthesis of phenylalanine and other amino acids, the reaction proceeding via an oxazolone or ""azlactone"" intermediate. == History == Justus von Liebig showed in 1829 that hippuric acid differed from benzoic acid and he named it, and in 1834 he determined its constitution, while in 1853 French chemist Victor Dessaignes (1800–1885) synthesized it by the action of benzoyl chloride on the zinc salt of glycine. It was also formed by heating benzoic anhydride with glycine, and by heating benzamide with monochloroacetic acid. == See also == para-Aminohippuric acid ortho-Iodohippuric acid Methylhippuric acid (three different isomers) == References =="	Hippuric acid	WIKIPEDIA	('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.00044008632539771497), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -4.56102097814437e-05), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.018153922632336617), (' FOOD', -6.456358823925257e-05)])
2154.0	('Trimethyl glycine', 'Cystadane', 'Carboxymethyl(trimethyl)azanium', 'N,n,n-trimethylglycinium', 'Loramine amb-13')	mouse	 Glycine betaine (N, N, N-trimethyl amine) is an osmolyte accumulated in cells that is key for cell volume and turgor regulation, is the principal methyl donor in the methionine cycle and is a DNA and proteins stabilizer. In humans, glycine betaine is synthesized from choline and can be obtained from some foods. Glycine betaine (GB) roles are illustrated in chemical, metabolic, agriculture, and clinical medical studies due to its chemical and physiological properties. Several studies have extensively described GB role and accumulation related to specific pathologies, focusing mainly on analyzing its positive and negative role in these pathologies. However, it is necessary to explain the relationship between glycine betaine and different pathologies concerning its role as an antioxidant, ability to methylate DNA, interact with transcription factors and cell receptors, and participate in the control of homocysteine concentration in liver, kidney and brain. This review summarizes the most important findings and integrates GB role in neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, hepatic, and renal diseases. Furthermore, we discuss GB impact on other dysfunctions as inflammation, oxidative stress, and glucose metabolism, to understand their cross-talks and provide reliable data to establish a base for further investigations. The aim of this research work was to explore the possibility of providing multifunctional oral insulin delivery system by conjugating several types of dipeptides on chitosan and trimethyl chitosan to be used as drug carriers. Conjugates of Glycyl-glycine and alanyl-alanine of chitosan and trimethyl chitosan (on primary alcohol group of polymer located on carbon 6) were synthesized and nanoparticles containing insulin were prepared for oral delivery. Preparation conditions of nanoparticles were optimized and their performance to enhance the permeability of insulin as well as cytotoxicity of nanoparticles in Caco-2 cell line was evaluated. To evaluate the efficacy of orally administered nanoparticles, nanoparticles with the most permeability enhancing ability were studied in male Wistar rats as animal model by measuring insulin and glucose Serum levels. Structural study of all the conjugates by infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance confirmed the successful formation of the conjugates with the desirable substitution degree. By optimizing preparation conditions, nanoparticles with expected size (157.3-197.7 nm), Zeta potential (24.35-34.37 mV), polydispersity index (0.365-0.512), entrapment efficiency (70.60-86.52%) and loading capacity (30.92-56.81%), proper morphology and desirable release pattern were obtained. Glycyl-glycine and alanyl-alanine conjugate nanoparticles of trimethyl chitosan showed 2.5-3.3 folds more effective insulin permeability in Caco-2 cell line than their chitosan counterparts. In animal model, oral administration of glycyl-glycine and alanyl-alanine conjugate nanoparticles of trimethyl chitosan demonstrated reasonable increase in Serum insulin level with relative bioavailability of 17.19% and 15.46% for glycyl-glycine and alanyl-alanine conjugate nanoparticles, respectively, and reduction in Serum glucose level compared with trimethyl chitosan nanoparticles (p < 0.05). It seems that glycyl-glycine and alanyl-alanine conjugate nanoparticles of trimethyl chitosan have met the aim of this research work and have been able to orally deliver insulin with more than one mechanism in animal model. Hence, they are promising candidates for further research studies. Endophytes are a rich source for structurally complex chemical scaffolds with interesting biological activities. Endophytes associated with Brugmansia aurea L. (family: Solanaceae), a medicinal plant, have not yet explored for the bioactive metabolites. Hence, Macrophomina phaseolina, a fungal endophyte, was isolated from the roots of the plant. Its methanolic extract was found active against human cancer cell lines with IC A novel di-peptide, serine-glycine-betaine isolated from M. phaseolina induced apoptosis in MIA-Pa-Ca-2 cells. This study confirms that dipeptides like serine-glycine-betaine and tyrosine-betaine might be specific to fungal genera, hence being used for diagnostic purposes.

6986.0	('Inosine', 'Hypoxanthosine', 'Ribonosine', 'Atorel', 'Oxiamin')	mouse	Inosine is a nucleoside that is formed when hypoxanthine is attached to a ribose ring (also known as a ribofuranose) via a β-N9-glycosidic bond. It was discovered in 1965 in analysis of RNA transferase. Inosine is commonly found in tRNAs and is essential for proper translation of the genetic code in wobble base pairs. Knowledge of inosine metabolism has led to advances in immunotherapy in recent decades. Inosine monophosphate is oxidised by the enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, yielding xanthosine monophosphate, a key precursor in purine metabolism. Mycophenolate mofetil is an anti-metabolite, anti-proliferative drug that acts as an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. It is used in the treatment of a variety of autoimmune diseases including granulomatosis with polyangiitis because the uptake of purine by actively dividing B cells can exceed 8 times that of normal body cells, and, therefore, this set of white cells (which cannot operate purine salvage pathways) is selectively targeted by the purine deficiency resulting from inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMD) inhibition. == Reactions == Adenine is converted to adenosine or inosine monophosphate (IMP), either of which, in turn, is converted into inosine (I), which pairs with adenine (A), cytosine (C), and uracil (U). Purine nucleoside phosphorylase intraconverts inosine and hypoxanthine. Inosine is also an intermediate in a chain of purine nucleotide reactions required for muscle movements. == Clinical significance == Subsequent studies in humans suggest that inosine supplementation has no effect on athletic performance. Animal studies have suggested that inosine has neuroprotective properties. It has been proposed for spinal cord injury and for administration after stroke, because observation suggests that inosine induces axonal rewiring. After ingestion, inosine is metabolized into uric acid, which has been suggested to be a natural antioxidant and peroxynitrite scavenger with potential benefits to patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Peroxynitrite has been correlated with axon degeneration In 2003, a study was initiated at the University of Pennsylvania MS Center to determine whether raising the levels of uric acid by the administration of inosine would slow the progression of MS. The study was completed in 2006 but the results were not reported to NIH. A subsequent publication hinted at potential benefits but the sample size (16 patients) was too small for a definitive conclusion. In addition, the side effect of the treatment was the development of kidney stones in four of 16 patients. With phase II trials for Parkinson's disease completed, inosine will continue to phase III trials. Earlier trials suggested that patients with the highest serum urate levels had slower progression of Parkinson's symptoms. The trial uses inosine to raise urate levels in those with levels lower than the population mean (6 mg/dL). Alseres Pharmaceuticals (named Boston Life Sciences when patent was granted) patented the use of inosine to treat stroke and was investigating the drug in the MS setting. In the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System, it is classified as an antiviral. == Binding == Inosine is a natural ligand for the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABA A receptor. == Biotechnology == When designing primers for polymerase chain reaction, inosine is useful in that it can pair with any natural base. This allows for design of primers that span a single-nucleotide polymorphism, without the polymorphism disrupting the primer's annealing efficiency. However, inosine pairs preferentially with cytosine (C) and its introduction to RNA, e.g. by the action of ADARs, thereby destabilizes double-stranded RNA by changing AU base-pairs to IU mismatches. == Fitness == Despite lack of clinical evidence that it improves muscle development, inosine remains an ingredient in some fitness supplements. == Feeding stimulant == Inosine has also been found to be an important feed stimulant by itself or in combination with certain amino acids in some species of farmed fish. For example, inosine and inosine 5-monophosphate have been reported as specific feeding stimulants for turbot fry, (Scophthalmus maximus) and Japanese amberjack, (Seriola quinqueradiata). The main problem of using inosine and/or inosine-5-monophosphate as feeding attractants is their high cost. However, their use may be economically justified within larval feeds for marine fish larvae during the early weaning period, since the total quantity of feed consumed is relatively small. == See also == Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase Inosine pranobex Nucleobase == References == == External links == PDR health study	Inosine	WIKIPEDIA	('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('END', -0.02552236244082451), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -9.088346359931165e-07), ('US', 0.0), (',', -1.8624639324116288e-06), (' MED', -0.22772590816020966), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.005247275810688734), (' FOOD', -0.35030803084373474), (',', -0.10026220977306366), (' PERSONAL', -0.0009513601544313133), (' CARE', 0.0)])
73492.0	('Nerolidol (natural)', 'Peruviol', 'Stirrup', '(z)-nerolidol', 'Nerolidol')	mouse	 Depression is a common global mental disorder that seriously harms human physical and mental health. With the development of society, the increase of pressure and the role of various other factors make the incidence of depression increase year by year. However, there is a lack of drugs that have a fast onset, significant effects, and few side effects. Some volatile oils from traditional natural herbal medicines are usually used to relieve depression and calm emotions, such as Lavender essential oil and Acorus tatarinowii essential oil. It was reported that these volatile oils, are easy to enter the brain through the blood-brain barrier and have good antidepressant effects with little toxicity and side effects. In this review, we summarized the classification of depression, and listed the history of using volatile oils to fight depression in some countries. Importantly, we summarized the anti-depressant natural volatile oils and their monomers from herbal medicine, discussed the anti-depressive mechanisms of the volatile oils from natural medicine. The volatile oils of natural medicine and antidepressant drugs were compared and analyzed, and the application of volatile oils was explained from the clinical use and administration routes. This review would be helpful for the development of potential anti-depressant medicine and provide new alternative treatments for depressive disorders. Internal organs fibrosis (IOF) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in most chronic inflammatory diseases, which is responsible for 45% of deaths due to disease. However, there is a paucity of drugs used to treat IOF, making it urgent to find medicine with good efficacy, low toxic side effects and good prognosis. Essential oils (EOs) extracted from natural herbs with a wide range of pharmacological components, multiple therapeutic targets, low toxicity, and broad sources have unique advantages and great potential in the treatment of IOF. In this review, we summarized EOs and their monomeric components with anti-IOF, and found that they work mainly through inhibiting TGF-β-related signaling pathways, modulating inflammatory cytokines, suppressing NF-κB, and anti-oxidative stress. The prognostic improvement of natural EOs on IOF was further discussed, as well as the quality and safety issues in the current development of natural EOs. This review hopes to provide scientific basis and new ideas for the development and application of natural medicine EOs in anti-IOF. The effect of structurally related sesquiterpenoids (E,E)-farnesol and cis-nerolidol on the host-plant selection behaviour of the peach potato aphid Myzus persicae (Sulz.) was evaluated using electrical penetration graph (EPG) technique. No repellent effects of (E,E)-farnesol and (Z)-nerolidol to M. persicae were found but aphid probing activities on (E,E)-farnesol- and cis-nerolidol-treated plants were restrained. During non-phloem phases of probing, neither (E,E)-farnesol nor (Z)-nerolidol affected the cell puncture activity. On (E,E)-farnesol-treated plants, the total duration of phloem phase, the mean duration of individual sustained ingestion periods were significantly lower, and the proportion of phloem salivation was higher than on control plants. On (Z)-nerolidol-treated plants, the occurrence of the first phloem phase was delayed, and the frequency of the phloem phase was lower than on control plants. The freely moving aphids were reluctant to remain on (E,E)-farnesol- and (Z)-nerolidol-treated leaves for at least 24 h after exposure. (E,E)-Farnesol and (Z)-nerolidol show complementary deterrent properties, (E,E)-farnesol showing ingestive and post-ingestive activities and nerolidol showing pre-ingestive, ingestive, and post-ingestive deterrent activities.

Furthermore, a targeted lipidomics analysis utilizing UHPLC-QQQ-MS/MS was developed to specifically assess the levels of lysophospholipids, including lysophosphocholine 16:0 (LPC 16:0), lysophosphoethanolamine 16:0 (LPE 16:0) and lysophosphoglycerol 16:0 (LPG 16:0), in RSV-infected mice compared to control mice. Animal experiments revealed that LPE 16:0, rather than LPC 16:0 or LPG 16:0, provided protection against RSV-induced weight loss, reduced lung viral load, regulated immune cells and mitigated lung injury in mice afflicted with RSV pneumonia. In summary, our findings suggested that the host responses to RSV infection pathology are closely with various lipid metabolic. Additionally, our results elucidated novel biological functions of LPE 16:0 and offering new avenues for drug development against RSV pneumonia.

88227.0	('Octadecylamine', 'Octadecan-1-amine', 'Octadecanamine', 'Stearylamine', 'Stearamine')	mouse	 We prepared super-hydrophobic nanocellulose films using a non-toxic octadecylamine/polydopamine system. Octadecylamine, a low surface energy material, was used to provide hydrophobic alkyl long chains. Polydopamine was produced by dopamine under alkaline conditions, creating an adhesive substance, which reinforced the hydrophobic long chains and increased the surface roughness of nanocellulose. The effects of reagent concentration, reaction temperature, and reaction time on hydrophobicity were then investigated. The results showed that with a 1:1 mass ratio of nanocellulose to octadecylamine, and reacting at 60 °C for 4 h, the contact angle of the obtained composite membrane reached 168.2°. Scanning electron microscope images revealed that the modified nanocellulose had a smaller particle size and more uniform distribution, which effectively improved the hydrophobicity of the nanocellulose. Thus, the green preparation of superhydrophobic films with high-temperature resistance and wear resistance was realized, which contributed to the high-value utilization of nanocellulose. A kind of heterogeneous catalyst, FeMn layered double hydroxide (Fe-Mn-LDH), was fabricated by coprecipitation process and used as PMS activator to degrade a novel organic pollutant octadecylamine (ODA). And the X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microcopy (TEM), Mapping and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) measurements were utilized to characterize the fresh and used Fe-Mn-LDH. After a serious of degradation experiments, it was clearly to see that the activator possessed excellent activation property for PMS and was capable of removing 85% ODA (10 mg·L In this research, a dispersive solid phase extraction procedure based on changing the solubility of octadecylamine with pH was proposed to determine Ag	Octadecylamine	PUBMED	('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.00020354038861114532), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])

62040.0	('Nortriptyline', 'Aventyl', 'Desitriptilina', 'Noramitriptyline', 'Lumbeck')	mouse	"Nortriptyline, sold under the brand name Aventyl, among others, is a tricyclic antidepressant. This medicine is also sometimes used for neuropathic pain, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), smoking cessation and anxiety. Its use for young people with depression and other psychiatric disorders may be limited due to increased suicidality in the 18–24 population initiating treatment. Nortriptyline is not a preferred treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or smoking cessation. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include dry mouth, constipation, blurry vision, sleepiness, low blood pressure with standing, and weakness. Serious side effects may include seizures, an increased risk of suicide in those less than 25 years of age, urinary retention, glaucoma, mania, and a number of heart issues. Nortriptyline may cause problems if taken during pregnancy. Use during breastfeeding appears to be relatively safe. It is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) and is believed to work by altering levels of serotonin and norepinephrine. Nortriptyline was approved for medical use in the United States in 1964. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 191st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Nortriptyline is used to treat depression. A level between 50 and 150 ng/mL of nortriptyline in the blood generally corresponds with an antidepressant effect. It is also used off-label for the treatment of panic disorder, ADHD, irritable bowel syndrome, tobacco-cessation, migraine prophylaxis and chronic pain or neuralgia modification, particularly temporomandibular joint disorder. === Irritable bowel syndrome === Nortriptyline has also been used as an off-label treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). == Contraindications == Nortriptyline should not be used in the acute recovery phase after myocardial infarction (heart attack). Use of tricyclic antidepressants along with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), linezolid, or IV methylene blue are contraindicated as it can cause an increased risk of developing serotonin syndrome. Closer monitoring is required for those with a history of cardiovascular disease, stroke, glaucoma, or seizures, as well as in persons with hyperthyroidism or receiving thyroid hormones. == Side effects == The most common side effects include dry mouth, sedation, constipation, increased appetite, blurred vision and tinnitus. An occasional side effect is a rapid or irregular heartbeat. Alcohol may exacerbate some of its side effects. == Overdose == The symptoms and the treatment of an overdose are generally the same as for the other tricyclic antidepressants, including anticholinergic effects, serotonin syndrome and adverse cardiac effects. TCAs, particularly nortriptyline, have a relatively narrow therapeutic index, which increase the chance of an overdose (both accidental and intentional). Symptoms of overdose include: irregular heartbeat, seizures, coma, confusion, hallucination, widened pupils, drowsiness, agitation, fever, low body temperature, stiff muscles and vomiting. == Interactions == Excessive consumption of alcohol in combination with nortriptyline therapy may have a potentiating effect, which may lead to the danger of increased suicidal attempts or overdosage, especially in patients with histories of emotional disturbances or suicidal ideation. It may interact with the following drugs: heart rhythm medications such as flecainide (Tambocor), propafenone (Rhythmol), or quinidine (Cardioquin, Quinidex, Quinaglute) cimetidine guanethidine reserpine == Pharmacology == Nortriptyline is a strong norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and a moderate serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Additionally, nortriptyline inhibits the activity of histamine and acetylcholine. Its pharmacologic profile is as the table shows with (inhibition or antagonism of all sites). === Pharmacodynamics === Nortriptyline is an active metabolite of amitriptyline by demethylation in the liver. Chemically, it is a secondary amine dibenzocycloheptene and pharmacologically it is classed as a first-generation antidepressant. Nortriptyline may also have a sleep-improving effect due to antagonism of the H1 and 5-HT2A receptors. In the short term, however, nortriptyline may disturb sleep due to its activating effect. In one study, nortriptyline had the highest affinity for the dopamine transporter among the tricyclic antidepressants (KD = 1,140 nM) besides amineptine (a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor), although its affinity for this transporter was still 261- and 63-fold lower than for the norepinephrine and serotonin transporters (KD = 4.37 and 18 nM, respectively). === Pharmacogenetics === Nortriptyline is metabolized in the liver by the hepatic enzyme CYP2D6, and genetic variations within the gene coding for this enzyme can affect its metabolism, leading to changes in the concentrations of the drug in the body. Increased concentrations of nortriptyline may increase the risk for side effects, including anticholinergic and nervous system adverse effects, while decreased concentrations may reduce the drug's efficacy. Individuals can be categorized into different types of CYP2D6 metabolizers depending on which genetic variations they carry. These metabolizer types include poor, intermediate, extensive, and ultrarapid metabolizers. Most individuals (about 77–92%) are extensive metabolizers, and have ""normal"" metabolism of nortriptyline. Poor and intermediate metabolizers have reduced metabolism of the drug as compared to extensive metabolizers; patients with these metabolizer types may have an increased probability of experiencing side effects. Ultrarapid metabolizers use nortriptyline much faster than extensive metabolizers; patients with this metabolizer type may have a greater chance of experiencing pharmacological failure. The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium recommends avoiding nortriptyline in persons who are CYP2D6 ultrarapid or poor metabolizers, due to the risk of a lack of efficacy and side effects, respectively. A reduction in starting dose is recommended for patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers. If use of nortriptyline is warranted, therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to guide dose adjustments. The Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group recommends reducing the dose of nortriptyline in CYP2D6 poor or intermediate metabolizers, and selecting an alternative drug or increasing the dose in ultrarapid metabolizers. == Chemistry == Nortriptyline is a tricyclic compound, specifically a dibenzocycloheptadiene, and possesses three rings fused together with a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzocycloheptadiene tricyclic antidepressants include amitriptyline (N-methylnortriptyline), protriptyline, and butriptyline. Nortriptyline is a secondary amine tricyclic antidepressant, with its N-methylated parent amitriptyline being a tertiary amine. Other secondary amine tricyclic antidepressants include desipramine and protriptyline. The chemical name of nortriptyline is 3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5-ylidene)-N-methyl-1-propanamine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C19H21N1 with a molecular weight of 263.384 g/mol. The drug is used commercially mostly as the hydrochloride salt; the free base form is used rarely. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 72-69-5 and of the hydrochloride is 894-71-3. == History == Nortriptyline was developed by Geigy. It first appeared in the literature in 1962 and was patented the same year. The drug was first introduced for the treatment of depression in 1963. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Nortriptyline is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, while nortriptyline hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Its generic name in Spanish and Italian and its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana are nortriptilina, in German is nortriptylin, and in Latin is nortriptylinum. === Brand names === Brand names of nortriptyline include Allegron, Aventyl, Noritren, Norpress, Nortrilen, Norventyl, Norzepine, Pamelor, and Sensival, among many others. == Research == Although not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for neuropathic pain, randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of tricyclic antidepressants for the treatment of this condition in both depressed and non-depressed individuals. In 2010, an evidence-based guideline sponsored by the International Association for the Study of Pain recommended nortriptyline as a first-line medication for neuropathic pain. However, in a 2015 Cochrane systematic review the authors did not recommend nortriptyline as a first-line agent for neuropathic pain. It may be effective in the treatment of tobacco-cessation. == References =="	Nortriptyline	WIKIPEDIA	('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])
12057.0	('Thymidine', 'Deoxythymidine', 'Thymidin', 'Beta-thymidine', 'Dthyd')	mouse	"Thymidine (symbol dT or dThd), also known as deoxythymidine, deoxyribosylthymine, or thymine deoxyriboside, is a pyrimidine deoxynucleoside. Deoxythymidine is the DNA nucleoside T, which pairs with deoxyadenosine (A) in double-stranded DNA. In cell biology it is used to synchronize the cells in G1/early S phase. The prefix deoxy- is often left out since there are no precursors of thymine nucleotides involved in RNA synthesis. Before the boom in thymidine use caused by the need for thymidine in the production of the antiretroviral drug azidothymidine (AZT), much of the world's thymidine production came from herring sperm. Thymidine occurs almost exclusively in DNA but it also occurs in the T-loop of tRNA. == Structure and properties == In its composition, deoxythymidine is a nucleoside composed of deoxyribose (a pentose sugar) joined to the pyrimidine base thymine. Deoxythymidine can be phosphorylated with one, two or three phosphoric acid groups, creating dTMP (deoxythymidine monophosphate), dTDP, or dTTP (for the di- and tri- phosphates, respectively). It exists in solid form as small white crystals or white crystalline powder. It has a molecular weight of 242.229 Da and a melting point of 185 °C. The stability of deoxythymidine under standard temperature and pressure (STP) is very high. Deoxythymidine is non-toxic and is part of one of the four nucleosides in DNA. It is a naturally occurring compound that exists in all living organisms and DNA viruses. Instead of thymidine, RNA contains uridine (uracil joined to ribose). Uracil is chemically very similar to thymine, which is also known as 5-methyluracil. Since thymine nucleotides are precursors of DNA (but not RNA), the prefix ""deoxy"" is often left out, i.e., deoxythymidine is often just called thymidine. Thymidine is listed as a chemical teratogen. == Modified analogs == Iododeoxyuridine is a radiosensitizer and increases the amount of DNA damage received from ionizing radiation. Azidothymidine (AZT) – used in the treatment of HIV infection. AZT inhibits the process of reverse transcription, a critical step in the viral life cycle. Radiolabeled thymidine (TdR), such as tritiated thymidine (3H-TdR), is commonly used in cell proliferation assays. The thymidine is incorporated into dividing cells and the level of this incorporation, measured using a liquid scintillation counter, is proportional to the amount of cell proliferation. For example, lymphocyte proliferation can be measured this way in lymphoproliferative disorders. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) is another thymidine analog that is often used for the detection of proliferating cells in living tissues. 5-Ethynyl-2´-deoxyuridine (EdU) is a thymidine analog which is incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells and is used to assay DNA synthesis in cell culture or living tissues. It can be visualized by covalently binding a fluorescent azide using click chemistry, which is less harsh than the conditions used to expose the epitope for BrdU antibodies. Edoxudine is an antiviral drug. Telbivudine (β-L-2′-deoxythymidine, LdT) is the unmodified ""unnatural"" L-enantiomer of thymidine that was used in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. == Thymidine imbalance induces mutation and recombination == During growth of bacteriophage T4, an excess of thymidine availability increases mutation. A deficiency of thymidine during growth also increases mutation. A thymidylate auxotroph of the diploid yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was grown under conditions in which thymidyate levels varied from excess to depletion. High levels of thymidylate were observed to be mutagenic and recombinogenic, whereas starvation for thymidylate was recombinogenic but only slightly mutagenic. == References == == External links == http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1990/11/05/74308/index.htm"	Thymidine	WIKIPEDIA	('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.001573663903400302), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.8624639324116288e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.2014317512512207), (' MED', -0.29889005422592163), ('ICAL', 0.0)])
74669.0	('Tamoxifen', 'Trans-tamoxifen', 'Crisafeno', 'Diemon', 'Tamoxifene')	mouse	"Tamoxifen, sold under the brand name Nolvadex among others, is a selective estrogen receptor modulator used to prevent breast cancer in women and men. It is also being studied for other types of cancer. It has been used for Albright syndrome. Tamoxifen is typically taken daily by mouth for five years for breast cancer. Serious side effects include a small increased risk of uterine cancer, stroke, vision problems, and pulmonary embolism. Common side effects include irregular periods, weight loss, and hot flashes. It may cause harm to the baby if taken during pregnancy or breastfeeding. It is a selective estrogen-receptor modulator (SERM) and works by decreasing the growth of breast cancer cells. It is a member of the triphenylethylene group of compounds. Tamoxifen was initially made in 1962, by chemist Dora Richardson. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Tamoxifen is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 317th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 900 thousand prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Dysmenorrhea === Dysmenorrhea is the term for menstrual pain, usually centered in the lower abdomen but often spreading to the back and inner thighs. It is a common gynecological condition that can seriously affect daily activities and well-being. Tamoxifen has been identified and used to effectively improve blood flow, reduce uterine contractility and pain in dysmenorrhea patients. === Breast cancer === Tamoxifen is used for the treatment of both early and advanced estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive or ER+) breast cancer in pre- and postmenopausal women. Tamoxifen increases the risk of postmenopausal bleeding, endometrial polyps, hyperplasia, and endometrial cancer; using tamoxifen with an intrauterine system releasing levonorgestrel might increase vaginal bleeding after 1 to 2 years, but reduces somewhat endometrial polyps and hyperplasia, but not necessarily endometrial cancer. Additionally, it is the most common hormone treatment for male breast cancer. It is also approved by the FDA for the prevention of breast cancer in women at high risk of developing the disease. The effectiveness of tamoxifen is primarily influenced by estrogen receptor (ER) status, which was the key predictor of the proportional benefits observed. It has been further approved for the reduction of contralateral (in the opposite breast) cancer. Five years of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment significantly lowers the 15-year risk of breast cancer recurrence and mortality. The overall use of tamoxifen is recommended for 10 years. In 2006, the large STAR clinical study concluded that raloxifene is also effective in reducing the incidence of breast cancer. Updated results after an average of 6.75 years of follow up found that raloxifene retains 76% of tamoxifen's effectiveness in preventing invasive breast cancer, with 45% fewer uterine cancers and 25% fewer blood clots in women taking raloxifene than in women taking tamoxifen. === Infertility === Tamoxifen is used for ovulation induction to treat infertility in women with anovulatory disorders. It is given at days three to seven of a woman's cycle. Tamoxifen improves fertility in males with infertility by disinhibiting the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis) via ER antagonism and thereby increasing the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and increasing testicular testosterone production. Some animal studies have suggested tamoxifen could have negative effects on sperm quality and prostatic and gonadal health. === Gynecomastia === Benign enlargement of the male breast, whether asymptomatic or painful, is a common condition thought to result from an increased estrogen/testosterone ratio or from heightened estrogenic or reduced androgenic activity via receptor interactions.Tamoxifen is used to prevent and treat gynecomastia. It is taken as a preventative measure in small doses, or used at the onset of any symptoms such as nipple soreness or sensitivity. Current treatments typically involve pain relief through medication or surgery. However, targeting the underlying estrogenic stimulation may offer a more specific therapeutic approach. In a double-blind crossover study, patients were given either a placebo or tamoxifen (10 mg orally twice daily) for one month, in random order. Seven out of ten patients saw a reduction in gynecomastia size with tamoxifen (P < 0.005), and the overall reduction for the group was statistically significant (P < 0.01). No benefits were observed with the placebo (P > 0.1). Additionally, all four patients with painful gynecomastia experienced relief of their symptoms, and no toxicity was noted. Although the breast size reduction was partial, this suggests that longer treatment may be necessary. Follow-up examinations conducted 9 to 12 months after treatment revealed no significant changes, except in two cases: one tamoxifen responder had a recurrence of breast tenderness after six months, and one non-responder developed increased breast size and new tenderness after ten months. Other medications are taken for similar purposes such as clomifene and aromatase inhibitor drugs; which are used in order to try to avoid the hormone-related adverse effects. Overall, tamoxifen appears to be a safe and effective treatment option for selected cases of gynecomastia. === Early puberty === Tamoxifen is useful in the treatment of peripheral precocious puberty, for instance due to McCune–Albright syndrome, in both girls and boys. It has been found to decrease growth velocity and the rate of bone maturation in girls with precocious puberty, and hence to improve final height in these individuals. === Available forms === Tamoxifen is available as a tablet or oral solution. == Contraindications == Tamoxifen has a number of contraindications, including known hypersensitivity to tamoxifen or other ingredients, individuals taking concomitant coumarin-type anticoagulant therapy, and women with a history of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism). == Side effects == A report in September 2009 from Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality suggests that tamoxifen, raloxifene, and tibolone used to treat breast cancer significantly reduce invasive breast cancer in midlife and older women, but also increase the risk of adverse side effects. === Endometrial cancer === Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Even though it is an antagonist in breast tissue it acts as partial agonist on the endometrium and has been linked to endometrial cancer in some women. Therefore, endometrial changes, including cancer, are among tamoxifen's side effects. With time, risk of endometrial cancer may be doubled to quadrupled, which is a reason tamoxifen is typically only used for five years. The American Cancer Society lists tamoxifen as a known carcinogen, stating that it increases the risk of some types of uterine cancer while lowering the risk of breast cancer recurrence. === Cardiovascular and metabolic === Tamoxifen treatment of postmenopausal women is associated with beneficial effects on serum lipid profiles. However, long-term data from clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a cardioprotective effect. For some women, tamoxifen can cause a rapid increase in triglyceride concentration in the blood. In addition, there is an increased risk of thromboembolism especially during and immediately after major surgery or periods of immobility. Use of tamoxifen has been shown to slightly increase risk of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke. === Liver toxicity === Tamoxifen has been associated with a number of cases of hepatotoxicity. Several different varieties of hepatotoxicity have been reported. Tamoxifen can also precipitate non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in obese and overweight women (not in normal weight women) at an average rate of 40% after a year use with 20 mg/day. == Overdose == Acute overdose of tamoxifen has not been reported in humans. In dose-ranging studies, tamoxifen was administered at very high doses in women (e.g., 300 mg/m2) and was found to produce acute neurotoxicity including tremor, hyperreflexia, unsteady gait, and dizziness. These symptoms occurred within three to five days of therapy and disappeared within two to five days of discontinuation of therapy. No indications of permanent neurotoxicity were observed. QT prolongation was also observed with very high doses of tamoxifen. There is no specific antidote for overdose of tamoxifen. Instead, treatment should be based on symptoms. == Interactions == Patients with variant forms of the gene CYP2D6 may not receive full benefit from tamoxifen because of too slow metabolism of the tamoxifen prodrug into its active metabolites. On 18 October 2006, the Subcommittee for Clinical Pharmacology recommended relabeling tamoxifen to include information about this gene in the package insert. Certain CYP2D6 variations in breast cancer patients lead to a worse clinical outcome for tamoxifen treatment. Genotyping therefore has the potential for identification of women who have these CYP2D6 phenotypes and for whom the use of tamoxifen is associated with poor outcomes. Recent research has shown that 7–10% of women with breast cancer may not receive the full medical benefit from taking tamoxifen due to their genetic make-up. DNA Drug Safety Testing can examine DNA variations in the CYP2D6 and other important drug processing pathways. More than 20% of all clinically used medications are metabolized by CYP2D6 and knowing the CYP2D6 status of a person can help the doctor with the future selection of medications. Other molecular biomarkers may also be used to select appropriate patients likely to benefit from tamoxifen. Recent studies suggest that taking the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) antidepressants paroxetine (Paxil), fluoxetine (Prozac), and sertraline (Zoloft) can decrease the effectiveness of tamoxifen, as these drugs compete for the CYP2D6 enzyme which is needed to metabolize tamoxifen into its active forms. A U.S. study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting in 2009 found that after two years, 7.5% of women who took only tamoxifen had a recurrence, compared with 16% who took either paroxetine, fluoxetine or sertraline, drugs considered to be the most potent CYP2D6 inhibitors. That difference translates to a 120% increase in the risk of breast cancer recurrence. Patients taking the SSRIs Celexa (citalopram), Lexapro (escitalopram), and Luvox (fluvoxamine) did not have an increased risk of recurrence, due to their lack of competitive metabolism for the CYP2D6 enzyme. A newer study demonstrated a clearer and stronger effect from paroxetine in causing the worst outcomes. Patients treated with both paroxetine and tamoxifen have a 67% increased risk of death from breast cancer, from 24% to 91%, depending on the duration of coadministration. Tamoxifen interacts with certain other antiestrogens. The aromatase inhibitor aminoglutethimide induces the metabolism of tamoxifen. Conversely, the aromatase inhibitor letrozole does not affect the metabolism of tamoxifen. However, tamoxifen induces the metabolism of letrozole and significantly reduces its concentrations. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Selective estrogen receptor modulator activity ==== Tamoxifen acts as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), or as a partial agonist of the estrogen receptors (ERs). It has mixed estrogenic and antiestrogenic activity, with its profile of effects differing by tissue. For instance, tamoxifen has predominantly antiestrogenic effects in the breasts but predominantly estrogenic effects in the uterus and liver. In breast tissue, tamoxifen acts as an ER antagonist so that transcription of estrogen-responsive genes is inhibited. A beneficial side effect of tamoxifen is that it prevents bone loss by acting as an ER agonist (i.e., mimicking the effects of estrogen) in this cell type. Therefore, by inhibiting osteoclasts, it prevents osteoporosis. When tamoxifen was launched as a drug, it was thought that tamoxifen would act as an ER antagonist in all tissues, including bone, and therefore it was feared that it would contribute to osteoporosis. It was therefore very surprising that the opposite effect was observed clinically. Hence tamoxifen's tissue selective action directly led to the formulation of the concept of SERMs. Tamoxifen is a long-acting SERM, with a nuclear retention of the ER–tamoxifen (or metabolite) complex of greater than 48 hours. It has relatively little affinity for the ERs itself and instead acts as a prodrug of active metabolites such as endoxifen (4-hydroxy-N-desmethyltamoxifen) and afimoxifene (4-hydroxytamoxifen; 4-OHT). These metabolites have approximately 30 to 100 times greater affinity for the ERs than tamoxifen itself. Per one study, tamoxifen had 7% and 6% of the affinity of estradiol for the ERα and ERβ, respectively, whereas afimoxifene had 178% and 338% of the affinity of estradiol for the ERα and ERβ, respectively. Hence, afimoxifene showed 25-fold higher affinity for the ERα and 56-fold higher affinity for the ERβ than tamoxifen. The antiestrogenic potencies of endoxifen and afimoxifene are very similar. However, endoxifen occurs in much higher concentrations than afimoxifene and is now thought to be the major active form of tamoxifen in the body. Tamoxifen binds to ER competitively (with respect to the endogenous agonist estrogen) in tumor cells and other tissue targets, producing a nuclear complex that decreases DNA synthesis and inhibits estrogen effects. It is a nonsteroidal agent with potent antiestrogenic properties which compete with estrogen for binding sites in breast and other tissues. Tamoxifen causes cells to remain in the G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle. Because it prevents (pre)cancerous cells from dividing but does not cause cell death, tamoxifen is cytostatic rather than cytocidal. Tamoxifen binds to ER, the ER/tamoxifen complex recruits other proteins known as co-repressors, and the complex then binds to DNA to modulate gene expression. Some of these proteins include NCoR and SMRT. Tamoxifen function can be regulated by a number of different variables including growth factors. Tamoxifen needs to block growth factor proteins such as ErbB2/HER2 because high levels of ErbB2 have been shown to occur in tamoxifen resistant cancers. Tamoxifen seems to require a protein PAX2 for its full anticancer effect. In the presence of high PAX2 expression, the tamoxifen/ER complex is able to suppress the expression of the pro-proliferative ERBB2 protein. In contrast, when AIB-1 expression is higher than PAX2, tamoxifen/ER complex upregulates the expression of ERBB2 resulting in stimulation of breast cancer growth. Tamoxifen is antigonadotropic in postmenopausal women and partially suppresses levels of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in such women. However, it has progonadotropic effects in premenopausal women and increases estrogen levels by 6-fold in them. Due to the nature of tamoxifen as a competitive ER ligand, this increase in estrogen levels is liable to interfere with the antiestrogenic efficacy of tamoxifen. The effects of tamoxifen on breast cancer Ki-67 expression, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, and IGF-1 levels are dose-dependent across a dosage range of 1 to 20 mg/day in women with breast cancer. Tamoxifen has been found to decrease insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels by 17 to 38% in women and men. Suppression of IGF-1 production in the liver is a well-known action of estrogens and SERMs. A 10 mg/day dosage of tamoxifen is nearly as effective as a 20 mg/day dosage in suppressing IGF-1 levels. ==== Other activities ==== Afimoxifene is an agonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) with relatively low affinity. Its affinity for the receptor is in the range of 100 to 1,000 nM, relative to 3 to 6 nM for estradiol. In addition to its activity as a SERM, afimoxifene binds to both the estrogen-related receptor β and estrogen-related receptor γ and is an antagonist of the estrogen-related receptor γ (ERRγ). Norendoxifen (4-hydroxy-N,N-didesmethyltamoxifen), another active metabolite of tamoxifen, has been found to act as a potent competitive aromatase inhibitor (IC50 = 90 nM), and may also be involved in the antiestrogenic activity of tamoxifen. In addition to its activity as a SERM, tamoxifen is a potent and selective protein kinase C inhibitor, and is active in this regard at therapeutic concentrations. This action is thought to underlie the efficacy of tamoxifen in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Tamoxifen is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. In 2018, it was discovered that tamoxifen directly interacts with the dopamine transporter (DAT) and acts as an atypical dopamine reuptake inhibitor (DRI). It has weak potency (54% inhibition of dopamine uptake at 10 μM) and lacks any stimulant or depressant effects when administered by itself. However, tamoxifen dose-dependently blocks amphetamine-mediated dopamine release and psychostimulant-like effects in animals. This unusual profile of DRI activity has made tamoxifen of potential interest as a starting point for structural modification to develop novel pharmaceutical drugs for treatment of stimulant use disorder. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Tamoxifen is rapidly and extensively absorbed from the intestines with oral administration. The oral bioavailability of tamoxifen is approximately 100%, which is suggestive of minimal first-pass metabolism in the intestines and liver. Following intake, peak levels of tamoxifen occur after three to seven hours. Steady state levels of tamoxifen are reached typically after 3 to 4 weeks but possibly up to 16 weeks of daily administration. Steady state levels of afimoxifene are achieved after 8 weeks of daily tamoxifen administration. Peak levels of tamoxifen after a single 40 mg oral dose were 65 ng/mL and steady state levels at 20 mg/day were 310 ng/mL. Levels of tamoxifen show clear dose dependency across a dosage range of 1 to 20 mg/day. Endoxifen levels are approximately 5 to 10 times higher than afimoxifene levels, with large interindividual variability. Endoxifen levels have been reported as 10.8 to 15.9 ng/mL at steady state in CYP2D6 normal metabolizers during therapy with 20 mg/day tamoxifen. The most abundant metabolites of tamoxifen in terms of circulating concentrations are N-desmethyltamoxifen, N,N-didesmethyltamoxifen, (Z)-endoxifen, and tamoxifen N-oxide. ==== Distribution ==== The volume of distribution of tamoxifen is 50 to 60 L/kg and its clearance has been estimated as 1.2 to 5.1 L/hour. High concentrations of tamoxifen have been found in breast, uterus, liver, kidney, lung, pancreas, and ovary tissue in animals and humans. Levels of tamoxifen in the uterus have been found to be 2- to 3-fold higher than in the circulation and in the breasts 10-fold higher than in the circulation. The plasma protein binding of tamoxifen and afimoxifene is greater than 99%. A majority of tamoxifen is bound to albumin. Albumin alone binds 98.8% of tamoxifen while other plasma proteins are not greatly involved. ==== Metabolism ==== Tamoxifen is a prodrug and is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 into active metabolites such as endoxifen (4-hydroxy-N-desmethyltamoxifen) and afimoxifene (4-hydroxytamoxifen). Conversion of tamoxifen by N-demethylation into N-desmethyltamoxifen, which is catalyzed primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, is responsible for approximately 92% of tamoxifen metabolism. Conversely, 4-hydroxylation of tamoxifen into afimoxifene is responsible for only about 7% of tamoxifen metabolism. Following its formation, N-desmethyltamoxifen is oxidized into several other metabolites, the most notable of which is endoxifen. Another active metabolite, norendoxifen (4-hydroxy-N,N-didesmethyltamoxifen), is formed via N-demethylation of endoxifen or 4-hydroxylation of N,N-didesmethyltamoxifen. Tamoxifen and its metabolites undergo conjugation, including glucuronidation and sulfation. Tamoxifen may inhibit its own metabolism. ==== Elimination ==== Tamoxifen has a long elimination half-life of typically 5 to 7 days, with a range of 4 to 11 days. Similarly, the half-life of afimoxifene is 14 days. Conversely, the half-life of endoxifen is 50 to 70 hours (2–3 days). The long half-lives of tamoxifen and afimoxifene are attributed to their high plasma protein binding as well as to enterohepatic recirculation. Upon discontinuation of treatment, levels of tamoxifen and its metabolites persist in the circulation for at least 6 weeks. Tamoxifen is excreted in bile and is eliminated in feces, while small amounts are eliminated in urine. == Chemistry == Tamoxifen is a nonsteroidal SERM of the triphenylethylene family and was structurally derived from diethylstilbestrol-like estrogens and antiestrogens such as chlorotrianisene and ethamoxytriphetol. Initially, clomifene was synthesized, and tamoxifen was developed subsequently. Tamoxifen is closely related structurally to other triphenylethylenes, such as clomifene, nafoxidine, ospemifene, toremifene, and numerous others. Other SERMs, like raloxifene, are structurally distinct from tamoxifen and other triphenylethylenes. == History == In the late 1950s, pharmaceutical companies were actively researching a newly discovered class of anti-estrogen compounds in the hope of developing a morning-after contraceptive pill. Arthur L Walpole was a reproductive endocrinologist who led such a team at the Alderley Park research laboratories of ICI Pharmaceuticals. It was there in 1962 that chemist Dora Richardson first synthesized tamoxifen, back then known as ICI-46,474, when she was looking to create triphenylethylene derivatives for the contraceptive pill project that her team was researching. This compound was originally created to work as an estrogen inhibitor, but instead was found to stimulate ovulation in participants of the drug testing trial. Walpole and his colleagues filed a UK patent covering this compound in 1962, but patent protection on this compound was repeatedly denied in the US until the 1980s. Tamoxifen did eventually receive marketing approval as a fertility treatment, but the class of compounds never proved useful in human contraception. A link between estrogen and breast cancer had been known for many years, but cancer treatments were not a corporate priority at the time, and Walpole's personal interests were important in keeping support for the compound alive in the face of this and the lack of patent protection. It was only when Walpole threatened to leave his position that corporate decided to allow trials and testing for tamoxifen as a drug that could be used to treat breast cancer. Without Walpole's effort towards defending the work that his team had done in discovering a possibly revolutionary source for breast cancer treatment, tamoxifen could have become a discarded or under-researched idea. Walpole's team consisted of Dora Richardson and G. A. Snow, who worked on the chemistry portion of the project, along with G. E. Paget and J. K. Walley, who focused primarily on the biological side. Tamoxifen is one of three drugs in an anti-angiogenetic protocol developed by Dr. Judah Folkman, a researcher at Children's Hospital at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Folkman discovered in the 1970s that angiogenesis – the growth of new blood vessels – plays a significant role in the development of cancer. Since his discovery, an entirely new field of cancer research has developed. Clinical trials on angiogenesis inhibitors have been underway since 1992 using many different drugs. The Harvard researchers developed a specific protocol for a golden retriever named Navy who was cancer-free after receiving the prescribed cocktail of celecoxib, doxycycline, and tamoxifen – the treatment subsequently became known as the Navy Protocol. Furthermore, tamoxifen treatment alone has been shown to have anti-angiogenetic effects in animal models of cancer which appear to be, at least in part, independent of tamoxifen's ER antagonist properties. Other antiestrogens, such as ethamoxytriphetol (MER-25) and clomifene (MRL-41), were assessed for treatment of breast cancer and found to be effective before tamoxifen, but were plagued with toxicity issues. The first clinical study of tamoxifen took place at the Christie Hospital in 1971, and showed a convincing effect in advanced breast cancer, but nevertheless ICI's development programme came close to termination when it was reviewed in 1972. In an unpublished article from the early days of the trial, Dora Richardson documented her team's excitement about tamoxifen's effects in counteracting infertility problems and the early positive effects found in breast cancer patients. Unfortunately, this work was not well received by everyone, as the team was supposed to be looking for a contraceptive pill. Tamoxifen's further development may have been bolstered by a second clinical study by Harold W.C. Ward at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. Ward's study showed a more definitive response to the drug at a higher dosage. Walpole also may have helped to convince the company to market tamoxifen for late stage breast cancer in 1973. He was also instrumental in funding V. Craig Jordan to work on tamoxifen. In 1972, ICI Pharmaceuticals Division abandoned development of tamoxifen for financial reasons. The drug was subsequently reinvented from a failed contraceptive, to become tamoxifen, the gold standard for the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer and the pioneering medicine for chemprevention for high-risk women. Two books, Estrogen Action, Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators and Women's Health (Imperial College Press 2013) and Tamoxifen: Pioneering Medicine in Breast Cancer (Springer 2013) tell this story. 1980 saw the publication of the first trial to show that tamoxifen given in addition to chemotherapy improved survival for patients with early breast cancer. In advanced disease, tamoxifen is now only recognized as effective in ER+ patients, but the early trials did not select ER+ patients, and by the mid-1980s the clinical trial picture was not showing a major advantage for tamoxifen. Nevertheless, tamoxifen had a relatively mild side-effect profile, and a number of large trials continued. The pharmacology of SERMs was discovered, defined, and deciphered during the 1980s. A clinical strategy was described that led to the creation of SERMs as a group of multifunctional medicines aimed at the treatment or prevention of many conditions in postmenopausal women, e.g. osteoporosis and breast cancer. The early sales of tamoxifen in both the UK and in the U.S. far exceeded ICI's original estimate, but despite this, at the annual portfolio review ICI's board members still asserted that ""there was no market for cancer"", leaving the drug's marketing success to rely on its clinical results and clinicians' and scientists' interests in it. Shortly after, Dora Richardson published a history of tamoxifen that, unusually for that type of paper, included personal accounts and letters from patients who attributed their healing to the drug. This testimony from cancer patients using tamoxifen helped to shape and push forward research, by justifying it both morally and scientifically to corporations. It was not until 1998 that the meta-analysis of the Oxford-based Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group showed definitively that tamoxifen was effective for early breast cancer. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Tamoxifen is marketed under the brand names Nolvadex and Soltamox, and a variety of other brand names throughout the world. === Economics === Global sales of tamoxifen in 2001 were approximately $1.02 billion. Since the expiration of the patent in 2002, it is widely available as a generic drug around the world. As of 2004, tamoxifen was the world's largest selling hormonal drug for the treatment of breast cancer. == Research == In McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) tamoxifen has been used to treat premature puberty and the consequences of premature puberty. Tamoxifen has been seen to decrease rapid bone maturation which is the result of excessive estrogen and alter predicted adult height (PAH). The same effects have also been seen in short pubertal boys. However, one in vitro study in 2007 and later an in vivo study in 2008 have shown that tamoxifen induces apoptosis in growth plate chondrocytes, reduces serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels and causes persistent retardation of longitudinal and cortical radial bone growth in young male rats, leading the researchers to express concern giving tamoxifen to growing individuals. Tamoxifen has been studied in the treatment of the rare conditions of retroperitoneal fibrosis and idiopathic sclerosing mesenteritis. It has also been proposed as part of a treatment plan for Riedel's thyroiditis. Tamoxifen is used as a research tool to trigger tissue-specific gene expression in many conditional expression constructs in genetically modified animals including a version of the Cre-Lox recombination technique. While widely used in transgenic research, the strong anabolic effect of tamoxifen on bone might confound this approach, especially as it relates to bone-targeted constructs. Tamoxifen may be effective in the treatment of mania in people with bipolar disorder. This is thought to be due to blockade of protein kinase C (PKC), an enzyme that regulates neuron activity in the brain. Researchers believe PKC is overactive during the mania in bipolar patients. As of September 2019, endoxifen, a major active metabolite of tamoxifen with a 4-fold more potent PKC inhibition, was in phase III clinical trials for bipolar disorder. == References == == Further reading == Dean L (2014).

In this study, we performed 16S rDNA sequencing and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based nontargeted metabolomic profiling on feces of 26 untreated RA patients and 26 healthy controls. Twenty-six genera and forty-one MS2-identified metabolites were significantly altered in the RA patients.  Myocardial infarction (MI) is a serious cardiovascular disease, which presents different pathophysiological changes with the prolongation of the disease. Compound danshen dripping pills (CDDP) has obvious advantages in MI treatment and widely used in the clinic. However, the current studies were mostly focused on the endpoint of CDDP intervention, lacking the dynamic attention to the disease process. It is of great value to establish a dynamic research strategy focused on the changes in pharmacodynamic substances for guiding clinical medication more precisely. It is aimed to explore the dynamic regulating pattern of CDDP on MI based on metabolic trajectory analysis, and then clarify the variation characteristic biomarkers and pharmacodynamic substances in the intervention process. The MI model was successfully prepared by coronary artery left anterior descending branch ligation, and then CDDP intervention was given for 28 days. Endogenous metabolites and the components of CDDP in serum were measured by LC/MS technique simultaneously to identify dynamic the metabolic trajectory and screen the characteristic pharmacodynamic substances at different points. Finally, network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques were used to simulate the core pharmacodynamic substances and core target binding, then validated at the genetic and protein level by Q-PCR and western blotting technology. CDDP performed typical dynamic regulation features on metabolite distribution, biological processes, and pharmacodynamic substances. During 1-7 days, it mainly regulated lipid metabolism and inflammation, the Phosphatidylcholine (PC(18:1(9Z/18:1(9Z)) and Sphingomyelin (SM(d18:1/23:1(9Z)), SM(d18:1/24:1(15Z)), SM(d18:0/16:1(9Z))) were the main characteristic biomarkers. Lipid metabolism was the mainly regulation pathway during 14-21 days, and the characteristic biomarkers were the Lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LysoPE(0:0/20:0), PE-NMe2(22:1(13Z)/15:0)) and Sphingomyelin (SM(d18:1/23:1(9Z))). At 28 days, in addition to inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism also played the most important role. Correspondingly, Lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC(20:0/0:0)), Lysophosphatidylserine (LPS(18:0/0:0)) and Fatty acids (Linoelaidic acid) were the characteristic biomarkers. Based on the results of metabolite distribution and biological process, the characteristic pharmacodynamic substances during the intervention were further identified. The results showed that various kinds of Saponins and Tanshinones as the important active ingredients performed a long-range regulating effect on MI. And the other components, such as Tanshinol and Salvianolic acid B affected Phosphatidylcholine and Sphingomyelin through Relaxin Signaling pathway during the early intervention. Protocatechualdehyde and Rosmarinic acid affected Lysophosphatidylethanolamine and Sphingomyelin through EGFR Tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance during the late intervention. Tanshinone IIB and Isocryptotanshinone via PPAR signaling pathway affected Lysophosphatidylcholine, Lysophosphatidylserine, and Fatty acids. The dynamic regulating pattern was taken as the entry point and constructs the dynamic network based on metabolic trajectory analysis, establishes the dynamic correlation between the drug-derived components and the endogenous metabolites, and elucidates the characteristic biomarkers affecting the changes of the pharmacodynamic indexes, systematically and deeply elucidate the pharmacodynamic substance and mechanism of CDDP on MI. It also enriched the understanding of CDDP and provided a methodological reference for the dynamic analysis of complex systems of TCM. Background: To improve the grade of beef marbling has great economic value in the cattle industry since marbling has the traits of high quality and comprehensive nutrition. And because of the marbling’s importance and complexity, it is indispensable to explore marbled beef at multiple levels. This experiment studied the relationship between fecal metabolites and marbling characters, and further screened biomarkers. Results: We performed fecal metabolomics analysis on 30 individuals selected from 100 crossbreed cattle (Luxi Yellow cattle ♀ × Japanese Wagyu cattle ♂), 15 with an extremely high-grade marbling beef and 15 with an extremely low-grade marbling beef. A total of 9959 and 8389 m/z features were detected in positive ionization and negative ionization mode by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Unfortunately, the sample separation in the PCA is not obvious, and the predictive ability of the orthogonal partial least squares discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA) model is not good. However, we got six differential metabolites filtered by VIP > 1 and p < 0.05. After that, we used weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and found out a module in each positive and negative mode most related to the trait of marbling beef, and then identified three metabolites in positive mode. By further annotation of the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG), it was found that these metabolites involved a variety of metabolic ways, including sphingomyelin metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and so on. Finally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the predictability of metabolites, and the result showed that SM(d18:0/16:1(9Z)) (AUC = 0.72), PC(15:0/18:2(9Z,12Z)) (AUC = 0.72), ADP (AUC = 0.71), PC(16:0/16:0) (AUC = 0.73), and 3-O-Sulfogalactosylceramide (d18:1/18:0) (AUC = 0.69) have an accuracy diagnosis. Conclusions: In conclusion, this study supports new opinions for the successive evaluation of marbling beef through metabolites. Furthermore, six non-invasive fecal metabolites that can evaluate beef marbling grade were found, including SM(d18:0/16:1(9Z)), PC(15:0/18:2(9Z,12Z)), ADP, PC(16:0/16:0), and 3-O-Sulfogalactosylceramide.

We evaluated the safety and efficacy of  In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, we randomly assigned patients 4 years of age or older with genetically confirmed Niemann-Pick disease type C in a 1:1 ratio to receive NALL for 12 weeks, followed by placebo for 12 weeks, or to receive placebo for 12 weeks, followed by NALL for 12 weeks. NALL or matching placebo was administered orally two to three times per day, with patients 4 to 12 years of age receiving weight-based doses (2 to 4 g per day) and those 13 years of age or older receiving a dose of 4 g per day. The primary end point was the total score on the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA; range, 0 to 40, with lower scores indicating better neurologic status). Secondary end points included scores on the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement, the Spinocerebellar Ataxia Functional Index, and the Modified Disability Rating Scale. Crossover data from the two 12-week periods in each group were included in the comparisons of NALL with placebo. A total of 60 patients 5 to 67 years of age were enrolled. The mean baseline SARA total scores used in the primary analysis were 15.88 before receipt of the first dose of NALL (60 patients) and 15.68 before receipt of the first dose of placebo (59 patients; 1 patient never received placebo). The mean (±SD) change from baseline in the SARA total score was -1.97±2.43 points after 12 weeks of receiving NALL and -0.60±2.39 points after 12 weeks of receiving placebo (least-squares mean difference, -1.28 points; 95% confidence interval, -1.91 to -0.65; P<0.001). The results for the secondary end points were generally supportive of the findings in the primary analysis, but these were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. The incidence of adverse events was similar with NALL and placebo, and no treatment-related serious adverse events occurred. Among patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C, treatment with NALL for 12 weeks led to better neurologic status than placebo. A longer period is needed to determine the long-term effects of this agent in patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C.

To investigate the safety and efficacy of N-acetyl-L-leucine (NALL) on symptoms, functioning, and quality of life in pediatric (≥ 6 years) and adult Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) patients. In this multi-national, open-label, rater-blinded Phase II study, patients were assessed during a baseline period, a 6-week treatment period (orally administered NALL 4 g/day in patients ≥ 13 years, weight-tiered doses for patients 6-12 years), and a 6-week post-treatment washout period. The primary Clinical Impression of Change in Severity (CI-CS) endpoint (based on a 7-point Likert scale) was assessed by blinded, centralized raters who compared randomized video pairs of each patient performing a pre-defined primary anchor test (8-Meter Walk Test or 9-Hole Peg Test) during each study periods. Secondary outcomes included cerebellar functional rating scales, clinical global impression, and quality of life assessments. 33 subjects aged 7-64 years with a confirmed diagnosis of NPC were enrolled. 32 patients were included in the primary modified intention-to-treat analysis. NALL met the CI-CS primary endpoint (mean difference 0.86, SD = 2.52, 90% CI 0.25, 1.75, p = 0.029), as well as secondary endpoints. No treatment-related serious adverse events occurred. NALL demonstrated a statistically significant and clinical meaningfully improvement in symptoms, functioning, and quality of life in 6 weeks, the clinical effect of which was lost after the 6-week washout period. NALL was safe and well-tolerated, informing a favorable benefit-risk profile for the treatment of NPC. CLINICALTRIALS. NCT03759639.

We aimed first to identify, in a spatially resolved manner, the specific metabolic changes in plaque, media, adventitia, and cardiac tissue between control and atherosclerotic murine aortas. Second, we assessed their translatability to human tissue and plasma for cardiovascular risk estimation. In this observational study, mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) was applied to identify region-specific metabolic differences between atherosclerotic (n=11) and control (n=11) aortas from low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice, via histology-guided virtual microdissection. Early and advanced plaques were compared within the same atherosclerotic animals. Progression metabolites were further analyzed by MSI in 9 human atherosclerotic carotids and by targeted mass spectrometry in human plasma from subjects with elective coronary artery bypass grafting (cardiovascular risk group, n=27) and a control group (n=27). MSI identified 362 local metabolic alterations in atherosclerotic mice (log2 fold-change ≥1.5;  An altered phospholipid metabolism occurs in atherosclerosis, affecting both the aorta and the adjacent heart tissue. Plaque-progression lipids LPC(18:0) and LPA(18:1), as identified by MSI on tissue, reflect cardiovascular risk in human plasma. In human subjects and animal models with acute and chronic lung injury, the bioactive lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) is elevated in lung lining fluids. The increased LPC can promote an inflammatory microenvironment resulting in lung injury. Furthermore, pathological lung conditions are associated with upregulated phospholipase A2 (PLA2), the predominant enzyme producing LPC in tissues by hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine. However, the lung cell populations responsible for increases of LPC have yet to be systematically characterized. The goal was to investigate the LPC generation by bronchial epithelial cells in response to pathological mediators and determine the major LPC species produced. Primary human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) were challenged by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for 1 or 6 h, and condition medium and cells collected for quantification of predominant LPC species by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). The cells were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for PLA2. The direct effects of LPC in inducing inflammatory activities on NHBE were assessed by transepithelial resistance as well as expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1). VEGF stimulation of NHBE for 1 or 6 h, significantly increased concentrations of LPC16:0, LPC18:0, and LPC18:1 in condition medium compared to control. The sPLA2-selective inhibitor (oleyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) inhibited the VEGF-induced release of LPC16:0 and LPC18:1 and PLA2 activity. In contrast, NHBE stimulated with TNF did not induce LPC release. VEGF did not increase mRNA of PLA2 subtypes sPLA2-X, sPLA2-XIIa, cPLA2-IVa, and iPLA2-VI. Exogenous LPC treatment increased expression of IL-8 and MMP-1, and reduced the transepithelial resistance in NHBE. Our findings indicate that VEGF-stimulated bronchial epithelial cells are a key source of extracellular LPCs, which can function as an autocrine mediator with potential to induce airway epithelial inflammatory injury. Neuropathic pain is a maladaptive and chronic condition with limited effective treatments. Although recent studies have suggested that certain lipid metabolites, like lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), may contribute to chronic pain, their specific roles and mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated the role and mechanism of LPC(18:1), a lipid subtype, in neuropathic pain caused by nerve injury. Using a mouse model of spinal nerve ligation, LPC(18:1) levels were measured in serum, dorsal root ganglion (DRG), spinal cord (SC) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Nociception was assessed using von Frey and Hargreaves' methods, while molecular analyses explored inflammatory pathways and oxidative stress. LPC(18:1) levels significantly increased in the serum, DRG and CSF after nerve injury. Administration of LPC(18:1) induced heightened pain responses and activated inflammatory pathways, including protein kinase C (PKC) and extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) in the DRG, as well as glial cells in the SC. The findings suggested that oxidative stress played a role in LPC(18:1) production, and its effects were mediated by G protein-coupled receptor 132 (GPR132). LPC(18:1) may serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for managing neuropathic pain.

106369.0	('Lecithin', 'Soybean phospholipid', 'Azolectin', 'Palmitoyl-linoleoyl phosphatidylcholine', 'Soybean lecithin')	mouse	"Lecithin ( LESS-ith-in; from the Ancient Greek λέκιθος lékithos ""yolk"") is a generic term to designate any group of yellow-brownish fatty substances occurring in animal and plant tissues which are amphiphilic – they attract both water and fatty substances (and so are both hydrophilic and lipophilic), and are used for smoothing food textures, emulsifying, homogenizing liquid mixtures, and repelling sticking materials. Lecithins are mixtures of glycerophospholipids including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidic acid. Lecithin was first isolated in 1845 by the French chemist and pharmacist Théodore Gobley. In 1850, he named the phosphatidylcholine lécithine. Gobley originally isolated lecithin from egg yolk and established the complete chemical formula of phosphatidylcholine in 1874; in between, he demonstrated the presence of lecithin in a variety of biological materials, including venous blood, human lungs, bile, roe, and brains of humans, sheep and chicken. Lecithin can easily be extracted chemically using solvents such as hexane, ethanol, acetone, petroleum ether or benzene; or extraction can be done mechanically. Common sources include egg yolk, marine foods, soybeans, milk, rapeseed, cottonseed, and sunflower oil. It has low solubility in water, but is an excellent emulsifier. In aqueous solution, its phospholipids can form either liposomes, bilayer sheets, micelles, or lamellar structures, depending on hydration and temperature. This results in a type of surfactant that usually is classified as amphipathic. Lecithin is sold as a food additive and dietary supplement. In cooking, it is sometimes used as an emulsifier and to prevent sticking, for example in non-stick cooking spray. == Production == Commercial lecithin, as used by food manufacturers, is a mixture of phospholipids in oil. The lecithin can be obtained by water degumming the extracted oil of seeds. It is a mixture of various phospholipids, and the composition depends on the origin of the lecithin. A major source of lecithin is soybean oil. Because of the EU requirement to declare additions of allergens in foods, in addition to regulations regarding genetically modified crops, a gradual shift to other sources of lecithin (such as sunflower lecithin) is taking place. The main phospholipids in lecithin from soy and sunflower are phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidic acid. They are often abbreviated to PC, PI, PE, PS and PA, respectively. Purified phospholipids are produced by companies commercially. === Hydrolysed lecithin === To modify the performance of lecithin to make it suitable for the product to which it is added, it may be hydrolysed enzymatically. In hydrolysed lecithins, a portion of the phospholipids have one fatty acid removed by phospholipase. Such phospholipids are called lysophospholipids. The most commonly used phospholipase is phospholipase A2, which removes the fatty acid at the C2 position of glycerol. Lecithins may also be modified by a process called fractionation. During this process, lecithin is mixed with an alcohol, usually ethanol. Some phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine, have good solubility in ethanol, whereas most other phospholipids do not dissolve well in ethanol. The ethanol is separated from the lecithin sludge, after which the ethanol is removed by evaporation to obtain a phosphatidylcholine-enriched lecithin fraction. === Genetically modified crops as a source of lecithin === As described above, lecithin is highly processed. Therefore, genetically modified (GM) protein or DNA from the original GM crop from which it is derived often is undetectable – in other words, it is not substantially different from lecithin derived from non-GM crops. Nonetheless, consumer concerns about genetically modified food have extended to highly purified derivatives from GM food, such as lecithin. This concern led to policy and regulatory changes in the EU in 2000, when Commission Regulation (EC) 50/2000 was passed which required labelling of food containing additives derived from GMOs, including lecithin. Because it is nearly impossible to detect the origin of derivatives such as lecithin, the European regulations require those who wish to sell lecithin in Europe to use a meticulous, but essential system of identity preservation (IP). == Properties and applications == Lecithins have emulsification and lubricant properties, and are a surfactant. They can be completely metabolized (see inositol) by humans, so are well tolerated by humans and nontoxic when ingested. The major components of commercial soybean-derived lecithin are: 33–35% soybean oil 20–21% phosphatidylinositols 19–21% phosphatidylcholine 8–20% phosphatidylethanolamine 5–11% other phosphatides including phosphatidylserine 5% free carbohydrates 2–5% sterols 1% moisture Lecithin is used for applications in human food, animal feed, pharmaceuticals, paints, and other industrial applications. Applications include: In the pharmaceutical industry, it acts as a wetting agent, stabilizing agent and a choline enrichment carrier, helps in emulsification and encapsulation, and is a good dispersing agent. It can be used in manufacture of intravenous fat infusions and for therapeutic use. In animal feed, it enriches fat and protein and improves pelletization. In the paint industry, it forms protective coatings for surfaces with painting and printing ink, helps as a rust inhibitor, is a colour intensifying agent, catalyst, conditioning aid modifier, and dispersing aid; it is a good stabilizing and suspending agent, emulsifier, and wetting agent, helps in maintaining uniform mixture of several pigments, helps in grinding of metal oxide pigments, is a spreading and mixing aid, prevents hard settling of pigments, eliminates foam in water-based paints, and helps in fast dispersion of latex-based paints. Lecithin also may be used as a release agent for plastics, an anti-sludge additive in motor lubricants, an anti-gumming agent in gasoline, and an emulsifier, spreading agent, and antioxidant in textile, rubber, and other industries. === Food additive === The nontoxicity of lecithin leads to its use with food, as a food additive or in food preparation. It is used commercially in foods requiring a natural emulsifier or lubricant. In confectionery, it reduces viscosity, replaces more expensive ingredients, controls sugar crystallization and the flow properties of chocolate, helps in the homogeneous mixing of ingredients, improves shelf life for some products, and can be used as a coating. In emulsions and fat spreads, such as margarines with a high fat content of more than 75%, it stabilizes emulsions, reduces spattering (splashing and scattering of oil droplets) during frying, improves texture of spreads and flavor release. In doughs and baking, it reduces fat and egg requirements, helps even out distribution of ingredients in dough, stabilizes fermentation, increases volume, protects yeast cells in dough when frozen, and acts as a releasing agent to prevent sticking and simplify cleaning. It improves wetting properties of hydrophilic powders (such as low-fat proteins) and lipophilic powders (such as cocoa powder), controls dust, and helps complete dispersion in water. Lecithin keeps cocoa and cocoa butter in a candy bar from separating. It can be used as a component of cooking sprays to prevent sticking and as a releasing agent. In the EU Lecithin is designated at food additive E322. === Dietary supplement === Lecithin contains dietary precursors to choline, an essential nutrient, which was formerly classified as a B vitamin (vitamin B4). Lecithin is a mixture of fats that contains phospholipids, including phosphatidylcholine, and the human body can convert phosphatidylcholine into choline. The choline content in lecithin can vary, but it's found that phosphatidylcholine makes up about 25 to 35 percent of lecithin. Furthermore, only about 12 percent of phosphatidylcholine is actually choline. This adds up to a choline content of approximately 4 percent for lecithin. For example, 10 grams of lecithin has 2,500mg of phosphatidylcholine. Phosphatidylcholine is approximately 13.7% choline; as such, about 342mg of choline is present per 10 grams of lecithin. Therefore, 10 grams of lecithin can be a source for the body to produce about the same amount of choline (342mg) as can be produced by the body from 2 egg yolks. The recommended intake of choline varies depending on age, sex, and physiological conditions, and is roughly 500 mg per day for adults. Lecithin is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA. There is no robust, scientifically validated clinical research investigating the safety and effectiveness of high-dose lecithin supplementation in lactating women and their infants. A meta-analysis found no evidence that high doses of lecithin improved milk flow in breast-feeding mothers or infants, though concluded that ""higher maternal choline intake was likely to be associated with better child neurocognition and neurodevelopment."" Soy lecithin does not contain enough allergenic proteins for most people allergic to soy, although the US FDA only exempts a few soy lecithin products from its mandatory requirements for allergenic source labeling. An alternative source of lecithin, derived from sunflowers, is available as a dietary supplement for those with concerns about soy-based foods. A 2003 review of randomized trials found no benefit of lecithin in people with dementia. === Religious restrictions === Soy-derived lecithin is considered by some to be kitniyot and prohibited on Passover for Ashkenazi Jews when many grain-based foods are forbidden, but not at other times. This does not necessarily affect Sephardi Jews, who do not have the same restrictions on rice and kitniyot during Passover. Muslims are not forbidden to eat lecithin per se; however, since it may be derived from animal as well as plant sources, care must be taken to ensure the source is halal. Lecithin derived from plants and egg yolks is permissible, as is that derived from animals slaughtered according to the rules of dhabihah. Sunflower lecithin, sourced from the seeds of sunflowers, is entirely plant-based and may be an option for those with religious or cultural concerns regarding food intake. == See also == Phytosome == References == == External links == Introduction to Lecithin Archived 2020-11-27 at the Wayback Machine (University of Erlangen) FDA Industry guideline for soy lecithin labeling European Lecithin Manufacturers Association official website Shurtleff W, Aoyagi A (2016).

Herein, we describe analogs of the naturally occurring mixed κ/μ-ligand c[Phe-d-Pro-Phe-Trp] 1 (CJ-15,208). Receptor affinity, selectivity, and agonism/antagonism varied upon enlarging macrocycle size, giving the μ-agonist 9 or the δ-antagonist 10 characterized by low nanomolar affinity. In particular, the μ-agonist c[β-Ala-d-Pro-Phe-Trp] 9 was shown to elicit potent antinociception in a mouse model of visceral pain upon systemic administration. Eps15 homology (EH) domains interact with proteins involved in endocytosis and signal transduction. EH domains bind to Asn-Pro-Phe (NPF) consensus motifs of target proteins. A few EH domains, such as the third EH domain (EH(3)) of human Eps15, prefer to bind Phe-Trp (FW) sequences. The structure of EH(3) has been solved by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and is the first of an FW- and NPF-binding EH domain. Both FW and NPF sequences bind in the same hydrophobic pocket as shown by heteronuclear chemical shift mapping. EH(3) contains the dual EF-hand fold characteristic of the EH domain family, but it binds calcium with high affinity in the first EF-hand rather than the usual coordination in the second EF-hand. Point mutations were designed based on differences in the EH(3) and the second EH domain (EH(2)) of human Eps15 that alter the affinity of the domains for FW or NPF motif peptides. Peptides that mimic binding sites in the potential EH(3) targets Rab, synaptojanin, and the cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor were used to explore wild-type and mutant affinities. Characterization of the structure and binding properties of an FW- and NPF-binding EH domain and comparison to an NPF-specific EH domain provide important insights into the mechanisms of EH domain ligand recognition.

However, there are few reports on the effects of nanomaterials as vectors on cancer metabolic reprogramming. Herein, a type of nanoparticle with good biocompatibility was synthesized by modifying the double-stranded of DNA containing a sulfhydryl group on the surface of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs-dsDNA) through salt-aging conjugation methods. The resultant AuNPs-dsDNA complexes possessed low toxicity to PC3 and DU145 cells in vitro. There was also no obvious hepatorenal toxicity after intravenous injection of AuNPs-dsDNA complexes in vivo, which indicated that these nanoparticles had good biological compatibilities. We investigated their biological functions using prostate cancer cells. Seahorse assay showed that AuNPs-dsDNA complexes could increase glycolysis and glycolysis capacity both in PC3 and DU145 cells. We further detected the expression of glycolysis-related genes by qPCR assay, and found that PKM2, PDHA, and LDHA were significantly upregulated. Furthermore, untargeted metabolomics revealed that PC (18:2(9Z,12Z)/18:2(9Z,12Z)) and PC (18:0/18:2 (9Z,12Z)) levels were decreased and inosinic acid level was increased in PC3 cells. Whereas (3S,6E,10E)-1,6,10,14-Phytatetraen-3-ol, Plasmenyl-PE 36:5 and Cer (d18:2/18:2) were decreased, PE 21:3 and 1-pyrrolidinecarboxaldehyde were increased in DU145 cells after co-culturing with AuNPs-dsDNA. In summary, we found that AuNPs and AuNPs-dsDNA complexes possibly regulate the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells mainly through the lipid metabolic pathways, which could compensate for the previously mentioned phenomenon of enhanced glycolysis and glycolysis capacity. This will provide an important theoretical basis for our future research on the characteristic targeted design of nanomaterials for cancer metabolism. Pangasius hypopthalmus is well known as a good source of protein. However, Pangasius hypopthalmus meat (PHM) can be adulterated with pork for economic concern, thus, analytical methods for authentication are required. Untargeted metabolomics and proteomics using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) and chemometrics of principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was successfully used to differentiate authentic and adulterated PHM with the good of fitness (R > 0.95) and good of predictivity (Q > 0.5). Metabolites of PC(o-18:0/18:2(9Z,12Z)) was found to be a potential marker for pork whereas DMPC (dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine) was a potential marker for PHM. Meanwhile, pork peptide marker of myoglobin (HPGDFGADAQGAMSK) and β-hemoglobin (FFESFGDLSNADAVMGNPK) could be identified. Both metabolomics and proteomics using LC-HRMS could detect pork at the lowest concentration level (0.5% w/w). In conclusion, untargeted metabolomics and proteomics using LC-HRMS in combination with chemometrics could be used as powerful methods to detect pork adulteration in fish meat. Understanding and elucidating the diverse structures and functions of lipids has motivated the development of many innovative tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) strategies. Higher-energy activation methods, such as ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD), generate unique fragment ions from glycerophospholipids that can be used to perform in-depth structural analysis and facilitate the deconvolution of isomeric lipid structures in complex samples. Although detailed characterization is central to the correlation of lipid structure to biological function, it is often impeded by the lack of sufficient instrument sensitivity for highly bioactive but low-abundance phospholipids.

The clinical data of 12 patients, all sensitised by one particular baby body lotion containing 0.3% of the emulsifier, are presented. The cross-reaction pattern of oleamidopropyl dimethylamine was investigated by patch testing 13 patients allergic to the emulsifier with a series of related amideamine type emulsifiers.

However, long-term effects of existing therapeutic modalities for depression are not satisfactory. Geniposide is an iridoid compound highly expressed in gardenia jasminoides for removing annoyance. The activity of geniposide against depression has been widely studied while most studies concentrated on the expression levels of gene and protein. Herein, the aim of the present study was to employ non-target metabolomic platform of serum to investigate metabolic changes of depression mice and further verify in hippocampus for analyzing the antidepressant mechanism of geniposide. Then we discovered that 9 metabolites of serum were significantly increased in depressive group (prostaglandin E2, leukotriene C4, arachidonic acid, phosphatidylcholine (PC, 16:0/16:0), LysoPC (18:1 (9Z)/0:0), phosphatidylethanolamine (14:0/16:0), creatine, oleamide and aminomalonic acid) and 6 metabolites were decreased (indoxylsulfuric acid, testosterone, lactic acid, glucose 6-phosphate, leucine and valine). The levels of arachidonic acid, LysoPC, lactic acid and glucose 6-phosphate in hippocampus were consistent change with serum in depression mice. Most of them showed significant tendencies to be normal by geniposide treatment. Metabolic pathway analysis indicated that arachidonic acid metabolism and glucose metabolism were the main pathogenesis for the antidepressant effect of geniposide. In addition, the levels of serum tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1 were increased in depressive mice and reversed after geniposide treatment. This study revealed that abnormal metabolism of inflammatory response and glucose metabolism of the serum and hippocampus involved in the occurrence of depressive disorder and antidepressant effect of geniposide.

There are significant differences in many metabonomic characteristics between FTC and FTN, suggesting that these metabolites can be used as potential biomarkers. Further study found that LysoPA and its analogues can be used as biomarkers in the early diagnosis of FTC.It may be related to the abnormal metabolism of phospholipase D (PLD), the key enzyme of LysoPA synthesis caused by RAS pathway. At the same time, it was found that the metabolic pathway of amino acids and lipids was the main metabolic pathway of FTC. The abnormality of LysoPA may be the cause of follicular tumor carcinogenesis caused by lipid metabolic pathway. Our aim was to identify changes in the metabolome in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) as well as to construct a metabolic diagnostic model for DCM. We utilized non-targeted metabolomics with a cross-sectional cohort of age- and sex-matched DCM patients and controls. Metabolomics data were analyzed using orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and pathway analysis. It was validated in combination with transcriptome sequencing data from public databases. Machine learning models were used for the diagnosis of DCM. Using multiple analytical techniques, 130 metabolite alterations were identified in DCM compared to healthy controls. Perturbations in glycerophospholipid metabolism (GPL) were identified and validated as a characteristic metabolic pathway in DCM. Through the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), we identified the 7 most important GPL metabolites, including LysoPA (16:0/0:0), LysoPA (18:1(9Z)/0:0), PC (20:3(8Z,11Z,14Z)/20:1(11Z)), PC (20:0/14:0), LysoPC (16:0), PS(15:0/18:0), and PE(16:0/20:4 (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)).

We find that the inserted organic hydroperoxide group -OOH migrates preferentially to the surface for bilayers with small fractions of hydroperoxidized lipids, but populates also significantly the bilayer interior for larger fractions.

113350.0	('Stearic acid', 'Octadecanoic acid', 'N-octadecanoic acid', 'Stearophanic acid', 'Cetylacetic acid')	mouse	"Stearic acid ( STEER-ik, stee-ARR-ik) is a saturated fatty acid with an 18-carbon chain. The IUPAC name is octadecanoic acid. It is a soft waxy solid with the formula CH3(CH2)16CO2H. The triglyceride derived from three molecules of stearic acid is called stearin. Stearic acid is a prevalent fatty-acid in nature, found in many animal and vegetable fats, but is usually higher in animal fat than vegetable fat. It has a melting point of 69.4 °C (156.9 °F) °C and a pKa of 4.50. Its name comes from the Greek word στέαρ ""stéar"", which means tallow. The salts and esters of stearic acid are called stearates. As its ester, stearic acid is one of the most common saturated fatty acids found in nature and in the food supply, following palmitic acid. Dietary sources of stearic acid include meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, and foods prepared with fats; beef tallow, lard, butterfat, cocoa butter, and shea butter are rich fat sources of stearic acid. == Production == In terms of its biosynthesis, stearic acid is produced from palmitoyl-CoA, with malonyl-CoA a two-carbon building block (after decarboxylation). Stearic acid is obtained from fats and oils by the saponification of the triglycerides using hot water (about 100 °C). The resulting mixture is then distilled. Commercial stearic acid is often a mixture of stearic and palmitic acids, although purified stearic acid is available. Commercially, oleic acid, as found in palm and soy, can be hydrogenated to give stearic acid. == Uses and occurrence == In general, the applications of stearic acid exploit its bifunctional character, with a polar head group that can be attached to metal cations and a nonpolar chain that confers solubility in organic solvents. The combination leads to uses as a surfactant and softening agent. Stearic acid undergoes the typical reactions of saturated carboxylic acids, a notable one being reduction to stearyl alcohol, and esterification with a range of alcohols. This is used in a large range of manufactures, from simple to complex electronic devices. === Food === Of the saturated fatty acids consumed in the United States, stearic acid consumption is second (26% of total saturated fatty acid intake) to palmitic acid (56% of total saturated fatty acid intake). Stearic acid is more abundant in animal fat (up to 33% in beef liver: 739 ) than in vegetable fat (typically less than 5%). The important exceptions are the foods cocoa butter (34%) and shea butter, where the stearic acid content (as a triglyceride) is 28–45%. Examples of the use of stearic acid in food manufacturing include baked goods, frozen dairy products, gelatins, puddings, hard candy, and nonalcoholic beverages. Stearic acid (E number E570) is found in some foods. === Soaps and cosmetics === Stearic acid is mainly used in the production of detergents, soaps, and cosmetics such as shampoos and shaving cream products. Stearate soap, such as sodium stearate, could be made from stearic acid but instead are usually produced by saponification of stearic acid-containing triglycerides. Esters of stearic acid with ethylene glycol (glycol stearate and glycol distearate) are used to produce a pearly effect in shampoos, soaps, and other cosmetic products. === Lubricants, softening and release agents === In view of the soft texture of the sodium salt, which is the main component of soap, other salts are also useful for their lubricating properties. Lithium stearate is an important component of grease. The stearate salts of zinc, calcium, cadmium, and lead are used as heat stabilizers for PVC. Stearic acid is used along with castor oil for preparing softeners in textile sizing. They are heated and mixed with caustic potash or caustic soda. Related salts are also commonly used as release agents, e.g. in the production of automobile tires. As an example, it can be used to make castings from a plaster piece mold or waste mold, and to make a mold from a shellacked clay original. In this use, powdered stearic acid is mixed in water and the suspension is brushed onto the surface to be parted after casting. This reacts with the calcium in the plaster to form a thin layer of calcium stearate, which functions as a release agent. Steric acid can be converted to zinc stearate, which is used as a lubricant for playing cards (fanning powder) to ensure a smooth motion when fanning. Stearic acid is a common lubricant during injection molding and pressing of ceramic powders. === Niche uses === Being inexpensive, nontoxic, and fairly inert, stearic acid finds many niche applications. Varied examples of stearic acid use in manufacturing include soaps and greases, household soap products, synthetic rubber, cosmetic and pharmaceutical creams and lotions, candles, phonograph records, lubricants, shoe and metal polishes, food packaging, and rubber compounds. Stearic acid is used as a negative plate additive in the manufacture of lead-acid batteries. It is added at the rate of 0.6 g per kg of the oxide while preparing the paste. It is believed to enhance the hydrophobicity of the negative plate, particularly during dry-charging process. It also reduces the extension of oxidation of the freshly formed lead (negative active material) when the plates are kept for drying in the open atmosphere after the process of tank formation. As a consequence, the charging time of a dry uncharged battery during initial filling and charging (IFC) is comparatively lower, as compared to a battery assembled with plates which do not contain stearic acid additive. Fatty acids are classic components of candle-making. Stearic acid is used along with simple sugar or corn syrup as a hardener in candies. == Metabolism == An isotope labeling study in humans concluded that the fraction of dietary stearic acid that oxidatively desaturates to oleic acid is 2.4 times higher than the fraction of palmitic acid analogously converted to palmitoleic acid. Also, stearic acid is less likely to be incorporated into cholesterol esters. In epidemiologic and clinical studies, stearic acid was found to be associated with lowered LDL cholesterol in comparison with other saturated fatty acids. === Examples === Salts Potassium stearate Calcium stearate Cobaltous stearate Lithium stearate Magnesium stearate Mercuric stearate Sodium stearate Zinc stearate Esters Estradiol stearate Glycol stearate Stearin Testosterone stearate == References == == External links == NIST Chemistry WebBook Entry"	Stearic acid	WIKIPEDIA	('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.06213080883026123), ('OD', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -0.022214749827980995), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -1.318681188422488e-05), (' INDUSTR', -1.9146995327901095e-05), ('IAL', 0.0)])
21408.0	('Isoleucyl-proline', 'Ile-pro', 'H-ile-pro-oh', 'Isoleucyl-l-proline', 'Proline, l-isoleucyl-')	mouse	 Isoleucine-proline-proline (Ile-Pro-Pro, IPP) is a natural food source tripeptide that inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity. The aim of this study was to determine the central and peripheral roles of IPP in attenuating sympathetic activity, oxidative stress and hypertension. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to sham-operated surgery (Sham) or two-kidney one-clip (2K1C) surgery to induce renovascular hypertension. Renal sympathetic nerve activity and blood pressure were recorded. Bilateral microinjections of IPP to hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) attenuated sympathetic activity (-16.1 ± 2.5%, P < 0.001) and hypertension (-8.7 ± 1.5 mmHg, P < 0.01) in 2K1C rats by inhibiting ACE activity and subsequent angiotensin II and superoxide production in the PVN. Intravenous injections of IPP also attenuated sympathetic activity (-15.1 ± 2.1%, P < 0.001) and hypertension (-16.8 ± 2.3 mmHg, P < 0.001) via inhibiting ACE activity and oxidative stress in both PVN and arteries of 2K1C rats. The duration of the effects of the intravenous IPP was longer than those of the PVN microinjection, but the sympatho-inhibitory effect of intravenous injections occurred later than that of the PVN microinjection. Intraperitoneal injection of IPP (400 pmol/day for 20 days) attenuated hypertension and vascular remodeling via inhibiting ACE activity and oxidative stress in both PVN and arteries of 2K1C rats. These results indicate that IPP attenuates hypertension and sympathetic activity by inhibiting ACE activity and oxidative stress. The sympathoinhibitory effect of peripheral IPP is mainly caused by the ACE inhibition in PVN, and the antihypertensive effect is related to the sympathoinhibition and the arterial ACE inhibition. Long-term intraperitoneal IPP therapy attenuates hypertension, oxidative stress and vascular remodeling. Much clinical evidence on the antihypertensive effects of the milk-derived antihypertensive peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (lactotripeptides) has been reported. However, circadian rhythm effects determined by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to eliminate the confounding influence of the white-coat effect have not been fully studied. Twelve hypertensive patients not receiving antihypertensive medication (2 men, 10 women; mean age±standard deviation, 63.5±8.3 years) who had been visiting our clinic for more than 1 year participated in this study. Mean (±standard deviation) systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were 142.4±2.6 and 83.5±6.4 mm Hg, respectively, at the first office visit. After patients ingested a fermented milk product containing antihypertensive peptides (2.53 mg Val-Pro-Pro; 1.52 mg Ile-Pro-Pro) for more than 4 weeks, both office SBP and DBP were significantly reduced to a mean (±standard deviation) of 133.3±7.0 mm Hg and 76.5±8.4 mm Hg (P<.001 and P<.005 by paired t-test), respectively. The 24-hour SBP and DBP determined by ABPM were reduced from 127.3±2.4 and 78.7±2.3 mm Hg to 120.2±2.4 and 75.0±2.2 mm Hg (P<.001 and P<.05), respectively. Awake-time SBP (08:00-21:00), night-time SBP (0:00-05:00), and early-morning SBP (06:00-07:00) were reduced from 130.9±2.4 to 123.3±2.3 mm Hg, 118.7±2.9 to 113.2±3.4 mm Hg, and 132.8±4.3 to 122.4±3.9 mm Hg (by paired t-test: P<.001, P<.05, and P<.05), respectively. As seen with DBP measured by ABPM, 24-hour DBP and awake-time DBP were significantly reduced from 78.7±2.3 to 75.0±2.2 mm Hg and 82.1±2.5 to 77.3±2.2 mm Hg (P<.05 and P<.01), respectively. Office BP and 24-hour blood pressure did not significantly differ between the dipper and nondipper groups at baseline. However, after treatment, night-time and early-morning blood pressure were significantly reduced from baseline in the nondipper group (-8.5±2.5 and -15.6±3.7 mm Hg; P<.05 and P<.01, respectively) but not in the dipper group (-2.5±3.6 and -1.2±4.7 mm Hg; P not significant), and the reduction in early-morning blood pressure significantly differed between the groups (P<.05). These results suggest that Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro decrease blood pressure in patients with stage I hypertension and result not only in lower blood pressure at night-time but also in lower early-morning SBP in nondipper patients. Milk casein-derived bioactive tripeptides isoleucine-proline-proline (Ile-Pro-Pro) and valine-proline-proline (Val-Pro-Pro) lower blood pressure in animal models of hypertension and humans. In some studies, their angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory effect has been demonstrated. Besides classical ACE-angiotensin II-AT(1)-receptor pathway (ACE-Ang II- AT(1)), the significance of ACE2-angiotensin-(1-7)-Mas-receptor (ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas) axis in the blood pressure regulation has now been acknowledged. The present study was aimed to further evaluate the renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-related vascular effects of Ile-Pro-Pro in vitro using rat mesenteric arteries. Superior mesenteric arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) were isolated, cut into rings and mounted in standard organ bath chambers. Endothelium-intact arterial rings were incubated in Krebs solution either with Ile-Pro-Pro, proline-proline (Pro-Pro), isoleucine (Ile), proline (Pro) or captopril for 6h at +37°C and vascular reactivity was measured. In the presence of AT(1)-antagonist valsartan, Ang II induced vasodilatation, which was more pronounced in the arteries incubated with Ile-Pro-Pro (P<0.05) compared to the other compounds. Ang-(1-7)-induced vasodilatation was augmented by Ile-Pro-Pro or Pro (P<0.001 vs. control). Mas-receptor antagonist A-779 did not alter the responses. Ile-Pro-Pro and Pro augmented also bradykinin-induced relaxations (P<0.001 vs. control). Control arteries and arteries incubated with captopril showed only slight relaxations at higher bradykinin concentrations. Casein-derived tripeptide Ile-Pro-Pro and amino acid Pro enhance the vasodilatory effect of Ang-(1-7) and bradykinin. The role of ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis in the modulation of vascular tone by these compounds seems probable.

77097.0	('N-hexadecylphosphonocholine', 'Ncimech_000602', 'Miltefosine', 'Hexadecylphosphocholine', 'Miltex')	mouse	"Miltefosine, sold under the trade name Impavido among others, is a medication mainly used to treat leishmaniasis and free-living amoeba infections such as Naegleria fowleri and Balamuthia mandrillaris. This includes the three forms of leishmaniasis: cutaneous, visceral and mucosal. It may be used with liposomal amphotericin B or paromomycin. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, headaches, and decreased kidney function. More severe side effects may include Stevens–Johnson syndrome or low blood platelets. Use during pregnancy appears to cause harm to the baby and use during breastfeeding is not recommended. How it works is not entirely clear. Miltefosine was first made in the early 1980s and studied as a treatment for cancer. A few years later it was found to be useful for leishmaniasis and was approved for this use in 2002 in India. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == === Leishmaniasis === Miltefosine is primarily used for the treatment of visceral and New World cutaneous leishmaniasis, and is undergoing clinical trials for this use in several countries. This drug is now listed as a core medication for the treatment of leishmaniasis under the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. Several medical agents have some efficacy against visceral or cutaneous leishmaniasis, however, a 2005 survey concluded that miltefosine is the only effective oral treatment for both forms of leishmaniasis. === Amoeba infections === Miltefosine has been used successfully in some cases of the very rare, but highly lethal, brain infection by the amoeba, Naegleria fowleri, acquired through water entering the nose during a plunge in contaminated water. It has orphan drug status in the United States for acanthamoeba keratitis and primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Miltefosine is listed as pregnancy category D by the FDA. This means there is evidence-based adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans of harm to the human fetus. Despite this evidence, the potential benefits of miltefosine may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks. A pregnancy test should be done prior to starting treatment. Effective birth control should be used while on miltefosine and 5 months after discontinuation of treatment. Its use during breast feeding is most likely unsafe. == Contraindications == Miltefosine is contraindicated in individuals who have a hypersensitivity to this medication, pregnant women, and people who have the Sjögren-Larsson syndrome. It is embryotoxic and fetotoxic in rats and rabbits, and teratogenic in rats but not in rabbits. It is therefore contraindicated for use during pregnancy, and contraception is required beyond the end of treatment in women of child-bearing age. == Side effects == Common side effects from miltefosine treatment are nausea and vomiting, which occur in 60% of people. Other common side effects are dizziness, headache, and daytime sleepiness. Serious side effects include rash, diarrhea, and arthritis. The side effects are more severe in women and young children. The overall effects are quite mild and easily reversed. == Mechanism of action == Miltefosine primarily acts on Leishmania by affecting the species's promastigote and amastigote stages. Miltefosine exerts its activity by interacting with lipids, inhibiting cytochrome c oxidase and causing apoptosis-like cell death. This may affect membrane integrity and mitochondrial function of the parasite. == History == === Cancer === While initially studied as a cancer medication, due to side effects it was never used for this purpose. Phospholipid group alkylphosphocholine were known since the early 1980s, particularly in terms of their binding affinity with cobra venom. In 1987 the phospholipids were found to be potent toxins on leukemic cell culture. Initial in vivo investigation on the antineoplastic activity showed positive result, but then only at high dosage and at high toxicity. At the same time in Germany, Hansjörg Eibl, at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, and Clemens Unger, at the University of Göttingen, demonstrated that the antineoplastic activity of the phospholipid analogue miltefosine (at the time known as hexadecylphosphocholine) was indeed tumour-specific. It was highly effective against methylnitrosourea-induced mammary carcinoma, but less so on transplantable mammary carcinomas and autochthonous benzo(a)pyrene-induced sarcomas, and relatively inactive on Walker 256 carcinosarcoma and autochthonous acetoxymethylmethylnitrosamine-induced colonic tumors of rats. It was subsequently found that miltefosine was structurally unique among lipids having anticancer property in that it lacks the glycerol group, is highly selective on cell types and acts through different mechanism. === Leishmaniasis === In the same year as the discovery of the anticancer property, miltefosine was reported by S. L. Croft and his team at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine as having antileishmanial effect as well. The compound was effective against Leishmania donovani amastigotes in cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages at a dose of 12.8 mg/kg/day in a five-day course. However, priority was given to the development of the compound for cutaneous metastases of breast cancer. In 1992 a new research was reported in which the compound was highly effective in mouse against different life cycle stages of different Leishmania species, and in fact, more potent than the conventional sodium stibogluconate therapy by a factor of more than 600. Results of the first clinical trial in humans were reported from Indian patients with chronic leishmaniasis with high degree of success and safety. This promising development promulgated a unique public–private partnership collaboration between ASTA Medica (later Zentaris GmbH), the World Health Organization (WHO) Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases, and the Government of India. Eventually, several successful Phase II and III trials led to the approval of miltefosine in 2002 as the first and only oral drug for leishmaniasis. === Naegleria fowleri and Acanthamoeba === In 2013, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended miltefosine for the treatment of free-living amoeba infections such as granulomatous amoebic encephalitis and primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, two fatal protozoal diseases. Historically, only four survivors have been recorded out of 138 confirmed infections in North America. One American survived the infection in 1978 and one individual from Mexico in 2003. In 2013, two children survived and recovered from primary amoebic meningoencephalitis after treatment with miltefosine. In 2016 after treatment that included miltefosine, another child became the fourth person in the United States to survive Naegleria fowleri infection. == Society and culture == === Availability === Since 2017 Miltefosine is commercially available in the United States through Profounda. Previously one could only get it from the CDC for emergency use under an expanded access IND protocol for treatment of free-living amoeba (FLA) infections: primary amoebic meningoencephalitis caused by Naegleria fowleri and granulomatous amoebic encephalitis caused by Balamuthia mandrillaris and Acanthamoeba species. Miltefosine is almost exclusively produced by Profounda, a private pharmaceutical company. === Economics === In the developing world a course of treatment costs US$65 to $150. In the developed world treatment may be 10 to 50 times greater. == Further research == It is active against some bacteria and fungi, as well as human trematode Schistosoma mansoni and the snail that spreads it Biomphalaria alexandrina. === Antiprotozoal and antifungal activities === Miltefosine is being investigated by researchers interested in finding treatments for infections which have become resistant to existing drugs. Animal and in vitro studies suggest it may have broad anti-protozoal and anti-fungal properties: Animal studies suggest miltefosine may also be effective against Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas' disease. Several studies have found the drug to be effective against types of fungus: Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida, Aspergillus and Fusarium. A 2006 in vitro study found that miltefosine is effective against metronidazole-resistant variants of Trichomonas vaginalis, a sexually transmitted protozoal disease. Cetrimonium bromide, a compound related to miltefosine, was demonstrated in 2007 to exhibit potent in vitro activity against Plasmodium falciparum. An in vitro test in 2006 showed that miltefosine is effective against the deadly protozoan pathogens, Naegleria fowleri, Balamuthia mandrillaris, and Acanthamoeba. However, later in vitro and animal model experiments showed that it is not as potent as other drugs, such as chlorpromazine and diminazene aceturate (Berenil). In 2013, there were reports of failure of miltefosine in the treatment of leishmaniasis. Although drug resistance was suspected, studies in 2014 reported that miltefosine is not so effective in children, most probably related to a lack of drug exposure in children. Moverover, males appeared to have a higher probability of relapse as well. A 2012 in vitro study found that miltefosine had promising activity against Candida albicans biofilms. === Anti-HIV activity === Miltefosine targets HIV infected macrophages, which play a role in vivo as long-lived HIV-1 reservoirs. The HIV protein Tat activates pro-survival PI3K/Akt pathway in primary human macrophages. Miltefosine acts by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway, thus removing the infected macrophages from circulation, without affecting healthy cells. It significantly reduces replication of HIV-1 in cocultures of human dendritic cells (DCs) and CD4+ T cells, which is due to a rapid secretion of soluble factors and is associated with induction of type-I interferon (IFN) in the human cells. == References == == External links == ""Miltefosine"".

In this study, poly(2-methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) (PMPC) is used for the first time for modifying third-generation poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) to enhance their brain tumor-targeted drug delivery ability as well as simultaneously reducing the toxicity of PAMAM dendrimers and the tissue toxicity of the loaded doxorubicin (DOX). The cytotoxicity, the therapeutic ability in vitro, and the brain tumor-targeted ability of the PMPC modified PAMAM nanoparticles are further studied. Results indicate that PMPC, as a dual-functional modifier, can significantly reduce the cytotoxicity of PAMAM dendrimers, while efficiently target the brain tumor. In addition, the therapeutic effect of DOX-loaded PAMAM-PMPC in mice inoculated with U-87 is also studied in vivo. In comparison with DOX solution, DOX-loaded PAMAM-PMPC alleviates weight loss of tumor-inoculated mice and reduces the cardiotoxicity of DOX. The tumor growth inhibition, in vivo, is significantly increased up to (80.76 ± 1.66)%. In conclusion, this strategy of PMPC dual-functional targeted nanocarrier provides a new method for the delivery of chemotherapeutic drugs to treat glioma. Obesity is an established risk factor for higher SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, severe COVID-19 pneumonia requiring hospitalization, and worse outcomes. However, the underlying mechanisms for the increased risk are not well understood. SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory virus with the primary route of entry through the lungs, where the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 binds to the ACE2 receptor on pneumocytes. Lung surfactant produced by type II pneumocytes plays a major role in respiratory defense against infections. Surfactant predominantly contains lipids, especially phosphatidylcholines (PC), and obesity is characterized by aberrant lipid metabolism. We hypothesized that altered lipid composition in lung surfactant in obesity may promote SARS-CoV-2 infection, leading to severe COVID-19 disease. Lipidomic analysis of lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was performed using LC-MS/MS. The effects of PCs on SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection were studied in HEK293T cells with ACE2 overexpression and in Vero-E6 cells with endogenous ACE2 expression. For the cell-cell fusion assay, HEK293T-ACE2 and HEK293T expressing SARS-CoV-2 Spike/eGFP were used as the target and effector cells, respectively. Lipidomic analysis revealed that myristic acid-containing dimyristoyl-PC (DMPC) and palmitoylmyristoyl-PC (PMPC) were reduced in lung tissue and BALF from high fat diet-induced obese mice. DMPC and PMPC markedly inhibited wild type and D614G mutant SARS-CoV-2 infection in HEK293T-ACE2 and Vero-E6 cells. Feeding obese mice with trimyristin, the triglycerides of myristic acid, increased DMPC and PMPC levels in lung surfactant. Lipid extract from BALF of trimyristin-treated obese mice mitigated the elevated wild type and D614G mutant SARS-CoV-2 infection. The inhibitory effects of DMPC and PMPC on SARS-CoV-2 infection were reversed by cholesterol. The reduced DMPC and PMPC in lung surfactant may promote SARS-CoV-2 infection. Increasing DMPC and PMPC in lung surfactant could be an innovative strategy for preventing and treating severe COVID-19 disease in obesity. Polylactic acid (PLA) is one of the biodegradable materials that has been used in the areas of surgical healing lines, cancer treatment, and wound healing. However, the application of PLA is still rather limited due to its high hydrophobicity and poor antibacterial activity. In order to enhance the antifouling and antibacterial performances of PLA, here we modified the surface of PLA with various sizes of hydrogel micropatterns in negative or positive mode using plasma treatment, the photomask technique, and UV-graft polymerization. The hydrogel micropatterns consist of poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA), poly(2-methacryloyloxyethylphosphorylcholine) (PMPC), and poly(methacryloyloxyethyltrimethylammonium chloride) (PDMC). Compared to PLA, the patterned PLA (PLA-PMPC/PDMC/PEGDA) shows obviously enhanced antifouling and antibacterial activities. For PLA-PMPC/PDMC/PEGDA with either positive or negative micropatterns, the antifouling and antibacterial properties are gradually increasing with decreasing the size of micropatterns. Compared with PLA-PMPC/PDMC/PEGDA bearing positive and negative micropatterns in the same size, the PLA-PMPC/PDMC/PEGDA with negative micropatterns exhibits slightly better biological activity and the PLA-PMPC/PDMC/PEGDA with 3 μm negative hydrogel micropatterns shows the best hydrophilicity, antifouling, and antibacterial properties. Combining the in vitro hemolysis assay, cytotoxicity, water absorption test, and degradation test results, it is suggested that the fabrication of hydrogel micropatterns onto the PLA surface could significantly improve biological activities of PLA. We expect that this work would provide a new strategy to potentially develop PLA as a promising wound dressing.	Pmpc	PUBMED	('INFO', [('INFO', -0.4073176980018616)])

Previous studies have suggested that 2OHOA's anticancer effect is mediated by SMS activation in cancer cells, including A549 and U118 cells. To confirm this phenomenon, in this study, we treated both A549 and U118 cells with 2OHOA and measured SMS activity. To our surprise, we found neither 2OHOA-mediated SMS activation nor sphingomyelin accumulation in the cells. However, we noted that 2OHOA significantly reduces phosphatidylcholine in these cells. We also did not observe 2OHOA-mediated SMS activation in mouse tissue homogenates. Importantly, 2OHOA inhibited rather than activated recombinant SMS1 (rSMS1) and rSMS2 in a dose-dependent fashion. Intra-gastric treatment of C57BL/6J mice with 2OHOA for 10 days had no effects on liver and small intestine SMS activities and plasma sphingomyelin levels. The treatment inhibited lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT) activity, consistent with the aforementioned reduction in plasma phosphatidylcholine. Because total cellular phosphatidylcholine is used as a predictive biomarker for monitoring tumor responses, the previously reported 2OHOA-mediated cancer suppression could be related to this phosphatidylcholine reduction, which may influence cell membrane structure and properties. We conclude that 2OHOA is not a SMS activator and that its anticancer property may be related to an effect on phosphatidylcholine metabolism. A central tenet of the lipid raft model is the existence of non-raft domains. In support of this view, we have established in model membranes that a phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-containing docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) forms organizationally distinct non-raft domains in the presence of sphingomyelin (SM) and cholesterol (Chol). We have shown that formation of DHA-rich domains is driven by unfavorable molecular interactions between the rigid Chol molecule and the highly flexible DHA acyl chain. However, the molecular interactions between SM and the DHA-containing PE, which could also contribute to the formation of DHA-rich non-raft domains, have not been sufficiently investigated. To address this issue, we use differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) to study the phase behavior of mixtures of SM with either 1-palmitoyl-2-docosahexaenoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (16:0-22:6PE) or 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (16:0-18:1PE), an oleic acid (OA)-containing control, over a wide range of concentrations. Deconvolution of binary DSC scans shows that both 16:0-22:6PE and 16:0-18:1PE phase separate from SM. Analysis of transition temperatures and partial phase diagrams, constructed from the DSC scans for the first time, shows that 16:0-22:6PE displays greater non-ideal mixing with SM compared to 16:0-18:1PE. Our findings support a model in which DHA- and OA-containing PEs differentially phase separate from SM over a wide range of molar ratios to initiate the formation of non-raft domains, which is greatly enhanced by DHA, but not OA, in the presence of cholesterol.

The 24-h urinary excretion of  N Nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) is a novel histone methylation modulator that regulates energy metabolism, and NNMT knockdown prevents diet-induced obesity in mice. However, whether NNMT plays a role in human obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2DM) remains to be elucidated. NNMT catalyzes methylation of nicotinamide to generate N(1)-methylnicotinamide (me-NAM). We aimed to investigate the associations of serum me-NAM with obesity and T2DM in Chinese. The study subjects (n = 1160) were recruited from Dali, a city of Yunnan Province, in southwest China. Anthropometric phenotypes, fasting glucose, and serum lipids were measured. Serum me-NAM was measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Serum me-NAM was positively correlated with body mass index and waist circumference and negatively with high-density lipoprotein (P ≤ .03). The correlations remained highly significant in the multivariate adjusted correlation analyses. In men (n = 691), positive correlations between me-NAM and fasting glucose, low-density lipoprotein, liver function, and serum creatinine levels were also observed in both simple and multivariate adjusted correlation analyses. In multiple logistic regression analyses, elevated serum me-NAM was associated with higher risks for overweight/obesity (odds ratios, 2.36 and 5.78; 95% confidence intervals, 1.10-5.08 and 1.78-18.76 for men and women, respectively; P ≤ .03) and diabetes (odds ratios, 1.56 and 1.86; 95% confidence intervals, 1.10-2.22 and 1.05-3.31 for men and women, respectively; P ≤ .03). This first large-scale population study shows that me-NAM, as an indicator of NNMT activity, is strongly associated with obesity and diabetes, supporting NNMT as a potential target for treating obesity and diabetes in humans.

5305.0	('Raffinose', 'Melitose', 'Gossypose', 'Melitriose', 'Rafinose')	mouse	"Raffinose is a trisaccharide composed of galactose, glucose, and fructose. It can be found in beans, cabbage, brussels sprouts, broccoli, asparagus, other vegetables, and whole grains. Raffinose can be hydrolyzed to D-galactose and sucrose by the enzyme α-galactosidase (α-GAL), an enzyme synthesized by bacteria found in the large intestine. α-GAL also hydrolyzes other α-galactosides such as stachyose, verbascose, and galactinol, if present. In plants, raffinose plays a significant role in stress responses, particularly temperature sensitivity, seed vigour, resistance to pathogens, and desiccation. == Chemical properties == The raffinose family of oligosaccharides (RFOs) are α-galactosyl derivatives of sucrose, the most common being the trisaccharide raffinose, the tetrasaccharide stachyose, and the pentasaccharide verbascose. RFOs are almost ubiquitous across the plant kingdom, being found in a large variety of seeds from many different families. They rank second only to sucrose in abundance as soluble carbohydrates. Raffinose typically crystallises as a pentahydrate white crystalline powder. It is odorless and has a sweet taste approximately 10% that of sucrose. == Biochemical properties == === Energy source === It is non-digestible in humans and other monogastric animals (pigs and poultry) who do not possess the α-GAL enzyme to break down RFOs. These oligosaccharides pass undigested through the stomach and small intestine. In the large intestine, they are fermented by bacteria that do possess the α-GAL enzyme and make short-chain fatty acids (SCFA)(acetic, propionic, butyric acids), as well as the flatulence commonly associated with eating beans and other vegetables. These SCFAs have been recently found to impart a number of health benefits. α-GAL is present in digestive aids such as the product Beano. === Plant Health === Cases of abiotic stress such as temperature, drought, and salinity have shown to increase RFO levels, especially raffinose, in plants. The functional role raffinose plays in abiotic stress tolerance is not well known, but its presence as a positive regulator of these stresses is established. Galactinol synthase (GolS) is an enzyme key in the synthesis of RFOs. Studies which modify the expression of GolS have been done to understand the role of RFOs in stress response. GolS has been found to induce salicylic acid signalling pathways and expression of defence-related genes, showing RFOs to have a role in pathogen resistance. RFOs have been seen to assist in seed germination. They are used as a source of energy and carbon for germination, and protect the seed from desiccation during the maturation process. One proposed mechanism of RFOs working against desiccation details the hydroxyl groups replacing water to maintain hydrophilicity ion the cell, which stabilizes the membrane structure and macromolecules needed for cellular function. Another mechanism, called ""vitrification"", has the cell taking on a highly viscous form, like that of a plastic solid. This maintains cellular stability and hydrogen bonding in the cell, and prevents cellular collapse. In many plants, RFOs have been seen to act as an alternative to sucrose for sugar storage and transport. == Disease relevance == Research has shown that the differential ability to utilize raffinose by strains of the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae impacts their ability to cause disease and the nature of the disease. == Uses == Procedures concerning cryopreservation have used raffinose to provide hypertonicity for cell desiccation prior to freezing. Either raffinose or sucrose is used as a base substance for sucralose. Raffinose is also used in: skin moisturizers and cosmetics prebiotics (it promotes growth of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria) food or drinks additive chiral stationary phase in HPLC == See also == Raffinose—raffinose alpha-galactosyltransferase Raphanin == Further reading == D(+)-Raffinose pentahydrate, Chemical Books == References =="	Raffinose	WIKIPEDIA	('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -1.259079363080673e-05), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -1.981667537620524e-06), (' PERSONAL', -0.0010380487656220794), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.07899355888366699), (' INDUSTR', -3.619311974034645e-05), ('IAL', 0.0)])
39547.0	('N-acetyl-l-cysteine', 'Acetylcysteine', 'N-acetylcysteine', 'Mercapturic acid', 'Acetadote')	mouse	 N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) is a compound of increasing interest in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Primarily through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and glutamate modulation activity, NAC has been investigated in the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders, schizophrenia spectrum disorders, bipolar-related disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive-related disorders, substance-use disorders, neurocognitive disorders, and chronic pain. Whilst there is ample preclinical evidence and theoretical justification for the use of NAC in the treatment of multiple psychiatric disorders, clinical trials in most disorders have yielded mixed results. However, most studies have been underpowered and perhaps too brief, with some evidence of benefit only after months of treatment with NAC. Currently NAC has the most evidence of having a beneficial effect as an adjuvant agent in the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, severe autism, depression, and obsessive compulsive and related disorders. Future research with well-powered studies that are of sufficient length will be critical to better understand the utility of NAC in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. NAC (N-acetyl-L-cysteine) is commonly used to identify and test ROS (reactive oxygen species) inducers, and to inhibit ROS. In the present study, we identified inhibition of proteasome inhibitors as a novel activity of NAC. Both NAC and catalase, another known scavenger of ROS, similarly inhibited ROS levels and apoptosis associated with H₂O₂. However, only NAC, and not catalase or another ROS scavenger Trolox, was able to prevent effects linked to proteasome inhibition, such as protein stabilization, apoptosis and accumulation of ubiquitin conjugates. These observations suggest that NAC has a dual activity as an inhibitor of ROS and proteasome inhibitors. Recently, NAC was used as a ROS inhibitor to functionally characterize a novel anticancer compound, piperlongumine, leading to its description as a ROS inducer. In contrast, our own experiments showed that this compound depicts features of proteasome inhibitors including suppression of FOXM1 (Forkhead box protein M1), stabilization of cellular proteins, induction of ROS-independent apoptosis and enhanced accumulation of ubiquitin conjugates. In addition, NAC, but not catalase or Trolox, interfered with the activity of piperlongumine, further supporting that piperlongumine is a proteasome inhibitor. Most importantly, we showed that NAC, but not other ROS scavengers, directly binds to proteasome inhibitors. To our knowledge, NAC is the first known compound that directly interacts with and antagonizes the activity of proteasome inhibitors. Taken together, the findings of the present study suggest that, as a result of the dual nature of NAC, data interpretation might not be straightforward when NAC is utilized as an antioxidant to demonstrate ROS involvement in drug-induced apoptosis. The most commonly used chemopreventive agents in the prevention of oral leukoplakia, head and neck cancer, and lung cancer are beta-carotene, vitamin A, and other retinoids. One of the few chemopreventive agents not in this group and presently being used in a clinical trial is N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC). NAC, an antioxidant, is used in EUROSCAN, a European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) chemoprevention study in curatively treated patients with oral, laryngeal, or lung cancer. The rationale for choosing NAC is based on a variety of experimental data showing its ability to exert protective effects, including extracellular inhibition of mutagenic agents from exogenous and endogenous sources, inhibition of genotoxicity of reactive oxygen species, modulation of metabolism coordinated with blocking of reactive metabolites, protection of DNA and nuclear enzymes, and prevention of the formation of carcinogen-DNA adducts. NAC has also demonstrated an effect on mutagen-induced chromosomal sensitivity assays, and on anticarcinogenicity in experimental animal models. In addition, preliminary data from EUROSCAN show good compliance in treated patients and a low frequency of side effects.

2226.0	('S-adenosyl-l-methionine', 'S-adenosylmethionine', 'Ademetionine', 'Same', 'Adomet')	mouse	"S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM), also known under the commercial names of SAMe, SAM-e, or AdoMet, is a common cosubstrate involved in methyl group transfers, transsulfuration, and aminopropylation. Although these anabolic reactions occur throughout the body, most SAM is produced and consumed in the liver. More than 40 methyl transfers from SAM are known, to various substrates such as nucleic acids, proteins, lipids and secondary metabolites. It is made from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and methionine by methionine adenosyltransferase. SAM was first discovered by Giulio Cantoni in 1952. In bacteria, SAM is bound by the SAM riboswitch, which regulates genes involved in methionine or cysteine biosynthesis. In eukaryotic cells, SAM serves as a regulator of a variety of processes including DNA, tRNA, and rRNA methylation; immune response; amino acid metabolism; transsulfuration; and more. In plants, SAM is crucial to the biosynthesis of ethylene, an important plant hormone and signaling molecule. == Structure == S-Adenosyl methionine consists of the adenosyl group attached to the sulfur of methionine, providing it with a positive charge. It is synthesized from ATP and methionine by S-Adenosylmethionine synthetase enzyme through the following reaction: ATP + L-methionine + H2O ⇌ {\displaystyle \rightleftharpoons } phosphate + diphosphate + S-adenosyl-L-methionine The sulfonium functional group present in S-adenosyl methionine is the center of its peculiar reactivity. Depending on the enzyme, S-adenosyl methionine can be converted into one of three products: adenosyl radical, which converts to deoxyadenosine (AdO): classic rSAM reaction, also cogenerates methionine S-adenosyl homocysteine, releasing methyl radical methylthioadenosine (SMT), homoalanine radical == Biochemistry == === SAM cycle === The reactions that produce, consume, and regenerate SAM are called the SAM cycle. In the first step of this cycle, the SAM-dependent methylases (EC 2.1.1) that use SAM as a substrate produce S-adenosyl homocysteine as a product. S-Adenosyl homocysteine is a strong negative regulator of nearly all SAM-dependent methylases despite their biological diversity. This is hydrolysed to homocysteine and adenosine by S-adenosylhomocysteine hydrolase EC 3.3.1.1 and the homocysteine recycled back to methionine through transfer of a methyl group from 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, by one of the two classes of methionine synthases (i.e. cobalamin-dependent (EC 2.1.1.13) or cobalamin-independent (EC 2.1.1.14)). This methionine can then be converted back to SAM, completing the cycle. In the rate-limiting step of the SAM cycle, MTHFR (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase) irreversibly reduces 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. === Radical SAM enzymes === A large number of enzymes cleave SAM reductively to produce radicals: 5′-deoxyadenosyl 5′-radical, methyl radical, and others. These enzymes are called radical SAMs. They all feature iron-sulfur cluster at their active sites. Most enzymes with this capability share a region of sequence homology that includes the motif CxxxCxxC or a close variant. This sequence provides three cysteinyl thiolate ligands that bind to three of the four metals in the 4Fe-4S cluster. The fourth Fe binds the SAM. The radical intermediates generated by these enzymes perform a wide variety of unusual chemical reactions. Examples of radical SAM enzymes include spore photoproduct lyase, activases of pyruvate formate lyase and anaerobic sulfatases, lysine 2,3-aminomutase, and various enzymes of cofactor biosynthesis, peptide modification, metalloprotein cluster formation, tRNA modification, lipid metabolism, etc. Some radical SAM enzymes use a second SAM as a methyl donor. Radical SAM enzymes are much more abundant in anaerobic bacteria than in aerobic organisms. They can be found in all domains of life and are largely unexplored. A recent bioinformatics study concluded that this family of enzymes includes at least 114,000 sequences including 65 unique reactions. Deficiencies in radical SAM enzymes have been associated with a variety of diseases including congenital heart disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and increased viral susceptibility. === Polyamine biosynthesis === Another major role of SAM is in polyamine biosynthesis. Here, SAM is decarboxylated by adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.50) to form S-adenosylmethioninamine. This compound then donates its n-propylamine group in the biosynthesis of polyamines such as spermidine and spermine from putrescine. SAM is required for cellular growth and repair. It is also involved in the biosynthesis of several hormones and neurotransmitters that affect mood, such as epinephrine. Methyltransferases are also responsible for the addition of methyl groups to the 2′ hydroxyls of the first and second nucleotides next to the 5′ cap in messenger RNA. == Therapeutic uses == === Osteoarthrtitis pain === As of 2012, the evidence was inconclusive as to whether SAM can mitigate the pain of osteoarthritis; clinical trials that had been conducted were too small from which to generalize. === Liver disease === The SAM cycle has been closely tied to the liver since 1947 because people with alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver would accumulate large amounts of methionine in their blood. While multiple lines of evidence from laboratory tests on cells and animal models suggest that SAM might be useful to treat various liver diseases, as of 2012 SAM had not been studied in any large randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials that would allow an assessment of its efficacy and safety. === Depression === A 2016 Cochrane review concluded that for major depressive disorder, ""Given the absence of high quality evidence and the inability to draw firm conclusions based on that evidence, the use of SAMe for the treatment of depression in adults should be investigated further."" A 2020 systematic review found that it performed significantly better than placebo, and had similar outcomes to other commonly used antidepressants (imipramine and escitalopram). === Anti-cancer treatment === SAM has recently been shown to play a role in epigenetic regulation. DNA methylation is a key regulator in epigenetic modification during mammalian cell development and differentiation. In mouse models, excess levels of SAM have been implicated in erroneous methylation patterns associated with diabetic neuropathy. SAM serves as the methyl donor in cytosine methylation, which is a key epigenetic regulatory process. Because of this impact on epigenetic regulation, SAM has been tested as an anti-cancer treatment. In many cancers, proliferation is dependent on having low levels of DNA methylation. In vitro addition in such cancers has been shown to remethylate oncogene promoter sequences and decrease the production of proto-oncogenes. In cancers such as colorectal cancer, aberrant global hypermethylation can inhibit promoter regions of tumor-suppressing genes. Contrary to the former information, colorectal cancers (CRCs) are characterized by global hypomethylation and promoter-specific DNA methylation. == Pharmacokinetics == Oral SAM achieves peak plasma concentrations three to five hours after ingestion of an enteric-coated tablet (400–1000 mg). The half-life is about 100 minutes. == Availability in different countries == In Canada, the UK, and the United States, SAM is sold as a dietary supplement under the marketing name SAM-e (also spelled SAME or SAMe). It was introduced in the US in 1999, after the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act was passed in 1994. It was introduced as a prescription drug in Italy in 1979, in Spain in 1985, and in Germany in 1989. As of 2012, it was sold as a prescription drug in Russia, India, China, Italy, Germany, Vietnam, and Mexico. == Adverse effects == Gastrointestinal disorder, dyspepsia and anxiety can occur with SAM consumption. Long-term effects are unknown. SAM is a weak DNA-alkylating agent. Another reported side effect of SAM is insomnia; therefore, the supplement is often taken in the morning. Other reports of mild side effects include lack of appetite, constipation, nausea, dry mouth, sweating, and anxiety/nervousness, but in placebo-controlled studies, these side effects occur at about the same incidence in the placebo groups. === Interactions and contraindications === Taking SAM at the same time as some drugs may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome, a potentially dangerous condition caused by having too much serotonin. These drugs include, but are certainly not limited to, dextromethorphan (Robitussin), meperidine (Demerol), pentazocine (Talwin), and tramadol (Ultram). SAM can also interact with many antidepressant medications — including tryptophan and the herbal medicine Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort) — increasing the potential for serotonin syndrome or other side effects, and may reduce the effectiveness of levodopa for Parkinson's disease. SAM can increase the risk of manic episodes in people who have bipolar disorder. === Toxicity === A 2022 study concluded that SAMe could be toxic. Jean-Michel Fustin of Manchester University said that the researchers found that excess SAMe breaks down into adenine and methylthioadenosine in the body, both producing the paradoxical effect of inhibiting methylation. This was found in laboratory mice, causing harm to health, and in in vitro tests on human cells. == See also == DNA methyltransferase SAM-I riboswitch SAM-II riboswitch SAM-III riboswitch SAM-IV riboswitch SAM-V riboswitch SAM-VI riboswitch List of investigational antidepressants == References == == External links == EINECS number 249-946-8 Shippy, R Andrew; Mendez, Douglas; Jones, Kristina; Cergnul, Irene; Karpiak, Stephen E (2004).

54673.0	('Acar 8:0', 'Car 8:0', '(3-carboxy-2-octanoyloxypropyl)-trimethylazanium', 'Octanoylcarnitine', 'O-octanoylcarnitine')	mouse	 Central retinal artery occlusion (CRAO) is a kind of ophthalmic emergency which may cause loss of functional visual acuity. However, the limited treatment options emphasize the significance of early disease prevention. Metabolomics has the potential to be a powerful tool for early identification of individuals at risk of CRAO. The aim of the study was to identify potential biomarkers for CRAO through a comprehensive analysis. We employed metabolomics analysis to compare venous blood samples from CRAO patients with cataract patients for the venous difference, as well as arterial and venous blood from CRAO patients for the arteriovenous difference. The analysis of metabolites showed that PC(P-18:0/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)), PC(P-18:0/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)) and octanoylcarnitine were strongly correlated with CRAO. We also used univariate logistic regression, random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) to screen clinical parameters of patients and found that HDL-C and ApoA1 showed significant predictive efficacy in CRAO patients. We compared the predictive performance of the clinical parameter model with combined model. The prediction efficiency of the combined model was significantly better with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.815. Decision curve analysis (DCA) also exhibited a notably higher net benefit rate. These results underscored the potency of these three substances as robust predictors of CRAO occurrence. 1 (+)-Octanoylcarnitine, a potent inhibitor of fatty acid oxidation, was infused intraportally into rabbits after 70% hepatectomy, and its effects on the rate of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis were examined. 2. The rate of DNA synthesis was markedly enhanced 48 h after hepatectomy. At this time, synthesis was decreased significantly by (+)-octanoylcarnitine. 3. It is suggested that fatty acid oxidation contributes to enhanced hepatic regeneration by elevating the decreased energy charge level [(ATP + 0.5ADP)/(ATP + ADP + AMP)] of the remnant liver. Existing data on the association between being overweight and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality risk in adults are inconsistent. We prospectively and longitudinally investigated the effects of weight on arterial stiffness and plasma metabolites in middle-aged subjects (aged 40-55 years). A group of 59 individuals who remained within the range of overweight during repeated measurements over a 3-year period was compared with a control group of 59 normal weight subjects who were matched for age and gender. Changes in metabolites by UPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometry and changes in brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (ba-PWV) were examined. At baseline, the overweight group showed higher BMI, waist circumference, triglyceride, free fatty acid (FFA), glucose, insulin, and hs-CRP, and lower HDL-cholesterol than controls. After 3 years, the changes in waist circumference, diastolic and systolic blood pressure (DBP and SBP), triglyceride, FFA, glucose, insulin, hs-CRP, and ba-PWV observed in the overweight group were significantly different from those in the control group after adjusting for baseline levels. Furthermore, the overweight group showed greater increases in L-octanoylcarnitine (q=0.006) and decanoylcarnitine (q=0.007), and higher peak intensities of L-leucine, L-octanoylcarnitine, and decanoylcarnitine. Multiple linear regression analysis showed that the change in ba-PWV was independently and positively associated with changes in L-octanoylcarnitine, lactosylceramide, and SBP, and with baseline BMI. Our results indicate that the duration of overweight is an important aggravating factor for arterial stiffness, especially during middle age. Additionally, an age-related increase in plasma L-octanoylcarnitine, lactosylceramide, SBP, and baseline BMI are independent predictors of increased arterial stiffness in middle-aged individuals.

32359.0	('Hyflavin', 'Riboflavin (b2)', 'Dermadram', 'Fiboflavin', 'Aqua-flave')	mouse	"Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is a vitamin found in food and sold as a dietary supplement. It is essential to the formation of two major coenzymes, flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide. These coenzymes are involved in energy metabolism, cellular respiration, and antibody production, as well as normal growth and development. The coenzymes are also required for the metabolism of niacin, vitamin B6, and folate. Riboflavin is prescribed to treat corneal thinning, and taken orally, may reduce the incidence of migraine headaches in adults. Riboflavin deficiency is rare and is usually accompanied by deficiencies of other vitamins and nutrients. It may be prevented or treated by oral supplements or by injections. As a water-soluble vitamin, any riboflavin consumed in excess of nutritional requirements is not stored; it is either not absorbed or is absorbed and quickly excreted in urine, causing the urine to have a bright yellow tint. Natural sources of riboflavin include meat, fish and fowl, eggs, dairy products, green vegetables, mushrooms, and almonds. Some countries require its addition to grains. In its purified, solid form, it is a water-soluble yellow-orange crystalline powder. In addition to its function as a vitamin, it is used as a food coloring agent. Biosynthesis takes place in bacteria, fungi and plants, but not animals. Industrial synthesis of riboflavin was initially achieved using a chemical process, but current commercial manufacturing relies on fermentation methods using strains of fungi and genetically modified bacteria. == Definition == Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is a water-soluble vitamin and is one of the B vitamins. Unlike folate and vitamin B6, which occur in several chemically related forms known as vitamers, riboflavin is only one chemical compound. It is a starting compound in the synthesis of the coenzymes flavin mononucleotide (FMN, also known as riboflavin-5'-phosphate) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). FAD is the more abundant form of flavin, reported to bind to 75% of the number of flavin-dependent protein encoded genes in the all-species genome (the flavoproteome) and serves as a co-enzyme for 84% of human-encoded flavoproteins. In its purified, solid form, riboflavin is a yellow-orange crystalline powder with a slight odor and bitter taste. It is soluble in polar solvents, such as water and aqueous sodium chloride solutions, and slightly soluble in alcohols. It is not soluble in non-polar or weakly polar organic solvents such as chloroform, benzene or acetone. In solution or during dry storage as a powder, riboflavin is heat stable if not exposed to light. When heated to decompose, it releases toxic fumes containing nitric oxide. == Functions == Riboflavin is essential to the formation of two major coenzymes, FMN and FAD. These coenzymes are involved in energy metabolism, cell respiration, antibody production, growth and development. Riboflavin is essential for the metabolism of carbohydrates, protein and fats. FAD contributes to the conversion of tryptophan to niacin (vitamin B3) and the conversion of vitamin B6 to the coenzyme pyridoxal 5'-phosphate requires FMN. Riboflavin is involved in maintaining normal circulating levels of homocysteine; in riboflavin deficiency, homocysteine levels increase, elevating the risk of cardiovascular diseases. === Redox reactions === Redox reactions are processes that involve the transfer of electrons. The flavin coenzymes support the function of roughly 70-80 flavoenzymes in humans (and hundreds more across all organisms, including those encoded by archeal, bacterial and fungal genomes) that are responsible for one- or two-electron redox reactions which capitalize on the ability of flavins to be converted between oxidized, half-reduced and fully reduced forms. FAD is also required for the activity of glutathione reductase, an essential enzyme in the formation of the endogenous antioxidant, glutathione. === Micronutrient metabolism === Riboflavin, FMN, and FAD are involved in the metabolism of niacin, vitamin B6, and folate. The synthesis of the niacin-containing coenzymes, NAD and NADP, from tryptophan involves the FAD-dependent enzyme, kynurenine 3-monooxygenase. Dietary deficiency of riboflavin can decrease the production of NAD and NADP, thereby promoting niacin deficiency. Conversion of vitamin B6 to its coenzyme, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, involves the enzyme, pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase, which requires FMN. An enzyme involved in folate metabolism, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, requires FAD to form the amino acid, methionine, from homocysteine. Riboflavin deficiency appears to impair the metabolism of the dietary mineral, iron, which is essential to the production of hemoglobin and red blood cells. Alleviating riboflavin deficiency in people who are deficient in both riboflavin and iron improves the effectiveness of iron supplementation for treating iron-deficiency anemia. == Synthesis == === Biosynthesis === Biosynthesis takes place in bacteria, fungi and plants, but not animals. The biosynthetic precursors to riboflavin are ribulose 5-phosphate and guanosine triphosphate. The former is converted to L-3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate while the latter is transformed in a series of reactions that lead to 5-amino-6-(D-ribitylamino)uracil. These two compounds are then the substrates for the penultimate step in the pathway, catalysed by the enzyme lumazine synthase in reaction EC 2.5.1.78. In the final step of the biosynthesis, two molecules of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine are combined by the enzyme riboflavin synthase in a dismutation reaction. This generates one molecule of riboflavin and one of 5-amino-6-(D-ribitylamino) uracil. The latter is recycled to the previous reaction in the sequence. Conversions of riboflavin to the cofactors FMN and FAD are carried out by the enzymes riboflavin kinase and FAD synthetase acting sequentially. === Industrial synthesis === The industrial-scale production of riboflavin uses various microorganisms, including filamentous fungi such as Ashbya gossypii, Candida famata and Candida flaveri, as well as the bacteria Corynebacterium ammoniagenes and Bacillus subtilis. B. subtilis that has been genetically modified to both increase the production of riboflavin and to introduce an antibiotic (ampicillin) resistance marker, is employed at a commercial scale to produce riboflavin for feed and food fortification. By 2012, over 4,000 tonnes per annum were produced by such fermentation processes. In the presence of high concentrations of hydrocarbons or aromatic compounds, some bacteria overproduce riboflavin, possibly as a protective mechanism. One such organism is Micrococcus luteus (American Type Culture Collection strain number ATCC 49442), which develops a yellow color due to production of riboflavin while growing on pyridine, but not when grown on other substrates, such as succinic acid. === Laboratory synthesis === The first total synthesis of riboflavin was carried out by Richard Kuhn's group. A substituted aniline, produced by reductive amination using D-ribose, was condensed with alloxan in the final step: == Uses == === Treatment of corneal thinning === Keratoconus is the most common form of corneal ectasia, a progressive thinning of the cornea. The condition is treated by corneal collagen cross-linking, which increases corneal stiffness. Cross-linking is achieved by applying a topical riboflavin solution to the cornea, which is then exposed to ultraviolet A light. === Migraine prevention === In its 2012 guidelines, the American Academy of Neurology stated that high-dose riboflavin (400 mg) is ""probably effective and should be considered for migraine prevention,"" a recommendation also provided by the UK National Migraine Centre. A 2017 review reported that daily riboflavin taken at 400 mg per day for at least three months may reduce the frequency of migraine headaches in adults. Research on high-dose riboflavin for migraine prevention or treatment in children and adolescents is inconclusive, and so supplements are not recommended. === Food coloring === Riboflavin is used as a food coloring (yellow-orange crystalline powder), and is designated with the E number, E101, in Europe for use as a food additive. == Dietary recommendations == The National Academy of Medicine updated the Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for riboflavin in 1998. The EARs for riboflavin for women and men aged 14 and over are 0.9 mg/day and 1.1 mg/day, respectively; the RDAs are 1.1 and 1.3 mg/day, respectively. RDAs are higher than EARs to provide adequate intake levels for individuals with higher than average requirements. The RDA during pregnancy is 1.4 mg/day and the RDA for lactating females is 1.6 mg/day. For infants up to the age of 12 months, the Adequate Intake (AI) is 0.3–0.4 mg/day and for children aged 1–13 years the RDA increases with age from 0.5 to 0.9 mg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of riboflavin there is no UL, as there is no human data for adverse effects from high doses. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL are defined the same as in United States. For women and men aged 15 and older the PRI is set at 1.6 mg/day. The PRI during pregnancy is 1.9 mg/day and the PRI for lactating females is 2.0 mg/day. For children aged 1–14 years the PRIs increase with age from 0.6 to 1.4 mg/day. These PRIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs. The EFSA also considered the maximum safe intake and like the U.S. National Academy of Medicine, decided that there was not sufficient information to set an UL. === Safety === In humans, there is no evidence for riboflavin toxicity produced by excessive intakes and absorption becomes less efficient as dosage increases. Any excess riboflavin is excreted via the kidneys into urine, resulting in a bright yellow color known as flavinuria. During a clinical trial on the effectiveness of riboflavin for treating the frequency and severity of migraines, subjects were given up to 400 mg of riboflavin orally per day for periods of 3–12 months. Abdominal pains and diarrhea were among the side effects reported. === Labeling === For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For riboflavin labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 1.7 mg, but as of May 27, 2016, it was revised to 1.3 mg to bring it into agreement with the RDA. A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at Reference Daily Intake. == Sources == The United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service maintains a food composition database from which riboflavin content in hundreds of foods can be searched. The white flour produced after milling of wheat has only 67% of its original riboflavin amount left, so white flour is enriched in some countries. Riboflavin is also added to ready-to-eat breakfast cereals. It is difficult to incorporate riboflavin into liquid products because it has poor solubility in water, hence the requirement for riboflavin-5'-phosphate (FMN, also called E101 when used as colorant), a more soluble form of riboflavin. The enrichment of bread and ready-to-eat breakfast cereals contributes significantly to the dietary supply of the vitamin. Free riboflavin is naturally present in animal-sourced foods along with protein-bound FMN and FAD. Cows' milk contains mainly free riboflavin, but both FMN and FAD are present at low concentrations. === Fortification === Some countries require or recommend fortification of grain foods. As of 2024, 57 countries, mostly in North and South America and southeast Africa, require food fortification of wheat flour or maize (corn) flour with riboflavin or riboflavin-5'-phosphate sodium. The amounts stipulated range from 1.3 to 5.75 mg/kg. An additional 16 countries have a voluntary fortification program. For example, the Indian government recommends 4.0 mg/kg for ""maida"" (white) and ""atta"" (whole wheat) flour. == Absorption, metabolism, excretion == More than 90% of riboflavin in the diet is in the form of protein-bound FMN and FAD. Exposure to gastric acid in the stomach releases the coenzymes, which are subsequently enzymatically hydrolyzed in the proximal small intestine to release free riboflavin. Absorption occurs via a rapid active transport system, with some additional passive diffusion occurring at high concentrations. Bile salts facilitate uptake, so absorption is improved when the vitamin is consumed with a meal. The majority of newly absorbed riboflavin is taken up by the liver on the first pass, indicating that postprandial appearance of riboflavin in blood plasma may underestimate absorption. Three riboflavin transporter proteins have been identified: RFVT1 is present in the small intestine and also in the placenta; RFVT2 is highly expressed in brain and salivary glands; and RFVT3 is most highly expressed in the small intestine, testes, and prostate. Infants with mutations in the genes encoding these transport proteins can be treated with riboflavin administered orally. Riboflavin is reversibly converted to FMN and then FAD. From riboflavin to FMN is the function of zinc-requiring riboflavin kinase; the reverse is accomplished by a phosphatase. From FMN to FAD is the function of magnesium-requiring FAD synthase; the reverse is accomplished by a pyrophosphatase. FAD appears to be an inhibitory end-product that down-regulates its own formation. When excess riboflavin is absorbed by the small intestine, it is quickly removed from the blood and excreted in urine. Urine color is used as a hydration status biomarker and, under normal conditions, correlates with urine specific gravity and urine osmolality. However, riboflavin supplementation in large excess of requirements causes urine to appear more yellow than normal. With normal dietary intake, about two-thirds of urinary output is riboflavin, the remainder having been partially metabolized to hydroxymethylriboflavin from oxidation within cells, and as other metabolites. When consumption exceeds the ability to absorb, riboflavin passes into the large intestine, where it is catabolized by bacteria to various metabolites that can be detected in feces. There is speculation that unabsorbed riboflavin could affect the large intestine microbiome. == Deficiency == === Prevalence === Riboflavin deficiency is uncommon in the United States and in other countries with wheat flour or corn meal fortification programs. From data collected in biannual surveys of the U.S. population, for ages 20 and over, 22% of women and 19% of men reported consuming a supplement that contained riboflavin, typically a vitamin-mineral multi-supplement. For the non-supplement users, the dietary intake of adult women averaged 1.74 mg/day and men 2.44 mg/day. These amounts exceed the RDAs for riboflavin of 1.1 and 1.3 mg/day respectively. For all age groups, on average, consumption from food exceeded the RDAs. A 2001-02 U.S. survey reported that less than 3% of the population consumed less than the Estimated Average Requirement of riboflavin. === Signs and symptoms === Riboflavin deficiency (also called ariboflavinosis) results in stomatitis, symptoms of which include chapped and fissured lips, inflammation of the corners of the mouth (angular stomatitis), sore throat, painful red tongue, and hair loss. The eyes can become itchy, watery, bloodshot, and sensitive to light. Riboflavin deficiency is associated with anemia. Prolonged riboflavin insufficiency may cause degeneration of the liver and nervous system. Riboflavin deficiency may increase the risk of preeclampsia in pregnant women. Deficiency of riboflavin during pregnancy can result in fetal birth defects, including heart and limb deformities. === Risk factors === People at risk of having low riboflavin levels include alcoholics, vegetarian athletes, and practitioners of veganism. Pregnant or lactating women and their infants may also be at risk, if the mother avoids meat and dairy products. Anorexia and lactose intolerance increase the risk of riboflavin deficiency. People with physically demanding lives, such as athletes and laborers, may require higher riboflavin intake. The conversion of riboflavin into FAD and FMN is impaired in people with hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, and riboflavin transporter deficiency. === Causes === Riboflavin deficiency is usually found together with other nutrient deficiencies, particularly of other water-soluble vitamins. A deficiency of riboflavin can be primary (i.e. caused by poor vitamin sources in the regular diet) or secondary, which may be a result of conditions that affect absorption in the intestine. Secondary deficiencies are typically caused by the body not being able to use the vitamin, or by an increased rate of excretion of the vitamin. Diet patterns that increase risk of deficiency include veganism and low-dairy vegetarianism. Diseases such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes may cause or exacerbate riboflavin deficiency. There are rare genetic defects that compromise riboflavin absorption, transport, metabolism or use by flavoproteins. One of these is riboflavin transporter deficiency, previously known as Brown–Vialetto–Van Laere syndrome. Variants of the genes SLC52A2 and SLC52A3 which code for transporter proteins RDVT2 and RDVT3, respectively, are defective. Infants and young children present with muscle weakness, cranial nerve deficits including hearing loss, sensory symptoms including sensory ataxia, feeding difficulties, and respiratory distress caused by a sensorimotor axonal neuropathy and cranial nerve pathology. When untreated, infants with riboflavin transporter deficiency have labored breathing and are at risk of dying in the first decade of life. Treatment with oral supplementation of high amounts of riboflavin is lifesaving. Other inborn errors of metabolism include riboflavin-responsive multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, also known as a subset of glutaric acidemia type 2, and the C677T variant of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme, which in adults has been associated with risk of high blood pressure. === Diagnosis and assessment === The assessment of riboflavin status is essential for confirming cases with non-specific symptoms whenever deficiency is suspected. Total riboflavin excretion in healthy adults with normal riboflavin intake is about 120 micrograms per day, while excretion of less than 40 micrograms per day indicates deficiency. Riboflavin excretion rates decrease as a person ages, but increase during periods of chronic stress and the use of some prescription drugs. Indicators used in humans are erythrocyte glutathione reductase (EGR), erythrocyte flavin concentration and urinary excretion. The erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity coefficient (EGRAC) provides a measure of tissue saturation and long-term riboflavin status. Results are expressed as an activity coefficient ratio, determined by enzyme activity with and without the addition of FAD to the culture medium. An EGRAC of 1.0 to 1.2 indicates that adequate amounts of riboflavin are present; 1.2 to 1.4 is considered low, greater than 1.4 indicates deficient. For the less sensitive ""erythrocyte flavin method"", values greater than 400 nmol/L are considered adequate and values below 270 nmol/L are considered deficient. Urinary excretion is expressed as nmol of riboflavin per gram of creatinine. Low is defined as in the range of 50 to 72 nmol/g. Deficient is below 50 nmol/g. Urinary excretion load tests have been used to determine dietary requirements. For adult men, as oral doses were increased from 0.5 mg to 1.1 mg, there was a modest linear increase in urinary riboflavin, reaching 100 micrograms for a subsequent 24-hour urine collection. Beyond a load dose of 1.1 mg, urinary excretion increased rapidly, so that with a dose of 2.5 mg, urinary output was 800 micrograms for a 24-hour urine collection. == History == The name ""riboflavin"" comes from ""ribose"" (the sugar whose reduced form, ribitol, forms part of its structure) and ""flavin"", the ring-moiety that imparts the yellow color to the oxidized molecule (from Latin flavus, ""yellow""). The reduced form, which occurs in metabolism along with the oxidized form, appears as orange-yellow needles or crystals. The earliest reported identification, predating any concept of vitamins as essential nutrients, was by Alexander Wynter Blyth. In 1879, Blyth isolated a water-soluble component of cows' milk whey, which he named ""lactochrome"", that fluoresced yellow-green when exposed to light. In the early 1900s, several research laboratories were investigating constituents of foods, essential to maintain growth in rats. These constituents were initially divided into fat-soluble ""vitamine"" A and water-soluble ""vitamine"" B. (The ""e"" was dropped in 1920.) Vitamin B was further thought to have two components, a heat-labile substance called B1 and a heat-stable substance called B2. Vitamin B2 was tentatively identified to be the factor necessary for preventing pellagra, but that was later confirmed to be due to niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency. The confusion was due to the fact that riboflavin (B2) deficiency causes stomatitis symptoms similar to those seen in pellagra, but without the widespread peripheral skin lesions. For this reason, early in the history of identifying riboflavin deficiency in humans the condition was sometimes called ""pellagra sine pellagra"" (pellagra without pellagra). In 1935, Paul Gyorgy, in collaboration with chemist Richard Kuhn and physician T. Wagner-Jauregg, reported that rats kept on a B2-free diet were unable to gain weight. Isolation of B2 from yeast revealed the presence of a bright yellow-green fluorescent product that restored normal growth when fed to rats. The growth restored was directly proportional to the intensity of the fluorescence. This observation enabled the researchers to develop a rapid chemical bioassay in 1933, and then isolate the factor from egg white, calling it ovoflavin. The same group then isolated the a similar preparation from whey and called it lactoflavin. In 1934, Kuhn's group identified the chemical structure of these flavins as identical, settled on ""riboflavin"" as a name, and were also able to synthesize the vitamin. Circa 1937, riboflavin was also referred to as ""Vitamin G"". In 1938, Richard Kuhn was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on vitamins, which had included B2 and B6. In 1939, it was confirmed that riboflavin is essential for human health through a clinical trial conducted by William H. Sebrell and Roy E. Butler. Women fed a diet low in riboflavin developed stomatitis and other signs of deficiency, which were reversed when treated with synthetic riboflavin. The symptoms returned when the supplements were stopped. == References =="	Hyflavin	WIKIPEDIA	('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.21474401652812958), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' END', -0.25252342224121094), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -2.1008713702030946e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -5.991464786347933e-05), (' FOOD', -1.688212614681106e-05), (',', -0.029782773926854134), (' INDUSTR', -0.281282901763916), ('IAL', 0.0)])

In this study, we performed 16S rDNA sequencing and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based nontargeted metabolomic profiling on feces of 26 untreated RA patients and 26 healthy controls. Twenty-six genera and forty-one MS2-identified metabolites were significantly altered in the RA patients.  Sepsis is commonly associated with a sudden impairment of brain function, thus leading to significant rates of illness and mortality. The objective of this research was to integrate microbiome and metabolome to reveal the mechanism of microbiota-hippocampus-metabolites axis dysfunction in a mouse model of sepsis. A mouse model of sepsis was established via cecal ligation and puncture. The potential associations between the composition of the gut microbiota and metabolites in the hippocampus of mice with sepsis were investigated by combining 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing and ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. A total of 140 differential metabolites were identified in the hippocampal tissues of mice with sepsis when compared to those of control mice. These differential metabolites in mice with sepsis were not only associated with autophagy and serotonergic synapse, but also involved in the metabolism and synthesis of numerous amino acids. At the phylum level, the abundance of  Analysis revealed a reduction in the F/B ratio in mice with sepsis, thus contributing to the disturbance of 5'-methylthioadenosine, curdione, PC (18:3(9Z,12Z,15Z)/18:0), corticosterone, ornithine, indoxylsulfuric acid and kynurenine; eventually, these changes led to hippocampus dysfunction. Our findings provide a new direction for the management of sepsis-induced hippocampus dysfunction. Fasting-induced autophagy in the intestine is beneficial for body health.

However, the limited treatment options emphasize the significance of early disease prevention. Metabolomics has the potential to be a powerful tool for early identification of individuals at risk of CRAO. The aim of the study was to identify potential biomarkers for CRAO through a comprehensive analysis. We employed metabolomics analysis to compare venous blood samples from CRAO patients with cataract patients for the venous difference, as well as arterial and venous blood from CRAO patients for the arteriovenous difference. The analysis of metabolites showed that PC(P-18:0/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)), PC(P-18:0/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)) and octanoylcarnitine were strongly correlated with CRAO. We also used univariate logistic regression, random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) to screen clinical parameters of patients and found that HDL-C and ApoA1 showed significant predictive efficacy in CRAO patients. We compared the predictive performance of the clinical parameter model with combined model. The prediction efficiency of the combined model was significantly better with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.815. Decision curve analysis (DCA) also exhibited a notably higher net benefit rate. These results underscored the potency of these three substances as robust predictors of CRAO occurrence. Infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) is a highly contagious immunosuppressive virus of chickens. Chickens acquire infection by the oral route under natural conditions. Although the histological and pathological changes after IBDV infection are well described, the alterations in serum metabolome have not been reported. In this study, SPF chickens were infected with attenuated IBDV (atIBDV) strain LM and very virulent IBDV (vvIBDV) strain LX, respectively. On the seventh day after oral infection, serum samples of experimental chickens were identified using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-MS/MS (UHPLC-MS/MS). The serum metabolic profiles were analyzed by multivariate statistical methods. KEGG enrichment analysis was performed to evaluate the dysregulated biological pathways. We identified 368 significantly altered metabolites in response to both atIBDV and vvIBDV infection. The metabolic disorder of amino acid and lipid was associated with IBDV infection, especially tryptophan, glycerophospholipid, lysine, and tyrosine metabolism. The differential metabolites enriched in the four metabolic pathways were PC(20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)/18:0), PE(16:0/18:2(9Z,12Z)), PE(16:0/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)), PE(18:0/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)), PE(18:0/20:4(8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)), PE(18:0/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)), PE(20:3(8Z,11Z,14Z)/16:0), PE(22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z)/16:0), PE-NMe(20:5(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)/18:0), PS(20:3(5Z,8Z,11Z)/18:2(9Z,12Z)), 2-aminobenzoic acid, 4-(2-aminophenyl)-2,4-dioxobutanoic acid, N-acetylserotonin, 5-hydroxyindoleacetate, indole-3-acetaldehyde, indole-3-acetate, p-coumaric acid, L-tyrosine, homovanillin, and S-glutaryldihydrolipoamide. The atIBDV and vvIBDV infection causes metabolic changes in chicken serum. The differential metabolites and dysregulated metabolic pathways reflect the host response to the IBDV infection. UPLC-Q-TOF-MS (Ultra-Performance Liquid Chromatography-Quadrupole Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry) is a high-precision, high-density technology for lipid analysis. Sensitive skin is a sub-stable condition, and it has been reported that the population of sensitive skin in China is predominantly female. Meanwhile, women with sensitive skin have different physiological parameters as well as lipid compositions at different ages. The Yellow Emperor's Classic of Internal Medicine states that the number of women's life cycles is seven, that major changes are manifested every 7 years, and that aging begins at age 35. At present, the correlation between facial lipid composition and aging indicators of sensitive skin in women aged 36-42 and 43-49 years has not been reported. This study reveals the relationship between key lipid composition of the facial skin and the aging of sensitive skin in women aged 36-42 and 43-49 years. We used UPLC-Q-TOF-MS technology to study the changes in lipid composition in the sensitive skin of woman aged 36-42 and 43-49 years, using a multi-probe adapter system with different types of skin-testing probes to test physiological parameters. Three types of multivariate data-questionnaires, physiological indicators, and lipid composition-were used together to assess differences in aging in a population of women with sensitive skin at different ages. 1. In the questionnaire part, the T1 group was more susceptible to sunburn and the T2 group was more susceptible to tanning. 2. In the physiological index part, the aging characteristics of facial skin in the T2 group were obvious, with the b-value, as well as the brown area size, being significantly higher than the T1 group, while the TWEL, sebum, R2 value, ITA value, pore count, and concentration of the red area were significantly lower than the T1 group. 3. In the lipid part, the total facial lipid content was higher in the T2 group, with a significantly higher GP lipid, and the 47 VIP lipids obtained were analyzed by ROC curves, narrowing down to six lipids, PS(2-OMe-21:0/0:0), PS(O-18:0/20:5 (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)), PA(O-16:0/20:5 (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)), PS (P-16:0/12:0, PA (O-16:0/22:2 (13Z,16Z)), and PC (19:3 (10Z,13Z,16Z)/0:0)), and all six lipids were higher in the T2 group. 4. In Spearman correlation analysis, PS(O-18:0/20:5(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)), PS(P-16:0/12:0), PS(2-OMe-21:0/0:0), PA(O-16:0/20:5(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)), and PC(19:3( 10Z,13Z,16Z)/0:0), which are five lipids and skin aging indicators (TWEL, sebum, ITA value, b-value, pore count, concentration of red area, and brown area size) were significantly correlated. Through correlation analysis, it was found that changes in the composition of skin surface lipids (SSLs) in both age groups have an important influence on facial physiological indicators (aging manifestations) and played an important role in furthering the understanding of sensitive skin aging. Therefore, these lipid components also provide theoretical support for the development of cosmetic ingredients that slow down the aging of sensitive skin.

6131.0	('Nicotinuric acid', 'Nicotinylglycine', 'Nicotinoyl-glycine', 'Nicotinoylglycine', 'N-nicotinoylglycine')	mouse	 Metabolic syndrome is a multiplex disorder and puts patients on the road to type 2 diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. However, a surrogate biomarker in plasma or urine in fully reflecting features of metabolic syndrome has not been explored. Urine metabolomics has potential utility in metabolic profiling because urine metabolites analysis reflects global outflux of metabolic change. Accordingly, we collected data on subjects (n = 99) with overweight, dyslipidemia, hypertension or impaired glucose tolerance and took a metabolomics approach to analyze the metabolites of urine revealed in metabolic syndrome by high-performance liquid chromatography-time-of-flight mass spectrometry and elicit potential biomarkers to picture metabolic syndrome. Our results revealed that the urine nicotinuric acid value of subjects with diabetes (HbA1c ≥ 6.5% or those receiving diabetes medications) (n = 25) was higher than subjects without diabetes (n = 37) (221 ± 31 vs. 152 ± 13 × 10(3) mAU, P = 0.0268). Moreover, urinary nicotinuric acid level was positively correlated with body mass index, blood pressure, total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triacylglycerol and high sensitivity C-reactive protein, but negatively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. This is the first study, to our knowledge, to propose that nicotinuric acid represents an important pathogenic mechanism in process from metabolic syndrome to diabetes and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. We report a liquid-chromatographic procedure for determining free nicotinic acid and a metabolite, nicotinuric acid, in plasma and urine. Five-tenths milliliter of urine or deproteinized plasma is evaporated and the residue analyzed isocratically by reversed-phase ion-pair chromatography, with measurement of the eluted nicotinic acid and nicotinuric acid at 254 nm. Nicotinic acid, nicotinuric acid, and the internal standard (isonicotinic acid) have retention times of 7.8, 8.4, and 6.8 min, respectively, in plasma, and 12.3, 13.1, and 10.8 min in urine, because of double column length. Day-to-day reproducibilities (CV) for nicotinic acid and nicotinuric acid within 7.5% are attainable for the concentration ranges 0.1--20 mg/liter, equivalent to 0.81--162 micromol of nicotinic acid and 0.55--11 micromol of nicotinuric acid per liter for plasma; in urine for the range 0.5--100 mg/liter, equivalent to 4--810 micromol of nicotinic acid and 2.8--555 micromol of nicotinuric acid per liter. Metabolites of nicotinic acid such as nicotinamide, N-methylnicotinamide, 2-hydroxypyridine-5-carboxylic acid, and other structurally related substances do not interfere. We tested an inexpensive controlled-release nicotinic acid product (Bronson Pharmaceuticals, LaCanada, CA) and compared it with the standard, more expensive, controlled release product, Nicobid (Rorer Pharmaceuticals), by measuring the 24 hour urinary recovery of nicotinic and nicotinuric acids from ten subjects following 500 mg oral ingestion of each product. Nicotinuric acid is the major detoxification product of nicotinic acid and may serve as a simple quantitative index of hepatic biotransformation of nicotinic acid. Although both products demonstrated controlled release profiles, the rate of appearance of nicotinic and nicotinuric acid in the urine as well as the rate of in vitro drug dissolution of the Bronson product were more rapid compared with Nicobid. Moreover, the total amounts of nicotinic acid and nicotinuric acid recovered in the urine after 24 hours were greater for the Bronson product (P less than .05). Since sustained presentation of nicotinic acid to the liver may correlate with clinical antihyperlipidemic effects, our results suggest that the Bronson product may prove to be a clinically useful preparation.

Herein, we found that LPC (17:0) reduced blood glucose and alleviated insulin resistance and related metabolic disorders in high-fat diet induced (HFD) mice through activating GLP-1 and promoting insulin secretion. Further, the LPC (17:0) was found to stimulate intestinal GPR120, GPR35 and CALCR, with potential effect on GLP-1 stimulation. The above observation revealed LPC (17:0) as an endogenous protective factor with potential role on GPCRs, and it provided theoretical support for the development of LPC (17:0) as a potent drug candidate or health food additive for insulin resistance and hyperglycemia.

10816.0	('Heparin, lithium salt', 'Cinnamylic acid', 'Kyselina skoricove', 'Acidum cinnamylicum', 'Benzenepropenoic acid')	mouse	Cinnamic acid is an organic compound with the formula C6H5-CH=CH-COOH. It is a white crystalline compound that is slightly soluble in water, and freely soluble in many organic solvents. Classified as an unsaturated carboxylic acid, it occurs naturally in a number of plants. It exists as both a cis and a trans isomer, although the latter is more common. == Occurrence and production == === Biosynthesis === Cinnamic acid is a central intermediate in the biosynthesis of a myriad of natural products including lignols (precursors to lignin and lignocellulose), flavonoids, isoflavonoids, coumarins, aurones, stilbenes, catechin, and phenylpropanoids. Its biosynthesis involves the action of the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL) on phenylalanine. === Natural occurrence === It is obtained from oil of cinnamon, or from balsams such as storax. It is also found in shea butter. Cinnamic acid has a honey-like odor; and its more volatile ethyl ester, ethyl cinnamate, is a flavor component in the essential oil of cinnamon, in which related cinnamaldehyde is the major constituent. It is also found in wood from many diverse tree species. === Synthesis === Cinnamic acid was first synthesized by the base-catalysed condensation of acetyl chloride and benzaldehyde, followed by hydrolysis of the acid chloride product. In 1890, Rainer Ludwig Claisen described the synthesis of ethyl cinnamate via the reaction of ethyl acetate with benzaldehyde in the presence of sodium as base. Another way of preparing cinnamic acid is by the Knoevenagel condensation reaction. The reactants for this are benzaldehyde and malonic acid in the presence of a weak base, followed by acid-catalyzed decarboxylation. It can also be prepared by oxidation of cinnamaldehyde, condensation of benzal chloride and sodium acetate (followed by acid hydrolysis), and the Perkin reaction. The oldest commercially used route to cinnamic acid involves the Perkin reaction, which is given in the following scheme == Metabolism == Cinnamic acid, obtained from autoxidation of cinnamaldehyde, is metabolized into sodium benzoate in the liver. == Uses == Cinnamic acid is used in flavorings, synthetic indigo, and certain pharmaceuticals. A major use is as a precursor to produce methyl cinnamate, ethyl cinnamate, and benzyl cinnamate for the perfume industry. Cinnamic acid is a precursor to the sweetener aspartame via enzyme-catalysed amination with phenylalanine. Cinnamic acid can dimerize in non-polar solvents resulting in different linear free energy relationships. == References ==	Cinnamylic acid	WIKIPEDIA	('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.011101112700998783), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -9.627176768844947e-05), (' PERSONAL', -0.07237445563077927), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.008627697825431824), (' INDUSTR', -0.004410771187394857), ('IAL', 0.0)])
2107.0	('Metformin', 'N,n-dimethylimidodicarbonimidic diamide', 'Fluamine', 'Metiguanide', 'Dimethylbiguanide')	mouse	"Metformin, sold under the brand name Glucophage, among others, is the main first-line medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, particularly in people who are overweight. It is also used in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome, and is sometimes used as an off-label adjunct to lessen the risk of metabolic syndrome in people who take antipsychotic medication. It has been shown to inhibit inflammation, and is not associated with weight gain. Metformin is taken by mouth. Metformin is generally well tolerated. Common adverse effects include diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain. It has a small risk of causing low blood sugar. High blood lactic acid level (acidosis) is a concern if the medication is used in overly large doses or prescribed in people with severe kidney problems. Metformin is a biguanide anti-hyperglycemic agent. It works by decreasing glucose production in the liver, increasing the insulin sensitivity of body tissues, and increasing GDF15 secretion, which reduces appetite and caloric intake. Metformin was first described in the scientific literature in 1922 by Emil Werner and James Bell. French physician Jean Sterne began the study in humans in the 1950s. It was introduced as a medication in France in 1957. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the second most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 86 million prescriptions. In Australia, it was one of the top 10 most prescribed medications between 2017 and 2023. == Medical uses == Metformin is used to lower the blood glucose in those with type 2 diabetes. It is also used as a second-line agent for infertility in those with polycystic ovary syndrome. === Type 2 diabetes === The American Diabetes Association and the American College of Physicians both recommend metformin as a first-line agent to treat type 2 diabetes. It is as effective as repaglinide and more effective than all other oral drugs for type 2 diabetes. ==== Efficacy ==== Treatment guidelines for major professional associations, including the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, the European Society for Cardiology, and the American Diabetes Association, describe evidence for the cardiovascular benefits of metformin as equivocal. A 2020 Cochrane systematic review did not find enough evidence of reduction of cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke when comparing metformin monotherapy to other glucose-lowering drugs, behavior change interventions, placebo or no intervention. The use of metformin reduces body weight in people with type 2 diabetes in contrast to sulfonylureas, which are associated with weight gain. Some evidence shows that metformin is associated with weight loss in obesity in the absence of diabetes. Metformin has a lower risk of hypoglycemia than the sulfonylureas, although hypoglycemia has uncommonly occurred during intense exercise, calorie deficit, or when used with other agents to lower blood glucose. Metformin modestly reduces low density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels. In individuals with prediabetes, a 2019 systematic review comparing the effects of metformin with other interventions in the reduction of risk of developing type 2 diabetes found moderate-quality evidence that metformin reduced the risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared to diet and exercise or a placebo. However, when comparing metformin to intensive diet or exercise, moderate-quality evidence was found that metformin did not reduce risk of developing type 2 diabetes and very low-quality evidence was found that adding metformin to intensive diet or exercise did not show any advantage or disadvantage in reducing risk of type 2 diabetes when compared to intensive exercise and diet alone. The same review also found one suitable trial comparing the effects of metformin and sulfonylurea in reducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in prediabetic individuals, however, this trial did not report any patient-relevant outcomes. === Polycystic ovarian syndrome === In those with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), tentative evidence shows that metformin use increases the rate of live births. This includes in those who have not been able to get pregnant with clomiphene. Metformin does not appear to change the risk of miscarriage. A number of other benefits have also been found both during pregnancy and in nonpregnant women with PCOS. In an updated Cochrane (2020) review on metformin versus placebo/no treatment before or during IVF/ICSI in women with PCOS no conclusive evidence of improved live birth rates was found. In long GnRH-agonist protocols there was uncertainty in the evidence of improved live birth rates but there could be increases in clinical pregnancy rate. In short GnRH-antagonist protocols metformin may reduce live birth rates with uncertainty on its effect on clinical pregnancy rate. Metformin may result in a reduction of OHSS but could come with a greater frequency of side effects. There was uncertainty as to metformin's impact on miscarriage. The evidence does not support general use during pregnancy for improving maternal and infant outcomes in obese women. The United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended in 2004 that women with PCOS and a body mass index above 25 be given metformin for anovulation and infertility when other therapies fail to produce results. UK and international clinical practice guidelines do not recommend metformin as a first-line treatment or do not recommend it at all, except for women with glucose intolerance. The guidelines suggest clomiphene as the first medication option and emphasize lifestyle modification independently from medical treatment. Metformin treatment decreases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in women with PCOS who exhibited impaired glucose tolerance at baseline. === Diabetes and pregnancy === A total review of metformin use during pregnancy compared to insulin alone found good short-term safety for both the mother and baby, but safety in the longer term is unclear. Several observational studies and randomized controlled trials found metformin to be as effective and safe as insulin for the management of gestational diabetes. Nonetheless, several concerns have been raised and evidence on the long-term safety of metformin for both mother and child is lacking. Compared with insulin, women with gestational diabetes treated with metformin gain less weight and are less likely to develop pre‐eclampsia during pregnancy. Babies born to women treated with metformin have less visceral fat, and this may make them less prone to insulin resistance in later life. The use of metformin for gestational diabetes resulted in smaller babies compared to treatment with insulin. However, despite initially lower birth weight, children exposed to metformin during pregnancy had accelerated growth after birth, and were heavier by mid-childhood than those exposed to insulin during pregnancy. This pattern of initial low birth weight followed by catch-up growth that surpasses comparative children has been associated with long-term cardiometabolic disease. A systematic review and meta-analysis of metformin, published in 2024, found that it is safe and effective in managing gestational diabetes or diabetes in pregnancy with no adverse impact on the mother or the child after eleven years of childbirth. === Weight change === Metformin use is typically associated with weight loss. It appears to be safe and effective in counteracting the weight gain caused by the antipsychotic medications olanzapine and clozapine. Although modest reversal of clozapine-associated weight gain is found with metformin, primary prevention of weight gain is more valuable. === Use with insulin === Metformin may reduce the insulin requirement in type 1 diabetes, albeit with an increased risk of hypoglycemia. == Contraindications == Metformin is contraindicated in people with: Severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) Known hypersensitivity to metformin Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis (from uncontrolled diabetes), with or without coma == Adverse effects == The most common adverse effect of metformin is gastrointestinal irritation, including diarrhea, cramps, nausea, vomiting, and increased flatulence. Metformin is more commonly associated with gastrointestinal adverse effects than most other antidiabetic medications. The most serious potential adverse effect of metformin is lactic acidosis; this complication is rare, and seems to be related to impaired liver or kidney function. Metformin is not approved for use in those with severe kidney disease, but may still be used at lower doses in those with kidney problems. === Gastrointestinal === Gastrointestinal upset can cause severe discomfort; it is most common when metformin is first administered, or when the dose is increased. The discomfort can often be avoided by beginning at a low dose (1.0 to 1.7 g/day) and increasing the dose gradually, but even with low doses, 5% of people may be unable to tolerate metformin. Use of slow or extended-release preparations may improve tolerability. Long-term use of metformin has been associated with increased homocysteine levels and malabsorption of vitamin B12. Higher doses and prolonged use are associated with increased incidence of vitamin B12 deficiency, and some researchers recommend screening or prevention strategies. ==== Vitamin B12 ==== Metformin treatment has been associated with reductions in vitamin B12 in certain people. Left untreated, vitamin B12 deficiencies can lead to serious health problems including neurological problems and anemia. Although more research is needed to understand the mechanisms of this association, it is suggested that people who take metformin monitor their vitamin B12 levels and if low, begin supplementation. In most cases of deficiencies if the person's deficiency can be corrected with exogenous administration of vitamin B12, they can continue their metformin treatment under the supervision of their doctor. === Lactic acidosis === Lactic acidosis rarely occurs with metformin exposure during routine medical care. Rates of metformin-associated lactic acidosis are about nine per 100,000 persons/year, which is similar to the background rate of lactic acidosis in the general population. A systematic review concluded no data exists to definitively link metformin to lactic acidosis. Metformin is generally safe in people with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease, with a proportional reduction of metformin dose according to severity of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and with periodic assessment of kidney function, (e.g., periodic plasma creatinine measurement). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends avoiding the use of metformin in more severe chronic kidney disease, below the eGFR cutoff of 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2. Lactate uptake by the liver is diminished with metformin use because lactate is a substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis, a process that metformin inhibits. In healthy individuals, this slight excess is cleared by other mechanisms (including uptake by unimpaired kidneys), and no significant elevation in blood levels of lactate occurs. Given severely impaired kidney function, clearance of metformin and lactate is reduced, increasing levels of both, and possibly causing lactic acid buildup. Because metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate, any condition that may precipitate lactic acidosis is a contraindication. Common causes include alcoholism (due to depletion of NAD+ stores), heart failure, and respiratory disease (due to inadequate tissue oxygenation); the most common cause is kidney disease. Metformin-associated lactate production may also take place in the large intestine, which could potentially contribute to lactic acidosis in those with risk factors. The clinical significance of this is unknown, though, and the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is most commonly attributed to decreased hepatic uptake rather than increased intestinal production. === Overdose === The most common symptoms following an overdose include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, tachycardia, drowsiness, and rarely, hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Treatment of metformin overdose is generally supportive, as no specific antidote is known. Extracorporeal treatments are recommended in severe overdoses. Due to metformin's low molecular weight and lack of plasma protein binding, these techniques have the benefit of removing metformin from the blood plasma, preventing further lactate overproduction. Metformin may be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to monitor therapy, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or assist in a forensic death investigation. Blood or plasma metformin concentrations are usually in a range of 1–4 mg/L in persons receiving therapeutic doses, 40–120 mg/L in victims of acute overdosage, and 80–200 mg/L in fatalities. Chromatographic techniques are commonly employed. The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is also increased by a massive overdose of metformin, although even quite large doses are often not fatal. === Interactions === The H2-receptor antagonist cimetidine causes an increase in the plasma concentration of metformin by reducing clearance of metformin by the kidneys; both metformin and cimetidine are cleared from the body by tubular secretion, and both, particularly the cationic (positively charged) form of cimetidine, may compete for the same transport mechanism. A small double-blind, randomized study found the antibiotic cephalexin to also increase metformin concentrations by a similar mechanism; theoretically, other cationic medications may produce the same effect. Metformin also interacts with anticholinergic medications, due to their effect on gastric motility. Anticholinergic drugs reduce gastric motility, prolonging the time drugs spend in the gastrointestinal tract. This impairment may lead to more metformin being absorbed than without the presence of an anticholinergic drug, thereby increasing the concentration of metformin in the plasma and increasing the risk for adverse effects. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === The molecular mechanism of metformin is not completely understood. Multiple potential mechanisms of action have been proposed: inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (complex I), activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), inhibition of glucagon-induced elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) with reduced activation of protein kinase A (PKA), complex IV–mediated inhibition of the GPD2 variant of mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (thereby reducing the contribution of glycerol to hepatic gluconeogenesis), and an effect on gut microbiota. Metformin exerts an anorexiant effect in most people, decreasing caloric intake. Metformin decreases gluconeogenesis (glucose production) in the liver. Metformin inhibits basal secretion from the pituitary gland of growth hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, and expression of proopiomelanocortin, which in part accounts for its insulin-sensitizing effect with multiple actions on tissues including the liver, skeletal muscle, endothelium, adipose tissue, and the ovaries. The average patient with type 2 diabetes has three times the normal rate of gluconeogenesis; metformin treatment reduces this by over one-third. Activation of AMPK was required for metformin's inhibitory effect on liver glucose production. AMPK is an enzyme that plays an important role in insulin signaling, whole-body energy balance, and the metabolism of glucose and fats. AMPK activation is required for an increase in the expression of small heterodimer partner, which in turn inhibited the expression of the hepatic gluconeogenic genes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase. Metformin is frequently used in research along with AICA ribonucleotide as an AMPK agonist. The mechanism by which biguanides increase the activity of AMPK remains uncertain: metformin increases the concentration of cytosolic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (as opposed to a change in total AMP or total AMP/adenosine triphosphate) which could activate AMPK allosterically at high levels; a newer theory involves binding to PEN-2. Metformin inhibits cyclic AMP production, blocking the action of glucagon, and thereby reducing fasting glucose levels. Metformin also induces a profound shift in the faecal microbial community profile in diabetic mice, and this may contribute to its mode of action possibly through an effect on glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion. In addition to suppressing hepatic glucose production, metformin increases insulin sensitivity, enhances peripheral glucose uptake (by inducing the phosphorylation of GLUT4 enhancer factor), decreases insulin-induced suppression of fatty acid oxidation, and decreases the absorption of glucose from the gastrointestinal tract. Increased peripheral use of glucose may be due to improved insulin binding to insulin receptors. The increase in insulin binding after metformin treatment has also been demonstrated in patients with type 2 diabetes. AMPK probably also plays a role in increased peripheral insulin sensitivity, as metformin administration increases AMPK activity in skeletal muscle. AMPK is known to cause GLUT4 deployment to the plasma membrane, resulting in insulin-independent glucose uptake. Some metabolic actions of metformin do appear to occur by AMPK-independent mechanisms, however, AMPK likely has a modest overall effect and its activity is not likely to directly decrease gluconeogenesis in the liver. Metformin has indirect antiandrogenic effects in women with insulin resistance, such as those with PCOS, due to its beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity. It may reduce testosterone levels in such women by as much as 50%. A Cochrane review, though, found that metformin was only slightly effective for decreasing androgen levels in women with PCOS. Metformin also has significant effects on the gut microbiome, such as its effect on increasing agmatine production by gut bacteria, but the relative importance of this mechanism compared to other mechanisms is uncertain. Due to its effect on GLUT4 and AMPK, metformin has been described as an exercise mimetic. === Pharmacokinetics === Metformin has an oral bioavailability of 50–60% under fasting conditions, and is absorbed slowly. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) are reached within 1–3 hours of taking immediate-release metformin and 4–8 hours with extended-release formulations. The plasma protein binding of metformin is negligible, as reflected by its very high apparent volume of distribution (300–1000 L after a single dose). Steady state is usually reached in 1–2 days. Metformin has acid dissociation constant values (pKa) of 2.8 and 11.5, so it exists very largely as the hydrophilic cationic species at physiological pH values. The metformin pKa values make it a stronger base than most other basic medications with less than 0.01% nonionized in blood. Furthermore, the lipid solubility of the nonionized species is slight as shown by its low logP value (log(10) of the distribution coefficient of the nonionized form between octanol and water) of −1.43. These chemical parameters indicate low lipophilicity and, consequently, rapid passive diffusion of metformin through cell membranes is unlikely. As a result of its low lipid solubility, it requires the transporter SLC22A1 for it to enter cells. The logP of metformin is less than that of phenformin (−0.84) because two methyl substituents on metformin impart lesser lipophilicity than the larger phenylethyl side chain in phenformin. More lipophilic derivatives of metformin are presently under investigation to produce prodrugs with superior oral absorption than metformin. Metformin is not metabolized. It is cleared from the body by tubular secretion and excreted unchanged in the urine; it is undetectable in blood plasma within 24 hours of a single oral dose. The average elimination half-life in plasma is 6.2 hours. Metformin is distributed to (and appears to accumulate in) red blood cells, with a much longer elimination half-life: 17.6 hours (reported as ranging from 18.5 to 31.5 hours in a single-dose study of nondiabetics). Some evidence indicates that liver concentrations of metformin in humans may be two to three times higher than plasma concentrations, due to portal vein absorption and first-pass uptake by the liver in oral administration. == Chemistry == Metformin hydrochloride (1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride) is freely soluble in water, slightly soluble in ethanol, but almost insoluble in acetone, ether, or chloroform. The pKa of metformin is 12.4. The usual synthesis of metformin, originally described in 1922, involves the one-pot reaction of dimethylamine hydrochloride and 2-cyanoguanidine overheat. According to the procedure described in the 1975 Aron patent, and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Encyclopedia, equimolar amounts of dimethylamine and 2-cyanoguanidine are dissolved in toluene with cooling to make a concentrated solution, and an equimolar amount of hydrogen chloride is slowly added. The mixture begins to boil on its own, and after cooling, metformin hydrochloride precipitates with a 96% yield. === Impurities === In December 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that it learned that some metformin medicines manufactured outside the United States might contain a nitrosamine impurity called N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), classified as a probable human carcinogen, at low levels. Health Canada announced that it was assessing NDMA levels in metformin. In February 2020, the FDA found NDMA levels in some tested metformin samples that did not exceed the acceptable daily intake. In February 2020, Health Canada announced a recall of Apotex immediate-release metformin, followed in March by recalls of Ranbaxy metformin and in March by Jamp metformin. In May 2020, the FDA asked five companies to voluntarily recall their sustained-release metformin products. The five companies were not named, but they were revealed to be Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Actavis Pharma, Apotex Corp, Lupin Pharma, and Marksans Pharma Limited in a letter sent to Valisure, the pharmacy that had first alerted the FDA to this contaminant in metformin via a Citizen Petition. In June 2020, the FDA posted its laboratory results showing NDMA amounts in metformin products it tested. It found NDMA in certain lots of ER metformin and is recommending companies recall lots with levels of NDMA above the acceptable intake limit of 96 nanograms per day. The FDA is also collaborating with international regulators to share testing results for metformin. In July 2020, Lupin Pharmaceuticals pulled all lots (batches) of metformin after discovering unacceptably high levels of NDMA in tested samples. In August 2020, Bayshore Pharmaceuticals recalled two lots of tablets. The FDA issued revised guidelines about nitrosamine impurities in September 2024. == History == The biguanide class of antidiabetic medications, which also includes the withdrawn agents phenformin and buformin, originates from the plant Goat's rue (Galega officinalis) also known as Galega, French lilac, Italian fitch, Spanish sainfoin, Pestilenzkraut, or Professor-weed. (The plant should not be confused with plants in the genus Tephrosia which are highly toxic and sometimes also called Goat's rue.) Galega officinalis has been used in folk medicine for several centuries. G. officinalis itself does not contain biguanide medications which are chemically synthesized compounds composed of two guanidine molecules and designed to be less toxic than the plant-derived parent compounds guanidine and galegine (isoamylene guanidine). Metformin was first described in the scientific literature in 1922, by Emil Werner and James Bell, as a product in the synthesis of N,N-dimethylguanidine. In 1929, Slotta and Tschesche discovered its sugar-lowering action in rabbits, finding it the most potent biguanide analog they studied. This result was ignored, as other guanidine analogs such as the synthalins, took over and were themselves soon overshadowed by insulin. Interest in metformin resumed at the end of the 1940s. In 1950, metformin, unlike some other similar compounds, was found not to decrease blood pressure and heart rate in animals. That year, Filipino physician Eusebio Y. Garcia used metformin (he named it Fluamine) to treat influenza; he noted the medication ""lowered the blood sugar to minimum physiological limit"" and was not toxic. Garcia believed metformin to have bacteriostatic, antiviral, antimalarial, antipyretic, and analgesic actions. In a series of articles in 1954, Polish pharmacologist Janusz Supniewski was unable to confirm most of these effects, including lowered blood sugar. Instead, he observed antiviral effects in humans. French diabetologist Jean Sterne studied the antihyperglycemic properties of galegine, an alkaloid isolated from G. officinalis, which is related in structure to metformin, and had seen brief use as an antidiabetic before the synthalins were developed. Later, working at Laboratoires Aron in Paris, he was prompted by Garcia's report to reinvestigate the blood sugar-lowering activity of metformin and several biguanide analogs. Sterne was the first to try metformin on humans for the treatment of diabetes; he coined the name ""Glucophage"" (glucose eater) for the medication and published his results in 1957. Metformin became available in the British National Formulary in 1958. It was sold in the UK by a small Aron subsidiary called Rona. Broad interest in metformin was not rekindled until the withdrawal of the other biguanides in the 1970s. Metformin was approved in Canada in 1972, but did not receive approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for type 2 diabetes until 1994. Produced under license by Bristol-Myers Squibb, Glucophage was the first branded formulation of metformin to be marketed in the U.S., beginning on 3 March 1995. Generic formulations are available in several countries. The US FDA granted the application for metformin orphan drug designation. The European Medicines Agency granted orphan drug status to metformin. == Society and culture == === Environmental impact === Metformin and its major transformation product guanylurea are present in wastewater treatment plant effluents and regularly detected in surface waters. Guanylurea concentrations above 200 μg/L have been measured in the German river Erpe, which are amongst the highest reported for pharmaceutical transformation products in aquatic environments. === Formulations === Metformin is the British Approved Name (BAN), the United States Adopted Name (USAN), and the International Nonproprietary Name (INN). It is sold under several brand names. Common brand names include Glucophage, Riomet, Fortamet, and Glumetza in the US. In other areas of the world, there is also Obimet, Gluformin, Dianben, Diabex, Diaformin, Metsol, Siofor, Metfogamma and Glifor. There are several formulations of metformin available on the market, and all but the liquid form have generic equivalents. ==== Combination with other medications ==== When used for type 2 diabetes, metformin is often prescribed in combination with other medications. Several medications are available as fixed-dose combinations, with the potential to reduce pill burden, decrease cost, and simplify administration. ===== Thiazolidinediones (glitazones) ===== ====== Rosiglitazone ====== A combination of metformin and rosiglitazone was released in 2002, and sold as Avandamet by GlaxoSmithKline, or as a generic medication. Formulations are 500/1, 500/2, 500/4, 1000/2, and 1000 mg/4 mg of metformin/rosiglitazone. In 2009, it was the most popular metformin combination. In 2005, the stock of Avandamet was removed from the market, after inspections showed the factory where it was produced was violating good manufacturing practices. The medication pair continued to be prescribed separately, and Avandamet was again available by the end of that year. A generic formulation of metformin/rosiglitazone from Teva received tentative approval from the FDA and reached the market in early 2012. However, following a meta-analysis in 2007, that linked the medication's use to an increased risk of heart attack, concerns were raised over the safety of medicines containing rosiglitazone. In September 2010, the European Medicines Agency recommended that the medication be suspended from the European market because the benefits of rosiglitazone no longer outweighed the risks. It was withdrawn from the market in the UK and India in 2010, and in New Zealand and South Africa in 2011. From November 2011 until November 2013 the FDA did not allow rosiglitazone or metformin/rosiglitazone to be sold without a prescription; moreover, makers were required to notify patients of the risks associated with its use, and the drug had to be purchased by mail order through specified pharmacies. In November 2013, the FDA lifted its earlier restrictions on rosiglitazone after reviewing the results of the 2009 RECORD clinical trial (a six-year, open-label randomized control trial), which failed to show elevated risk of heart attack or death associated with the medication. ====== Pioglitazone ====== The combination of metformin and pioglitazone (Actoplus Met, Piomet, Politor, Glubrava) is available in the US and the European Union. ===== DPP-4 inhibitors ===== Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and thus reduce glucagon and blood glucose levels. DPP-4 inhibitors combined with metformin include a sitagliptin/metformin combination (Janumet), a saxagliptin/metformin combination (Kombiglyze XR, Komboglyze), and an alogliptin/metformin combination (Kazano, Vipdomet). Linagliptin combined with metformin hydrochloride is sold under the brand name Jentadueto. As of August 2021, linagliptin/metformin is available as a generic medicine in the US. ===== SGLT2 inhibitors ===== There are combinations of metformin with the SGLT2 inhibitors dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and canagliflozin. ===== Sulfonylureas ===== Sulfonylureas act by increasing insulin release from the beta cells in the pancreas. A 2019 systematic review suggested that there is limited evidence if the combined use of metformin with sulfonylurea compared to the combination of metformin plus another glucose-lowering intervention, provides benefit or harm in mortality, severe adverse events, macrovascular and microvascular complications. Combined metformin and sulfonylurea therapy did appear to lead to a higher risk of hypoglycemia. Metformin is available combined with the sulfonylureas glipizide (Metaglip) and glibenclamide (US: glyburide) (Glucovance). Generic formulations of metformin/glipizide and metformin/glibenclamide are available (the latter is more popular). ===== Meglitinide ===== Meglitinides are similar to sulfonylureas, as they bind to beta cells in the pancreas, but differ by the site of binding to the intended receptor and the drugs' affinities to the receptor. As a result, they have a shorter duration of action compared to sulfonylureas and require higher blood glucose levels to begin to secrete insulin. Both meglitinides, known as nateglinide and repanglinide, are sold in formulations combined with metformin. A repaglinide/metformin combination is sold as Prandimet, or as its generic equivalent. ===== Triple combination ===== The combination of metformin with dapagliflozin and saxagliptin is available in the United States as Qternmet XR. The combination of metformin with pioglitazone and glibenclamide is available in India as Accuglim-MP, Adglim MP, and Alnamet-GP; and in the Philippines as Tri-Senza. The combination of metformin with pioglitazone and lipoic acid is available in Turkey as Pional. == Research == Metformin is a pleiotropic drug, with extensive off-target activity beyond its antidiabetic effect. Much of this has been attributed to its action on AMPK, although other mechanisms have been proposed. Metformin has been studied for its effects on multiple other conditions, including: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease Premature puberty Cancer Cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes Aging === Aging and life extension === No evidence shows that metformin extends the human lifespan. Despite that, metformin has received substantial interest as an agent that delays aging; it has been shown to increase longevity in some animal models (e.g., C. elegans and crickets). This effect may be mediated by insulin and carbohydrate regulation, similar to its effects on diabetes. Whether metformin may help extend life, even in otherwise healthy people, remains unknown; a 2021 review of the literature found it is likely to improve healthspan, i.e., the number of years spent in good health, rather than lifespan overall. A 2017 review found that people with diabetes who were taking metformin had lower all-cause mortality. They also had reduced cancer and cardiovascular disease compared with those on other therapies. In people without diabetes, metformin does not appear to reduce the risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease. === Cancer === The potential anticancer effects of metformin are believed to be mediated through multiple pathways, particularly involving AMPK activation and IGF-1R modulation. Research has focused particularly on stomach cancer, with evidence of protective impact (reducing the risk of cancer) and improving survival rates among patients in whom cancer has already developed. Despite promising findings, evidence is still preliminary and there is no consensus on its preventive and therapeutic role. === COVID-19 === A study found a benefit using metformin to reduce the occurrence of long COVID. It is unclear if there is a reduced risk of death using metformin to treat people with COVID-19. === Neurological and neurodegenerative disorders === There has been extensive research into the potential neuroprotective effects of metformin in developmental and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, certain types of epilepsy, and fragile X syndrome, with mixed results. Preliminary studies have examined whether metformin can reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and whether there is a correlation between type 2 diabetes and the risk of Alzheimer's disease. While metformin may reduce body weight in persons with fragile X syndrome, whether it improves neurological or psychiatric symptoms is uncertain. === Derivatives === A derivative HL156A, also known as IM156, is a potential new drug for medical use. == References == == Further reading == == External links == ""Nitrosamine impurities in medications: Guidance"".

It is a common metabolite that occurs naturally in human urine. The highly-nitrogenous compound is most commonly encountered in human subjects with urea cycle disorders,. These conditions, such as uremia or hyperammonemia, tend to cause high levels of nitrogen in the form of ammonia in the blood. Uremic conditions are a result of defects in enzymes that convert ammonia to urea, the primary nitrogenous waste metabolite in the urea cycle. == Metabolism == Phenylacetylglutamine is the primary metabolite of the degradation of phenylacetate when in the presence of glutamine in the liver. It is also produced in higher concentrations in the body through the metabolic degradation pathway of the pharmaceutical compounds sodium phenylbutyrate, glycerol phenylbutyrate, and sodium phenylacetate, considered more toxic, that are used as treatments for the physiological dysfunction in urea cycling. Phenylbutyrate is beta-oxidized into phenylacetate which is conjugated with glutamine in the liver and excreted by the kidney. Phenylacetylglutamine is the product of uremic conditions that require an alternative pathway to the urea cycle for nitrogen waste removal. This process produces comparable levels of phenylacetylglutamine in urine in relation to urea levels in a properly functioning urea cycle. In 24 hours 80-100% of a dose of phenylbutyrate is excreted in the urine as phenylacetylglutamine. The metabolism and conjugation of phenylacetate with glutamine in the liver involves amino acid acetylation carried out by the enzyme phenylacetyltranferase or glutamine N-acetyl transferase. The enzyme catalyzes the reaction of the substrates phenylacetyl-CoA and L-glutamine to produce CoA and alpha-N-phenylacetyl-L-glutamine and phenylacetic acid. The catalytic enzyme has been isolated in the human liver mitochondria. Furthermore, phenylacetylglutamine has been found in human urine, but not in the excretory material of rats, dogs, cats, monkeys, sheep, or horses. Throughout the metabolic process, phenylacetylglutamine is bound and conjugated by free-plasma in the kidney to remove excess nitrogen through its excretion in the urine. == As a biomarker == Elevated levels of nitrogen in the blood increase the amount of glutamine, the primary, non-toxic carrier of ammonia in the blood, within patients with hyperammonemia and inborn errors in urea synthesis. Phenylacetylglutamine levels in the urine serves as a more effective biomarker for the excretion of nitrogenous waste than measures of blood plasma, which fluctuate and are a less effective therapeutic monitor of waste nitrogen levels. A 24-hour metabolic urine test of phenylacetylglutamine provides a non-invasive biomarker of waste nitrogen that most consistently reflects the dose of phenylbutyric acid or glycerol phenylbutyrate used to treat patients with urea-cycle disorders. Phenylacetylglutamine isotopically labeled with 14C also serves more broadly to characterize relative rates of cellular reactions and functions as a general, non-invasive biomarker for gluconeogenesis and citric acid cycle intermediates in the liver. == Chronic kidney disorder == High levels of phenylacetylglutamine in the urine following metabolism by the gut microbiota may also indicate early renal decline associated with kidney dysfunction and chronic kidney disease (CKD). In CKD, phenylacetylglutamine is considered a uremic toxin which is taken up, circulated and retained in the blood after microbial fermentation of certain proteins and amino acids in the gut. Blood serum levels of phenylacetylglutamine in CKD are used as a mortality determinant. Blood plasma levels of phenylacetylglutamine increase with exposure to cigarette smoke, in patients with ischemic heart failure, with cardiovascular risk or hypertension, in the development of renal disease, and in patients with type 2 diabetes. == See also == Glycerol phenylbutyrate Sodium phenylacetate Sodium phenylbutyrate == References ==	Phenylacetylglutamine	WIKIPEDIA	('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -6.921253225300461e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.00017994173686020076), ('US', 0.0)])

MONARCH 3 is a randomized, phase III, double-blind study of abemaciclib/placebo (150 mg twice daily, continuous) plus nonsteroidal AI (1 mg anastrozole or 2.5 mg letrozole, daily). A total of 493 postmenopausal women with HR+, HER2- ABC with no prior systemic therapy in this setting were enrolled. The primary endpoint was investigator-assessed PFS (final analysis after 240 events); other endpoints included response and safety evaluations. Here we analyze the final PFS data and update secondary endpoints. The abemaciclib arm had a significantly longer median PFS than the placebo arm (28.18 versus 14.76 months; hazard ratio [95% confidence interval], 0.540 [0.418-0.698];  The phase 3 AETHERA trial established brentuximab vedotin (BV) as a consolidative treatment option for adult patients with classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) at high risk of relapse or progression after autologous hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (auto-HSCT). Results showed that BV significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) vs placebo plus best supportive care alone. At 5-year follow-up, BV continued to provide patients with sustained PFS benefit; 5-year PFS was 59% (95% confidence interval [CI], 51-66) with BV vs 41% (95% CI, 33-49) with placebo (hazard ratio [HR], 0.521; 95% CI, 0.379-0.717). Similarly, patients with ≥2 risk factors in the BV arm experienced significantly higher PFS at 5 years than patients in the placebo arm (HR, 0.424; 95% CI, 0.302-0.596). Upfront consolidation with BV significantly delayed time to second subsequent therapy, an indicator of ongoing disease control, vs placebo. Peripheral neuropathy, the most common adverse event in patients receiving BV, continued to improve and/or resolve in 90% of patients. In summary, consolidation with BV in adult patients with cHL at high risk of relapse or progression after auto-HSCT confers a sustained PFS benefit and is safe and well tolerated.

120208.0	('Monoelaidin', 'Glyceryl monooleate', 'Isojasminin', 'Oleoyl-glycerol', 'Trans-monoelaidin')	mouse	 In recent years, lipid based nanostructures have increasingly been used as model membranes to study various complex biological processes. For better understanding of such phenomena, it is essential to gain as much information as possible for model lipid structures under physiological conditions. In this paper, we focus on one of such lipids--monoelaidin (ME)--for its polymorphic nanostructures under varying conditions of temperature and water content. In the recent contribution (Soft Matter, 2010, 6, 3191), we have reported the phase diagram of ME above 30 °C and compared with the phase behavior of other lipids including monoolein (MO), monovaccenin (MV), and monolinolein (ML). Remarkable phase behavior of ME, stabilizing three bicontinuous cubic phases, motivates its study at low temperatures. Current studies concentrate on the low-temperature (<30 °C) behavior of ME and subsequent reconstruction of its phase diagram over the entire temperature-water composition space (temperature, 0-76 °C; and water content, 0-70%). The polymorphs found for the monoelaidin-water system include three bicontinuous cubic phases, i.e., Ia3d, Pn3m, and Im3m, and lamellar phases which exhibit two crystalline (L(c1) and L(c0)), two gel (L(β) and L(β*)), and a fluid lamellar (L(α)) states. The fluid isotropic phase (L(2)) was observed only for lower hydrations (<20%), whereas hexagonal phase (H(2)) was not found under studied conditions. Nanostructural parameters of these phases as a function of temperature and water content are presented together with some molecular level calculations. This study might be crucial for perception of the lyotropic phase behavior as well as for designing nanostructural assemblies for potential applications. We used x-ray and neutron diffraction to study the temperature- and pressure-dependent structure and phase behavior of the monoacylglycerides 1-monoelaidin (ME) and 1-monoolein (MO) in excess water. The monoacylglycerides were chosen for investigation of their phase behavior because they exhibit mesomorphic phases with one-, two-, and three-dimensional periodicity, such as lamellar, an inverted hexagonal and bicontinuous cubic phases, in a rather easily accessible temperature and pressure range. We studied the structure, stability, and transformations of the different phases over a wide temperature and pressure range, explored the epitaxial relations that exist between different phases, and established a relationship between the chemical structure of the lipid molecules and their phase behavior. For both systems, a temperature-pressure phase diagram has been determined in the temperature range from 0 to 100 degrees C at pressures from ambient up to 1400 bar, and drastic differences in phase behavior are found for the two systems. In MO-water dispersions, the cubic phase Pn3m extends over a large phase field in the T,p-plane. At temperatures above 95 degrees C, the inverted hexagonal phase is found. In the lower temperature region, a crystalline lamellar phase is induced at higher pressures. The phases found in ME-water include the lamellar crystalline Lc phase, the L beta gel phase, the L alpha liquid-crystalline phase, and two cubic phases belonging to the crystallographic space groups Im3m and Pn3m. In addition, the existence of metastable phases has been exploited. Between coexisting metastable cubic structures, a metric relationship has been found that is predicted theoretically on the basis of the curvature elastic energy approximation only. In the present study, synchrotron small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and Cryo-TEM were used to characterize the temperature-induced structural transitions of monoelaidin (ME) aqueous dispersion in the presence of the polymeric stabilizer F127. We prove that the direct transition from vesicles to cubosomes by heating this dispersion is possible. The obtained results were compared with the fully hydrated bulk ME phase. Our results indicate the formation of ME dispersion, which is less stable than that based on the congener monoolein (MO). In addition, the temperature-dependence behavior significantly differs from the fully hydrated bulk phase. SAXS findings indicate a direct L(alpha)-V(2) internal transition in the dispersion. While the transition temperature is conserved in the dispersion, the formed cubosomes with internal Im3m symmetry clearly contain more water and this ordered interior is retained over a wider temperature range as compared to its fully hydrated bulk system. At 25 degrees C, Cryo-TEM observations reveal the formation of most likely closely packed onion-like vesicles. Above the lamellar to non-lamellar phase transition at 65 degrees C, flattened cubosomes with an internal nanostructure are observed. However, they have only arbitrary shapes and thus, their morphology is significantly different from that of the well-shaped analogous MO cubosome and hexosome particles. Our study reveals a direct liposomes-cubosomes transition in ME dispersion. The obtained results suggest that the polymeric stabilizer F127 especially plays a significant role in the membrane fusion processes. F127 incorporates in considerable amount into the internal nanostructure and leads to the formation of a highly swollen Im3m phase.	Monoelaidin	PUBMED	('INFO', [('INFO', -0.03377029672265053)])
77048.0	('Azoxystrobin', 'Amistar', 'Bankit', 'Quadris', 'Heritage')	mouse	"Azoxystrobin is a broad spectrum systemic fungicide widely used in agriculture to protect crops from fungal diseases. It was first marketed in 1996 using the brand name Amistar and by 1999 it had been registered in 48 countries on more than 50 crops. In the year 2000 it was announced that it had been granted UK Millennium product status. == History == In 1977, academic research groups in Germany published details of two new antifungal antibiotics they had isolated from the basidiomycete fungus Strobilurus tenacellus. They named these strobilurin A and B but did not provide detailed structures, only data based on their high-resolution mass spectra, which showed that the simpler of the two had molecular formula C16H18O3. In the following year, further details including structures were published and a related fungicide, oudemansin A from the fungus Oudemansiella mucida, whose identity had been determined by X-ray crystallography, was disclosed. When the fungicidal effects were shown to stem from what was then a novel mode of action, chemists at the Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) research site at Jealott's Hill became interested to use them as leads to develop new fungicides suitable for use in agriculture. The first task was to synthesize a sample of strobilurin A for testing. In doing so, it was discovered that the structure that had been published was incorrect in the stereochemistry of one of the double bonds: the strobilurins, in fact, have the E,Z,E not E,E,E configuration. Once this was realised and the correct material was made and tested it was shown, as expected, to be active in vitro but insufficiently stable to light to be active in the glasshouse. A large programme of chemistry to make analogues was begun when it was discovered that a new stilbene structure containing the β-methoxyacrylate portion (shown in blue and believed to be the toxophore) had good activity in glasshouse tests but still lacked sufficient photostability.: 695–696 After more than 1400 analogues had been made and tested the team chose azoxystrobin for commercialisation and it was developed under the code number ICIA5504. First sales were in 1996 using the brand name Amistar: it then gained fast-track registration in the United States, where it was marketed in 1997 as Heritage. By 1999 it had been registered in 48 countries on more than 50 crops. In the year 2000 it was announced that it had been granted Millennium product status by the UK Prime Minister, Tony Blair, as it had become in three years the world's best-selling fungicide. Meanwhile, BASF scientists who were collaborating with the German academic groups that had discovered strobilurin A had independently invented kresoxim-methyl, which was also launched in 1996. == Synthesis == The first synthesis of azoxystrobin was disclosed in patents filed by the ICI group. The sequence of the two substitution reactions allows for the synthesis of a diverse range of structural analogs via an Ullmann-type etherification between the aryl chloride of the first intermediate and a substituted phenol, thus introducing a range of structural diversity while maintaining the central strobin toxophore. The final choice of 2-cyano phenol in the second step of the synthesis was made after many other alternatives had been tested for their fungicidal properties.: 704 The crystal structure was published in 2008. == Mechanism of action == Azoxystrobin and other strobilurins inhibit mitochondrial respiration by blocking electron transport. They bind at the quinol outer binding site of the cytochrome b-c1 complex, where ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10) would normally bind when carrying electrons to that protein. Thus production of ATP is prevented. The generic name for this mode of action is ""Quinone Outside Inhibitors"" QoI. == Formulations == Azoxystrobin is made available to end-users only in formulated products. Since the active ingredient has moderate solubility in water, formulations aid its use in water-based sprays by creating an emulsion when diluted. Modern products use non-powdery formulations with reduced or no use of hazardous solvents, for example suspension concentrates. The fungicide is compatible with many other pesticides and adjuvants when mixed by the farmer for spraying. == Usage == Azoxystrobin is a xylem-mobile systemic fungicide with translaminar, protectant and curative properties. In cereal crops, its main outlet, the length of disease control is generally about four to six weeks during the period of active stem elongation. All pesticides are required to seek registration from appropriate authorities in the country in which they will be used. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for regulating pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and the Food Quality Protection Act (FQPA). A pesticide can only be used legally according to the directions on the label that is included at the time of the sale of the pesticide. The purpose of the label is ""to provide clear directions for effective product performance while minimizing risks to human health and the environment"". A label is a legally binding document that mandates how the pesticide can and must be used and failure to follow the label as written when using the pesticide is a federal offence. Within the European Union, a 2-tiered approach is used for the approval and authorisation of pesticides. Firstly, before a formulated product can be developed for market, the active substance must be approved for the European Union. After this has been achieved, authorisation for the specific product must be sought from every Member State that the applicant wants to sell it to. Afterwards, there is a monitoring programme to make sure the pesticide residues in food are below the limits set by the European Food Safety Authority. === Agriculture and Horticulture === Azoxystrobin possesses a broad spectrum of activity, in common with other QoI inhibitors. Examples of the fungal groups on which it is effective are Ascomycota, Deuteromycota, and Basidiomycota, as well as the oomycetes. In addition, its properties mean that it can move systemically through plant tissue to protect parts of the crop that were not in contact with the spray. This combination of properties has meant that it achieved widespread use very quickly and has reached annual sales of more than $500 million. Important diseases which it controls include leaf spot, rusts, powdery mildew, downy mildew, net blotch and blight. Worldwide, azoxystrobin is registered for use on all important crops. For example, in the European Union and United States, it is registered for use in wheat, barley, oats, rye, soya, cotton, rice, strawberry, peas, beans, onions and many other vegetables. The advantage to the farmer comes in the form of improved yield at harvest. Farmers can act in their best economic interest: the value of the additional yield can be estimated and the total cost of using the fungicide informs the decision to purchase. This cost-benefit analysis by the end user sets a maximum price which the supplier can demand and in practice pesticide prices fluctuate according to the current market value of the crops in which they are used. The estimated annual use of azoxystrobin in US agriculture is mapped by the US Geological Survey and shows an increasing trend from its introduction in 1997 to 2019, the latest date for which figures are available, and now reaching 2,300,000 pounds (1,000,000 kg). === Home and garden === One of the earliest uses of azoxystrobin was to control fungal diseases of turf and it has been used on golf courses and lawns. It is now available for domestic markets under brand names such as Heritage and Azoxy 2SC. Azoxystrobin is added to mold-resistant Purple wallboards (optiSHIELD AT, mixture of azoxystrobin and thiabendazole) and can leach into house dust, potentially providing a source of life-long exposure to children and adults. == Human safety == Azoxystrobin has little toxicity to mammals with an LD50 of over 5000 mg/kg (rats, oral). However, it can cause skin and eye irritation. First aid information is included with the label. The World Health Organization (WHO) and Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) joint meeting on pesticide residues has determined that the acceptable daily intake for azoxystrobin is 0-0.2 mg/kg bodyweight per day. The Codex Alimentarius database maintained by the FAO lists the maximum residue limits for azoxystrobin in various food products. == Effects on the environment == Azoxystrobin is categorized as having a low potential for bioconcentration and of moderate risk to fish, earthworms and bees but of high risk to aquatic crustaceans, so care must be taken to avoid runoff into water bodies. Its main degradation product, the carboxylic acid resulting from hydrolysis of its methyl ester, is also potentially harmful to aquatic environments. The benefits and risks of use of QoI fungicides have been reviewed and there is extensive literature on azoxystrobin's environmental profile. Ultimately it is the regulatory authorities in each country who must weigh up the benefits to end users and balance these against the compound's inherent hazards and consequent risks to consumers and the wider environment. == Resistance Management == Fungal populations have the ability to develop resistance to QoI inhibitors. This potential can be mitigated by careful management. Reports of individual pest species becoming resistant to azoxystrobin are monitored by manufacturers, regulatory bodies such as the EPA and the Fungicides Resistance Action Committee (FRAC), who assign fungicides into classes by mode of action. In some cases, the risks of resistance developing can be reduced by using a mixture of two or more fungicides which each have activity on relevant pests but with unrelated mechanisms of action. FRAC assigns fungicides into classes so as to facilitate this. On cereal crops in the US, for example, azoxystrobin may only be used in mixture, usually with an azole fungicide such as difenoconazole. == Brands == Azoxystrobin is the ISO common name for the active ingredient which is formulated into the branded product sold to end-users. By international convention and in many countries the law, pesticide labels are required to include the common name of the active ingredients. These names are not the exclusive property of the holder of any patent or trademark and as such they are the easiest way for non-experts to refer to individual chemicals. Companies selling pesticides normally do so using a brand name or wordmark which allows them to distinguish their product from competitor products having the same active ingredient. In many cases, this branding is country and formulation-specific so after several years of sales there can be multiple brand names for a given active ingredient. The situation is made even more complicated when companies license their ingredients to others, as is often done. In addition, the product may be pre-mixed with other pesticides under a new brand name. It is therefore difficult to provide a comprehensive list of brand names for products containing azoxystrobin. They include Amistar, Abound, Heritage, Olympus, Ortiva, Priori Xtra, Scotts DiseaseEx, Haedes and Quadris.

6475.0	"(""Adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate"", 'Adenosine cyclophosphate')"	mouse	"Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP, cyclic AMP, or 3',5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate) is a second messenger, or cellular signal occurring within cells, that is important in many biological processes. cAMP is a derivative of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and used for intracellular signal transduction in many different organisms, conveying the cAMP-dependent pathway. == History == Earl Sutherland of Vanderbilt University won a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1971 ""for his discoveries concerning the mechanisms of the action of hormones"", especially epinephrine, via second messengers (such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate, cyclic AMP). == Synthesis == The synthesis of cAMP is stimulated by trophic hormones that bind to receptors on the cell surface. cAMP levels reach maximal levels within minutes and decrease gradually over an hour in cultured cells. Cyclic AMP is synthesized from ATP by adenylate cyclase located on the inner side of the plasma membrane and anchored at various locations in the interior of the cell. Adenylate cyclase is activated by a range of signaling molecules through the activation of adenylate cyclase stimulatory G (Gs)-protein-coupled receptors. Adenylate cyclase is inhibited by agonists of adenylate cyclase inhibitory G (Gi)-protein-coupled receptors. Liver adenylate cyclase responds more strongly to glucagon, and muscle adenylate cyclase responds more strongly to adrenaline. cAMP decomposition into AMP is catalyzed by the enzyme phosphodiesterase. == Functions == cAMP is a second messenger, used for intracellular signal transduction, such as transferring into cells the effects of hormones like glucagon and adrenaline, which cannot pass through the plasma membrane. It is also involved in the activation of protein kinases. In addition, cAMP binds to and regulates the function of ion channels such as the HCN channels and a few other cyclic nucleotide-binding proteins such as Epac1 and RAPGEF2. === Role in eukaryotic cells === cAMP is associated with kinases function in several biochemical processes, including the regulation of glycogen, sugar, and lipid metabolism. In eukaryotes, cyclic AMP works by activating protein kinase A (PKA, or cAMP-dependent protein kinase). PKA is normally inactive as a tetrameric holoenzyme, consisting of two catalytic and two regulatory units (C2R2), with the regulatory units blocking the catalytic centers of the catalytic units. Cyclic AMP binds to specific locations on the regulatory units of the protein kinase, and causes dissociation between the regulatory and catalytic subunits, thus enabling those catalytic units to phosphorylate substrate proteins. The active subunits catalyze the transfer of phosphate from ATP to specific serine or threonine residues of protein substrates. The phosphorylated proteins may act directly on the cell's ion channels, or may become activated or inhibited enzymes. Protein kinase A can also phosphorylate specific proteins that bind to promoter regions of DNA, causing increases in transcription. Not all protein kinases respond to cAMP. Several classes of protein kinases, including protein kinase C, are not cAMP-dependent. Further effects mainly depend on cAMP-dependent protein kinase, which vary based on the type of cell. Still, there are some minor PKA-independent functions of cAMP, e.g., activation of calcium channels, providing a minor pathway by which growth hormone-releasing hormone causes a release of growth hormone. However, the view that the majority of the effects of cAMP are controlled by PKA is an outdated one. In 1998 a family of cAMP-sensitive proteins with guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity was discovered. These are termed Exchange proteins activated by cAMP (Epac) and the family comprises Epac1 and Epac2. The mechanism of activation is similar to that of PKA: the GEF domain is usually masked by the N-terminal region containing the cAMP binding domain. When cAMP binds, the domain dissociates and exposes the now-active GEF domain, allowing Epac to activate small Ras-like GTPase proteins, such as Rap1. ==== Additional role of secreted cAMP in social amoebae ==== In the species Dictyostelium discoideum, cAMP acts outside the cell as a secreted signal. The chemotactic aggregation of cells is organized by periodic waves of cAMP that propagate between cells over distances as large as several centimetres. The waves are the result of a regulated production and secretion of extracellular cAMP and a spontaneous biological oscillator that initiates the waves at centers of territories. === Role in bacteria === In bacteria, the level of cAMP varies depending on the medium used for growth. In particular, cAMP is low when glucose is the carbon source. This occurs through inhibition of the cAMP-producing enzyme, adenylate cyclase, as a side-effect of glucose transport into the cell. The transcription factor cAMP receptor protein (CRP) also called CAP (catabolite gene activator protein) forms a complex with cAMP and thereby is activated to bind to DNA. CRP-cAMP increases expression of a large number of genes, including some encoding enzymes that can supply energy independent of glucose. cAMP, for example, is involved in the positive regulation of the lac operon. In an environment with a low glucose concentration, cAMP accumulates and binds to the allosteric site on CRP (cAMP receptor protein), a transcription activator protein. The protein assumes its active shape and binds to a specific site upstream of the lac promoter, making it easier for RNA polymerase to bind to the adjacent promoter to start transcription of the lac operon, increasing the rate of lac operon transcription. With a high glucose concentration, the cAMP concentration decreases, and the CRP disengages from the lac operon. == Pathology == Since cyclic AMP is a second messenger and plays vital role in cell signalling, it has been implicated in various disorders but not restricted to the roles given below: === Role in human carcinoma === Some research has suggested that a deregulation of cAMP pathways and an aberrant activation of cAMP-controlled genes is linked to the growth of some cancers. === Role in prefrontal cortex disorders === Research suggests that cAMP affects the function of higher-order thinking in the prefrontal cortex through its regulation of ion channels called hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (HCN). HCN channels will open when exposed to cAMP. Once the HCN channel is open, the electrical activity within the neuron is disrupted and the cell becomes less responsive. This interferes with the function of the prefrontal cortex in working memory tasks. Inhibition of cAMP has been observed to improve spatial working memory. cAMP is involved in activation of trigeminocervical system leading to neurogenic inflammation and causing migraine. === Role in infectious disease agents' pathogenesis === Disrupted functioning of cAMP has been noted as one of the mechanisms of several bacterial exotoxins. They can be subgrouped into two distinct categories: Toxins that interfere with enzymes ADP-ribosyl-transferases, and invasive adenylate cyclases. ==== ADP-ribosyl-transferases related toxins ==== Cholera toxin is an AB toxin that has five B subunints and one A subunit. The toxin acts by the following mechanism: First, the B subunit ring of the cholera toxin binds to GM1 gangliosides on the surface of target cells. If a cell lacks GM1 the toxin most likely binds to other types of glycans, such as Lewis Y and Lewis X, attached to proteins instead of lipids. == Uses == Forskolin is commonly used as a tool in biochemistry to raise levels of cAMP in the study and research of cell physiology. == See also == Cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) 8-Bromoadenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (8-Br-cAMP) Acrasin specific to chemotactic use in Dictyostelium discoideum. phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE 4) which degrades cAMP == References =="	Adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate	WIKIPEDIA	('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -9.639096970204264e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.1472419600977446e-06), ('US', 0.0)])

115936.0	('Glycerol monooleate', 'Glycerol mono-oleate', 'Octadec-9-enoic acid 2,3-dihydroxy-propyl ester', 'Monoolein')	mouse	 During the last few decades, both scientific and applied research communities have shown increased attention to self-assembled lyotropic liquid crystalline phases of polar lipids, due to their remarkable structural complexity and usefulness in diverse applications. Amphiphilic properties of polar lipids in relation to water are the driving force for self-assemblies following an extraordinary polymorphism. This polymorphism is an interesting phenomenon in which lipids combine short-range disorder and long-range order. The most widely investigated liquid crystalline phases are the lamellar, the cubic and the hexagonal. Such phases have high solubilization capacity for hydrophilic, lipophilic and amphiphilic guest molecules and the ability to protect molecules against hydrolysis or oxidation. So, they can be used as an interesting drug delivery matrix for drugs, amino acids, peptides, proteins and vitamins in various food, pharmaceutical and biotechnical applications. This review presents recent progress in glycerol monooleate liquid crystalline phases used as drug delivery vehicles. In the present study the initial blood compatibility of glycerol monooleate (GMO)-coated surfaces was evaluated after deposition to surfaces and in bulk. The model surface was silica onto which multiple layers of fibrinogen or human serum albumin (HSA) was immobilized. The protein-coated surfaces were subsequently dip-coated in GMO in ethanol and used for blood plasma and whole blood experiments. The characterization methods included null ellipsometry, scanning electron microscopy, imaging of coagulation, hemolysis test and whole blood coagulation time by free oscillation rheometry. The results showed a GMO film thickness of approximately 350 A (approximately 4 microg/cm(2)) upon dip-coating in ethanolic solution. A major part of the deposited layer detached in aqueous solutions, especially during shear conditions. The coagulation time on GMO was significantly prolonged compared to that on HSA coated silica. Whole blood tests showed that GMO is a very weak hemolytic agent. Deposited GMO detached easily from surfaces upon rinsing or shearing, although a stable layer with undefined phase structure and a thickness of 50-70 A remained on HSA and fibrinogen precoated surfaces. This indicates that GMO has stronger adhesive forces to its substrate compared to the cohesive forces acting within the bulk GMO. The ability of GMO to detach from itself and tentatively form micelles or lipid bilayers when subjected to flowing blood may be of use in extravascular applications. It is concluded that GMO results in weak blood activation, and the material may in spite of this be suitable in selected biomaterial applications, especially as a biosealant and in colloidal dispersions. Herein, a new approach for glycerol monooleate (GMO) was developed. GMO was synthesized via the esterification method using self-made sodium oleate and 3-chloro-1,2-propanediol as reactants, tetrabutylammonium bromide as the catalyst, and toluene as the solvent. The effects of the reaction molar ratio, type and amount of catalyst, and reaction temperature and time on the yield were investigated. Results showed that the optimal process conditions for synthesizing GMO were as follows. The molar ratio of sodium oleate to 3-chloro-1,2-propanediol was 1:2, the reaction temperature was 115°C, the reaction time was 6 h, weight of toluene was 25 g, and the catalyst dosage was 3.5%. Under these conditions, high-purity GMO was synthesized with a yield of 89.02%.

[4,4,4-D3]Isovalerylglycine was synthesized and used as an internal standard. Samples were extracted, methylated, and analyzed by chemical ionization gas chromatography-mass spectrometry operated in the selected ion monitoring mode. This method is very sensitive (lower limit approximately 5 ng/ml), linear over three orders of magnitude above 10 ng/ml up to at least 10 micrograms/ml and reproducible. No isovalerylglycine was detected at all in amniotic fluids from eleven normal pregnant women with an exception of a single case which contained 6 ng/ml. Amniotic fluids from five pregnancies at risk were analyzed. Two of these samples had isovalerylglycine concentrations of 957 and 556 ng/ml. Three others contained 18, 18, and 17 ng/ml of isovalerylglycine. Postpartum diagnostic tests and/or in vitro assay of isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase of [1-14C] isovaleric acid oxidation using amniocytes confirmed that the first two fetuses were affected by isovaleric acidemia, whereas the latter three were unaffected. The method described in this report provides a highly accurate and reliable technique for the prenatal diagnosis of isovaleric acidemia. Recent neonatal screening for isovaleric acidemia by tandem mass spectrometry based on dried blood-spot levels of C5-acylcarnitines, including isovalerylcarnitine and its isomer, pivaloylcarnitine, which is derived from pivalate-generating antibiotics, has caused many false-positive results. We have developed a method to overcome this interference. The amounts of isovalerylglycine were determined by a stable-isotope dilution electrospray tandem mass spectrometric analysis, using multiple-reaction monitoring with product ions of m/z 132, which were generated predominantly from quasi-molecular ions of isovalerylglycine butylester but apparently not from those of pivaloylglycine butylester. Isovalerylglycine concentrations in dried blood spots of control newborns were 0.17+/-0.03 nmol/ml, and those of patients with isovaleric acidemia ranged from 1.3 to 80.0 nmol/ml. Those of the newborns treated with antibiotics, which caused high C5-acylcarnitine levels (1.9+/-1.7 nmol/ml) in dried blood spots, were 0.22+/-0.05 nmol/ml. Our data showed that the present method is useful in eliminating the false-positive results due to antibiotics use in newborn screening for isovaleric acidemia.

98123.0	('Coronaric acid', 'Leukotoxin a (9,10-eode)', 'Bcbcmap01_000147', 'Cytotoxin c (pasteurella haemolytica)', '9(10)-epoxy-12z-octadecenoate')	mouse	Coronaric acid (leukotoxin or leukotoxin A) is a mono-unsaturated, epoxide derivative of the di-unsaturated fatty acid, linoleic acid (i.e. 9(Z),12(Z) octadecadienoic acid). It is a mixture of the two optically active isomers of 12(Z) 9,10-epoxy-octadecenoic acid. This mixture is also termed 9,10-epoxy-12Z-octadecenoic acid or 9(10)-EpOME (for Epoxy-Octadeca-MonoEnoic acid) and when formed by or studied in mammalians, leukotoxin. == Occurrence == Coronaric acid is found in the seed oils derived from plants in the sunflower family, such as Helianthus annuus and Xeranthemum annuum. Coronaric acid is also formed by the cells and tissues of various mammalian (including human) species through the metabolism of linoleic acid by cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenase enzymes. These CYPs (CYP2C9 and probably other CYPs that metabolize polyunsaturated fatty acids to epoxides) metabolize linoleic acid to 9S,10R-epoxy-12(Z)-octadecenoic acid and 9R,10S-epoxy-12(Z)-octadecenoic acid, i.e. the (+) and (-) epoxy optical isomers of coronaric acid. When studied in this context, the optical isomer mixture is often termed leukotoxin. These same CYP epoxygenases concurrently attack linoleic acid at the carbon 12,13 rather than 9,10 double bond of linoleic acid to form a mixture of (+) and (-) epoxy optical isomers viz., 12S,13R-epoxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic and 12R,13S-epoxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic acids. This (+) and (-) optical mixture is often termed vernolic acid when studied in plants and isoleukotoxin when studied in mammals. Coronaric acid is found in urine samples from healthy human subjects and increases 3- to 4-fold when these subjects are treated with a salt-loading diet. Coronaric and vernolic acids also form non-enzymatically when linoleic acid is exposed to oxygen and/or UV radiation as a result of the spontaneous process of autoxidation. This autoxidation complicates studies in that it is often difficult to determine if these epoxy fatty acids identified in linoleic acid-rich plant and mammalian tissues represent actual tissue contents or are artifacts formed during their isolation and detection. == Metabolism == In mammalian tissue, coronaric acid is metabolized to its two corresponding dihydroxy stereoisomers, 9S,10R-dihydroxy-12(Z)-octadecenoic and 9R,10S-dihydroxy-12(Z)-octadecenoic acids, by soluble epoxide hydrolase within minutes of its formation. The metabolism of coronaric acid to these two products, collectively termed leukotoxin diols, appears to be critical to coronaric acid's toxicity, i.e. the diols are the toxic metabolites of the non-toxic or far less toxic coronaric acid. == Activities == === Toxicities === At very high concentrations, the linoleic acid-derived set of optical isomers, coronaric acid (i.e. leukotoxin) possesses toxicity similar to that of other structurally unrelated leukotoxins. It is toxic to leukocytes and other cell types, and when injected into rodents produces multiple organ failure and respiratory distress. These effects appear to be due to its conversion to its dihydroxy counterparts, 9S,10R- and 9R,10S-dihydroxy-12(Z)-octadecenoic acids by soluble epoxide hydrolase. Some studies suggest, but have not yet proven, that isoleukotoxin, acting primarily if not exclusively through its dihydroxy counterparts, is responsible for or contributes to multiple organ failure, the acute respiratory distress syndrome, and certain other cataclysmic diseases in humans (see Epoxygenase § Linoleic acid). Vernolic acid (i.e. isoleukotoxin) shares a similar metabolic fate in being converted by soluble epoxide hydrolase to its dihydroxide counterparts, resulting in the toxic actions of those counterparts. === Other activities === At lower concentrations, isoleukotoxin and its dihydroxy counterparts can protect from the toxic actions cited above that occur at higher concentrations of isoleukotoxin and leukotoxin; they may also share with the epoxides of arachidonic acid, i.e. the epoxyeicosatreienoates (see Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids), anti-hypertension activities. == References ==	Coronaric acid	WIKIPEDIA	('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.00278550386428833), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.00020377879263833165), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.0003357006062287837), (' FOOD', -3.128163257315464e-07)])

114879.0	('Bilirubin', 'Hematoidin', 'Hemetoidin', 'Bilirubin ix-alpha', 'Cholerythrin')	mouse	"Bilirubin (BR) (adopted from German, originally bili—bile—plus ruber—red—from Latin) is a red-orange compound that occurs in the normcomponent of the straw-yellow color in urine. Another breakdown product, stercobilin, causes the brown color of feces. Although bilirubin is usually found in animals rather than plants, at least one plant species, Strelitzia nicolai, is known to contain the pigment. == Structure == Bilirubin consists of an open-chain tetrapyrrole. It is formed by oxidative cleavage of a porphyrin in heme, which affords biliverdin. Biliverdin is reduced to bilirubin. After conjugation with glucuronic acid, bilirubin is water-soluble and can be excreted. Bilirubin is structurally similar to the pigment phycobilin used by certain algae to capture light energy, and to the pigment phytochrome used by plants to sense light. All of these contain an open chain of four pyrrolic rings. Like these other pigments, some of the double-bonds in bilirubin isomerize when exposed to light. This isomerization is relevant to the phototherapy of jaundiced newborns: the E,Z-isomers of bilirubin formed upon light exposure are more soluble than the unilluminated Z,Z-isomer, as the possibility of intramolecular hydrogen bonding is removed. Increased solubility allows the excretion of unconjugated bilirubin in bile. Some textbooks and research articles show the incorrect geometric isomer of bilirubin. The naturally occurring isomer is the Z,Z-isomer. == Function == Bilirubin is created by the activity of biliverdin reductase on biliverdin, a green tetrapyrrolic bile pigment that is also a product of heme catabolism. Bilirubin, when oxidized, reverts to become biliverdin once again. This cycle, in addition to the demonstration of the potent antioxidant activity of bilirubin, has led to the hypothesis that bilirubin's main physiologic role is as a cellular antioxidant. Consistent with this, animal studies suggest that eliminating bilirubin results in endogenous oxidative stress. Bilirubin's antioxidant activity may be particularly important in the brain, where it prevents excitotoxicity and neuronal death by scavenging superoxide during N-methyl-D-aspartic acid neurotransmission. == Metabolism == Bilirubin in plasma is mostly produced by the destruction of erythrocytes. Heme is metabolized into biliverdin (via heme oxygenase) and then into bilirubin (via biliverdin reductase) inside the macrophages. Bilirubin is then released into the plasma and transported to the liver bound by albumin, since it is insoluble in water in this state. In this state, bilirubin is called unconjugated (despite being bound by albumin). In the liver, unconjugated bilirubin is up-taken by the hepatocytes and subsequently conjugated with glucuronic acid (via the enzyme uridine diphosphate–glucuronyl transferase). In this state, bilirubin is soluble in water and it is called conjugated bilirubin. Conjugated bilirubin is excreted into the bile ducts and enters the duodenum. During its transport to the colon, it is converted into urobilinogen by the bacterial enzyme bilirubin reductase. Most of the urobilinogen is further reduced into stercobilinogen and is excreted through feces (air oxidizes stercobilinogen to stercobilin, which gives feces their characteristic brown color). A lesser amount of urobilinogen is re-absorbed into portal circulation and transferred to the liver. For the most part, this urobilinogen is recycled to conjugated bilirubin and this process closes the enterohepatic circle. There is also an amount of urobilinogen which is not recycled, but rather enters the systemic circulation and subsequently the kidneys, where it is excreted. Air oxidizes urobilinogen into urobilin, which gives urine its characteristic color. In parallel, a small amount of conjugated billirubin can also enter the systemic circulation and get excreted through urine. This is exaggerated in various pathological situations. == Toxicity == === Hyperbilirubinemia === Hyperbilirubinemia is a higher-than-normal level of bilirubin in the blood. Hyperbilirubinemia may refer to increased levels of conjugated, unconjugated or both conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin. The causes of hyperbilirubinemia can also be classified into prehepatic, intrahepatic, and posthepatic. Prehepatic causes are associated mostly with an increase of unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin. They include: Hemolysis or increased breakdown of red blood cells (for example hematoma resorption) Intrahepatic causes can be associated with elevated levels of conjugated bilirubin, unconjugated bilirubin or both. They include: Neonatal hyperbilirubinemia, where the newborn's liver is not able to properly process the bilirubin causing jaundice Hepatocellular disease Viral infections (hepatitis A, B, and C) Chronic alcohol use Autoimmune disorders Genetic syndromes: Gilbert's syndrome – a genetic disorder of bilirubin metabolism that can result in mild jaundice, found in about 5% of the population Rotor syndrome: non-itching jaundice, with rise of bilirubin in the patient's serum, mainly of the conjugated type Dubin–Johnson syndrome Crigler–Najjar syndrome Pharmaceutical drugs (especially antipsychotic, some sex hormones, and a wide range of other drugs) Sulfonamides are contraindicated in infants less than 2 months old (exception when used with pyrimethamine in treating toxoplasmosis) as they increase unconjugated bilirubin leading to kernicterus. Drugs such as protease inhibitors like Indinavir can also cause disorders of bilirubin metabolism by competitively inhibiting the UGT1A1 enzyme. Post-hepatic causes are associated with elevated levels of conjugated bilirubin. These include: Unusually large bile duct obstruction, e.g. gallstone in common bile duct (which is the most common post-hepatic cause) Biliary stricture (benign or malignant) Cholangitis Severe liver failure with cirrhosis (e.g. primary biliary cirrhosis) Pancreatitis Cirrhosis may cause normal, moderately high or high levels of bilirubin, depending on exact features of the cirrhosis. To further elucidate the causes of jaundice or increased bilirubin, it is usually simpler to look at other liver function tests (especially the enzymes alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, alkaline phosphatase), blood film examination (hemolysis, etc.) or evidence of infective hepatitis (e.g., hepatitis A, B, C, delta, E, etc.). ==== Jaundice ==== Hemoglobin acts to transport oxygen which the body receives to all body tissue via blood vessels. Over time, when red blood cells need to be replenished, the hemoglobin is broken down in the spleen; it breaks down into two parts: heme group consisting of iron and bile, and protein fraction. While protein and iron are utilized to renew red blood cells, pigments that make up the red color in blood are deposited into the bile to form bilirubin. Jaundice leads to raised bilirubin levels> that in turn negatively remove elastin-rich tissues. Jaundice may be noticeable in the sclera of the eyes at levels of about 2 to 3 mg/dl (34 to 51 μmol/L), and in the skin at higher levels. Jaundice is classified, depending upon whether the bilirubin is free or conjugated to glucuronic acid, into conjugated jaundice or unconjugated jaundice. ==== Kernicterus ==== Unbound bilirubin (Bf) levels can be used to predict the risk of neurodevelopmental handicaps within infants. Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia in a newborn can lead to accumulation of bilirubin in certain brain regions (particularly the basal nuclei) with consequent irreversible damage to these areas manifesting as various neurological deficits, seizures, abnormal reflexes and eye movements. This type of neurological injury is known as kernicterus. The spectrum of clinical effect is called bilirubin encephalopathy. The neurotoxicity of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia manifests because the blood–brain barrier has yet to develop fully, and bilirubin can freely pass into the brain interstitium, whereas more developed individuals with increased bilirubin in the blood are protected. Aside from specific chronic medical conditions that may lead to hyperbilirubinemia, neonates in general are at increased risk since they lack the intestinal bacteria that facilitate the breakdown and excretion of conjugated bilirubin in the feces (this is largely why the feces of a neonate are paler than those of an adult). Instead the conjugated bilirubin is converted back into the unconjugated form by the enzyme β-glucuronidase (in the gut, this enzyme is located in the brush border of the lining intestinal cells) and a large proportion is reabsorbed through the enterohepatic circulation. In addition, recent studies point towards high total bilirubin levels as a cause for gallstones regardless of gender or age. == Health benefits == In the absence of liver disease, high levels of total bilirubin confers various health benefits. Studies have also revealed that levels of serum bilirubin (SBR) are inversely related to risk of certain heart diseases. While the poor solubility and potential toxicity of bilirubin limit its potential medicinal applications, current research is being done on whether bilirubin encapsulated silk fibrin nanoparticles can alleviate symptoms of disorders such as acute pancreatitis. In addition to this, there have been recent discoveries linking bilirubin and its ε-polylysine-bilirubin conjugate (PLL-BR), to more efficient insulin medication. It seems that bilirubin exhibits protective properties during the islet transplantation process when drugs are delivered throughout the bloodstream. == Blood tests == Bilirubin is degraded by light. Blood collection tubes containing blood or (especially) serum to be used in bilirubin assays should be protected from illumination. For adults, blood is typically collected by needle from a vein in the arm. In newborns, blood is often collected from a heel stick, a technique that uses a small, sharp blade to cut the skin on the infant's heel and collect a few drops of blood into a small tube. Non-invasive technology is available in some health care facilities that will measure bilirubin by using a bilirubinometer which shines light onto the skin and calculates the amount of bilirubin by analysing how the light is absorbed or reflected. This device is also known as a transcutaneous bilirubin meter. Bilirubin (in blood) is found in two forms: Note: Conjugated bilirubin is often incorrectly called ""direct bilirubin"" and unconjugated bilirubin is incorrectly called ""indirect bilirubin"". Direct and indirect refer solely to how compounds are measured or detected in solution. Direct bilirubin is any form of bilirubin which is water-soluble and is available in solution to react with assay reagents; direct bilirubin is often made up largely of conjugated bilirubin, but some unconjugated bilirubin (up to 25%) can still be part of the ""direct"" bilirubin fraction. Likewise, not all conjugated bilirubin is readily available in solution for reaction or detection (for example, if it is hydrogen bonding with itself) and therefore would not be included in the direct bilirubin fraction. Total bilirubin (TBIL) measures both BU and BC. Total bilirubin assays work by using surfactants and accelerators (like caffeine) to bring all of the different bilirubin forms into solution where they can react with assay reagents. Total and direct bilirubin levels can be measured from the blood, but indirect bilirubin is calculated from the total and direct bilirubin. Indirect bilirubin is fat-soluble and direct bilirubin is water-soluble. === Total bilirubin === Total bilirubin = direct bilirubin + indirect bilirubin Elevation of both alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin is more indicative of serious liver injury than is elevation in ALT alone, as postulated in Hy's law that elucidates the relation between the lab test results and drug-induced liver injury === Indirect (unconjugated) === The measurement of unconjugated bilirubin (UCB) is underestimated by measurement of indirect bilirubin, as unconjugated bilirubin (without/yet glucuronidation) reacts with diazosulfanilic acid to create azobilirubin which is measured as direct bilirubin. === Direct === Direct bilirubin = Conjugated bilirubin + delta bilirubin ==== Conjugated ==== In the liver, bilirubin is conjugated with glucuronic acid by the enzyme glucuronyltransferase, first to bilirubin glucuronide and then to bilirubin diglucuronide, making it soluble in water: the conjugated version is the main form of bilirubin present in the ""direct"" bilirubin fraction. Much of it goes into the bile and thus out into the small intestine. Though most bile acid is reabsorbed in the terminal ileum to participate in enterohepatic circulation, conjugated bilirubin is not absorbed and instead passes into the colon. There, colonic bacteria deconjugate and metabolize the bilirubin into colorless urobilinogen, which can be oxidized to form urobilin and stercobilin. Urobilin is excreted by the kidneys to give urine its yellow color and stercobilin is excreted in the feces giving stool its characteristic brown color. A trace (~1%) of the urobilinogen is reabsorbed into the enterohepatic circulation to be re-excreted in the bile. Conjugated bilirubin's half-life is shorter than delta bilirubin. ==== Delta bilirubin ==== Although the terms direct and indirect bilirubin are sometimes used interchangeably with conjugated and unconjugated bilirubin, the direct fraction actually includes both conjugated bilirubin and delta bilirubin. Delta bilirubin is albumin-bound conjugated bilirubin. In the other words, delta bilirubin is the kind of bilirubin covalently bound to albumin, which appears in the serum when hepatic excretion of conjugated bilirubin is impaired in patients with hepatobiliary disease. Furthermore, direct bilirubin tends to overestimate conjugated bilirubin levels due to unconjugated bilirubin that has reacted with diazosulfanilic acid, leading to increased azobilirubin levels (and increased direct bilirubin). δ bilirubin = total bilirubin – (unconjugated bilirubin + conjugated bilirubin) ===== Half-life ===== The half-life of delta bilirubin is equivalent to that of albumin since the former is bound to the latter, yields 2–3 weeks. A free-of-bound bilirubin has a half-life of 2 to 4 hours. === Measurement methods === Originally, the Van den Bergh reaction was used for a qualitative estimate of bilirubin. This test is performed routinely in most medical laboratories and can be measured by a variety of methods. Total bilirubin is now often measured by the 2,5-dichlorophenyldiazonium (DPD) method, and direct bilirubin is often measured by the method of Jendrassik and Grof. == Blood levels == The bilirubin level found in the body reflects the balance between production and excretion. Blood test results are advised to always be interpreted using the reference range provided by the laboratory that performed the test. The SI units are μmol/L. Typical ranges for adults are: 0–0.3 mg/dl – Direct (conjugated) bilirubin level 0.1–1.2 mg/dl – Total serum bilirubin level == Urine tests == Urine bilirubin may also be clinically significant. Bilirubin is not normally detectable in the urine of healthy people. If the blood level of conjugated bilirubin becomes elevated, e.g. due to liver disease, excess conjugated bilirubin is excreted in the urine, indicating a pathological process. Unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble and so is not excreted in the urine. Testing urine for both bilirubin and urobilinogen can help differentiate obstructive liver disease from other causes of jaundice. As with billirubin, under normal circumstances, only a very small amount of urobilinogen is excreted in the urine. If the liver's function is impaired or when biliary drainage is blocked, some of the conjugated bilirubin leaks out of the hepatocytes and appears in the urine, turning it dark amber. However, in disorders involving hemolytic anemia, an increased number of red blood cells are broken down, causing an increase in the amount of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood. Because the unconjugated bilirubin is not water-soluble, one will not see an increase in bilirubin in the urine. Because there is no problem with the liver or bile systems, this excess unconjugated bilirubin will go through all of the normal processing mechanisms that occur (e.g., conjugation, excretion in bile, metabolism to urobilinogen, reabsorption) and will show up as an increase of urobilinogen in the urine. This difference between increased urine bilirubin and increased urine urobilinogen helps to distinguish between various disorders in those systems. == History == In ancient history, Hippocrates discussed bile pigments in two of the four humours in the context of a relationship between yellow and black biles. Hippocrates visited Democritus in Abdera who was regarded as the expert in melancholy ""black bile"". Relevant documentation emerged in 1827 when M. Louis Jacques Thénard examined the biliary tract of an elephant that had died at a Paris zoo. He observed dilated bile ducts were full of yellow magma, which he isolated and found to be insoluble in water. Treating the yellow pigment with hydrochloric acid produced a strong green color. Thenard suspected the green pigment was caused by impurities derived from mucus of bile. Leopold Gmelin experimented with nitric acid in 1826 to establish the redox behavior in change from bilirubin to biliverdin, although the nomenclature did not exist at the time. The term biliverdin was coined by Jöns Jacob Berzelius in 1840, although he preferred ""bilifulvin"" (yellow/red) over ""bilirubin"" (red). The term ""bilirubin"" was thought to have become mainstream based on the works of Staedeler in 1864 who crystallized bilirubin from cattle gallstones. Rudolf Virchow in 1847 recognized hematoidin to be identical to bilirubin. It is not always distinguished from hematoidin, which one modern dictionary defines as synonymous with it but another defines as ""apparently chemically identical with bilirubin but with a different site of origin, formed locally in the tissues from hemoglobin, particularly under conditions of reduced oxygen tension."" The synonymous identity of bilirubin and hematoidin was confirmed in 1923 by Fischer and Steinmetz using analytical crystallography. In the 1930s, significant advances in bilirubin isolation and synthesis were described by Hans Fischer, Plieninger, and others, and pioneering work pertaining to endogenous formation of bilirubin from heme was likewise conducted in the same decade. The suffix IXα is partially based on a system developed Fischer, which means the bilin's parent compound was protoporphyrin IX cleaved at the alpha-methine bridge (see protoporphyrin IX nomenclature). Origins pertaining to the physiological activity of bilirubin were described by Ernst Stadelmann in 1891, who may have observed the biotransformation of infused hemoglobin into bilirubin possibly inspired by Ivan Tarkhanov's 1874 works. Georg Barkan suggested the source of endogenous bilirubin to be from hemoglobin in 1932. Plieninger and Fischer demonstrated an enzymatic oxidative loss of the alpha-methine bridge of heme resulting in a bis-lactam structure in 1942. It is widely accepted that Irving London was the first to demonstrate endogenous formation of bilirubin from hemoglobin in 1950, and Sjostrand demonstrated hemoglobin catabolism produces carbon monoxide between 1949 and 1952. 14C labeled protoporphyrin biotransformation to bilirubin evidence emerged in 1966 by Cecil Watson. Rudi Schmid and Tenhunen discovered heme oxygenase, the enzyme responsible, in 1968. Earlier in 1963, Nakajima described a soluble ""heme alpha-methnyl oxygeanse"" which what later determined to be a non-enzymatic pathway, such as formation of a 1,2-Dioxetane intermediate at the methine bridge resulting in carbon monoxide release and biliverdin formation. == Notable people == Claudio Tiribelli, Italian hepatologist, studies on bilirubin == See also == Babesiosis Biliary atresia Bilirubin diglucuronide Biliverdin Crigler–Najjar syndrome Gilbert's syndrome, a genetic disorder of bilirubin metabolism that can result in mild jaundice, found in about 5% of the population.

After nearly 2 decades of efforts in addressing the problems of the poor drug profile of naked unmodified siRNAs, this new modality has finally come to fruition, with 5 agents (patisiran, givosiran, lumasiran, inclisiran, and vutrisiran) being approved since 2018, and with many others in the different phases of clinical development. Unlike small-molecule drugs and protein therapeutics, siRNAs have different sizes, distinct mechanisms of action, differing physicochemical and pharmacological properties, and, accordingly, a unique pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship. To support the continuous development of siRNAs, it is important to have a thorough and deep understanding of the PK/PD and clinical pharmacology related features of siRNAs. As most of the current siRNA products are conjugated by N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), this review focuses on the PK/PD relationships and clinical pharmacology of GalNAc-conjugated siRNAs, including their absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME) properties, PK/PD models, drug-drug interactions, clinical pharmacology in special populations, and safety evaluation. In addition, necessary background information related to the development of siRNAs as a therapeutic modality, including the mechanisms of action, the advantages of siRNAs, the problems of naked siRNAs, as well as the strategies used to enhance the clinical utility of siRNAs, have also been covered. The goal of this review is to serve as a ""primer"" on siRNA PK/PD, and I hope the readers, especially those who have a limited background on siRNA therapeutics, will have a fundamental understanding of siRNA PK/PD and clinical pharmacology after reading this review. Short-interfering RNA (siRNA)-induced RNAi responses have great potential to treat a wide variety of human diseases from cancer to pandemic viral outbreaks to Parkinson's Disease. However, before siRNAs can become drugs, they must overcome a billion years of evolutionary defenses designed to keep invading RNAs on the outside cells from getting to the inside of cells. Not surprisingly, significant effort has been placed in developing a wide array of delivery technologies. Foremost of these has been the development of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) siRNA conjugates for delivery to liver. Tris-GalNAc binds to the Asialoglycoprotein receptor that is highly expressed on hepatocytes resulting in rapid endocytosis. While the exact mechanism of escape across the endosomal lipid bilayer membrane remains unknown, sufficient amounts of siRNAs enter the cytoplasm to induce robust, target selective RNAi responses in vivo. Multiple GalNAc-siRNA conjugate clinical trials, including two phase III trials, are currently underway by three biotech companies to treat a wide variety of diseases. GalNAc-siRNA conjugates are a simple solution to the siRNA delivery problem for liver hepatocytes and have shown the RNAi (and antisense oligonucleotide) field the path forward for targeting other tissue types. One hallmark of trivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-conjugated siRNAs is the remarkable durability of silencing that can persist for months in preclinical species and humans. Here, we investigated the underlying biology supporting this extended duration of pharmacological activity. We found that siRNA accumulation and stability in acidic intracellular compartments is critical for long-term activity. We show that functional siRNA can be liberated from these compartments and loaded into newly generated Argonaute 2 protein complexes weeks after dosing, enabling continuous RNAi activity over time. Identical siRNAs delivered in lipid nanoparticles or as GalNAc conjugates were dose-adjusted to achieve similar knockdown, but only GalNAc-siRNAs supported an extended duration of activity, illustrating the importance of receptor-mediated siRNA trafficking in the process. Taken together, we provide several lines of evidence that acidic intracellular compartments serve as a long-term depot for GalNAc-siRNA conjugates and are the major contributor to the extended duration of activity observed in vivo."

Spermidine synthase (SPDS) catalyzes its formation from putrescine. It is a precursor to other polyamines, such as spermine and its structural isomer thermospermine. Spermidine synchronizes an array of biological processes, (such as Ca2+, Na+, K+ -ATPase) thus maintaining membrane potential and controlling intracellular pH and volume. Spermidine regulates biological processes, such as Ca2+ influx by glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA receptor), which has been associated with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and cGMP/PKG pathway activation and a decrease of Na+,K+-ATPase activity in cerebral cortex synaptosomes. Spermidine is a longevity agent in mammals due to various mechanisms of action, which are just beginning to be understood. Autophagy is the main mechanism at the molecular level, but evidence has been found for other mechanisms, including inflammation reduction, lipid metabolism, and regulation of cell growth, proliferation, and death. Spermidine has been theorized to promote autophagy via the MAPK pathway by inhibiting phosphorylation of raf, or possibly by inhibiting cytosolic autophagy-related protein acetylation by EP300 and thereby increasing acetylation of tubulin. Spermidine is known to regulate plant growth, assisting the in vitro process of transcribing RNA, and inhibition of NOS. Also, spermidine is a precursor to other polyamines, such as spermine and thermospermine, some of which contribute to tolerance against drought and salinity in plants. Spermidine has been tested and discovered to encourage hair shaft elongation and lengthen hair growth. Spermidine has also been found to “upregulate expression of the epithelial stem cell-associated keratins K15 and K19, and dose-dependently modulated K15 promoter activity in situ and the colony forming efficiency, proliferation and K15 expression of isolated human K15-GFP+ cells in vitro.” == Biochemical actions == Spermidine's known actions include: Inhibits neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) Binds and precipitates DNA Polyamine plant growth regulator == Sources == Good dietary sources of spermidine are aged cheese, mushrooms, soy products, legumes, corn, and whole grains. Spermidine is plentiful in a Mediterranean diet. For comparison: The spermidine content in human seminal plasma varies between approx. 15 and 50 mg/L (mean 31 mg/L). Note: spermidine content varies by source and age. See ref for details. In grains, the endosperm contains most of the spermidine. One of the best known grain dietary sources is wheat germ, containing as much as 243 mg/kg. == Uses == Spermidine can be used in electroporation while transferring the DNA into the cell under the electrical impulse. May be used for purification of DNA-binding proteins. Spermidine is also used, along with calcium chloride, for precipitating DNA onto microprojectiles for bombardment with a gene gun. Spermidine has also been reported to protect the heart from aging and prolong the lifespan of mice, while in humans it was correlated with lower blood pressure. It also was found to reduce the amount of aging in yeast, flies, worms, and human immune cells by inducing autophagy. Spermidine may play a role in male and female fertility. Fertile men have higher spermidine levels than men who are infertile, and spermidine supplementation has been shown to help maintain a healthy hormone balance and reduce oxidative stress. Spermidine is commonly used for in vitro molecular biology reactions, particularly, in vitro transcription by phage RNA polymerases, in vitro transcription by human RNA polymerase II, and in vitro translation. Spermidine increases specificity and reproducibility of Taq-mediated PCR by neutralizing and stabilizing the negative charge on DNA phosphate backbone. == See also == Norspermidine – chemical compoundPages displaying wikidata descriptions as a fallback Putrescine – Foul-smelling organic chemical compound Spermine – Polyamine involved in cellular metabolism == References == == External links == Safety Data Sheet	Spermidine	WIKIPEDIA	('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('END', -0.0026137058157473803), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.0002619318547658622), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -3.91732100979425e-05), (',', -0.014177612029016018), (' PERSONAL', -0.11605098843574524), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.03812927380204201), (' INDUSTR', -0.0040799472481012344), ('IAL', 0.0)])

The laboratory diagnosis is limited to the analysis of three biomarkers in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): amyloid-β42 (Aβ42), total tau, and phospho-tau-181 (P-tau-181). However, there is a need to find more biomarkers in CSF that can improve the sensitivity and specificity. The aim of the present study was to analyze endogenous small metabolites (metabolome) in the CSF, which may provide potentially new insights into biochemical processes involved in AD. One hundred CSF samples were dichotomized by normal (n = 50) and pathological decreased Aβ42 and increased tau and P-tau-181 levels (n = 50; correlating to an AD-like pathology). These CSF samples were analyzed using the AbsoluteIDQ® p180 Kit (BIOCRATES Life Sciences), which included 40 acylcarnitines, 21 amino acids, 19 biogenic amines, 15 sphingolipids, and 90 glycerophospholipids. Our data show that two sphingomyelins (SM (d18:1/18:0) and SM (d18:1/18:1)), 5 glycerophospholipids (PC aa C32:0, PC aa C34:1, PC aa C36:1, PC aa C38:4 and PC aa C38:6), and 1 acylcarnitine (C3-DC-M/C5-OH) were significantly altered in the CSF with pathological ""AD-like pathology"".

92396.0	('Linoleoyl ethanolamide', 'Linoleamide mea', 'Linoleylethanolamide', 'Linoleoylethanolamide', 'Linoleic ethanolamide')	mouse	 Linoleoyl ethanolamide has been showed to serve as a new and additional class of endogenous signaling molecule and exhibited a variety of biological activities in cells and tissues. Herein, we reported an effective method for the synthesis of linoleoyl ethanolamide. Enzymatic and chemical syntheses of linoleoyl ethanolamide were first compared and then reaction conditions were optimized. When the reaction was conducted at 30°C for 1 h by reacting 0.5 mmol methyl linoleate with 5 mmol ethanolamine in the presence of 15 μL, 5.4 mol/L sodium methoxide in methanol as catalyst, 97.2% linoleoyl ethanolamide was produced in the crude reaction mixture without further purification after the removal of excess ethanolamine. Additionally, the reaction can be conducted on a large scale, which resulted in the formation of 95.9% linoleoyl ethanolamide. Compared to previous studies, the amidation reaction between methyl linoleate and ethanolamine with sodium methoxide as catalyst for the synthesis of linoleoyl ethanolamide is more effective and faster. In addition, the reaction is scalable and reaction conditions are mild. This is the first time to use methyl linoleate to synthesize linoleoyl ethanolamide. Commercial linoleoyl ethanolamide is very expensive. However, the scalability and ease for such synthesis make it possible to study the biological and nutritional functions of the cannabinoid-like linoleoyl ethanolamide in animal or human subjects. In our previous study, it was found that linoleoyl ethanolamide (LE) is present in sake lees, which are produced as a byproduct during the making of Japanese sake. LE is a fatty acid ethanolamide, which have been demonstrated to exert a variety of biological functions, and in this study, the anti-inflammatory effects of LE were examined using in vitro cell culture and in vivo animal experiments. In mouse RAW264.7 macrophages, LE suppressed the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6. In addition, LE inhibited LPS-induced increases in the levels of cyclooxygenase enzyme-2 and prostaglandin E(2), which are indicators of inflammation. The inhibitory effect of LE on the release of TNF-α was stronger than that of dipotassium glycyrrhizinate, which is widely used in external human skin care treatments. LE also suppressed the LPS-induced activation of Toll-like receptor 4 signaling and nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65. In a contact dermatitis animal model, applying LE to affected ear skin ameliorated 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene-induced contact dermatitis and pro-inflammatory cytokine expression at inflamed sites. These results indicate that LE exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting NF-κB signaling, and LE is proposed to be a useful therapeutic agent against contact dermatitis.

112639.0	('Camptothecin', 'Camptothecine', '(s)-camptothecin', 'Campathecin', 'Camptothecine (s,+)')	mouse	"Camptothecin (CPT) is a topoisomerase inhibitor. It was discovered in 1966 by M. E. Wall and M. C. Wani in systematic screening of natural products for anticancer drugs. It was isolated from the bark of Camptotheca acuminata (喜树 ""Happy tree""), a tree native to China used in traditional Chinese medicine. It has been used clinically in China for the treatment of gastrointestinal tumors. CPT showed anticancer activity in preliminary clinical trials, especially against breast, ovarian, colon, lung, and stomach cancers. However, it has low solubility and adverse effects have been reported when used therapeutically, so synthetic and medicinal chemists have developed numerous syntheses of camptothecin and various derivatives to increase the benefits of the chemical, with good results. Four CPT analogues have been approved and are used in cancer chemotherapy today: topotecan, irinotecan, belotecan, and trastuzumab deruxtecan. Camptothecin has also been found in other plants including Chonemorpha fragrans. == Structures == CPT has a planar pentacyclic ring structure, that includes a pyrrolo[3,4-β]-quinoline moiety (rings A, B and C), conjugated pyridone moiety (ring D) and one chiral center at position 20 within the alpha-hydroxy lactone ring with (S) configuration (the E-ring). Its planar structure is thought to be one of the most important factors in topoisomerase inhibition. == Binding == CPT binds to the topoisomerase I and DNA complex (the covalent complex) resulting in a ternary complex, and thereby stabilizing it. This prevents DNA re-ligation and therefore causes DNA damage which results in apoptosis. CPT binds both to the enzyme and DNA with hydrogen bonds. The most important part of the structure is the E-ring which interacts from three different positions with the enzyme. The hydroxyl group in position 20 forms hydrogen bond to the side chain on aspartic acid number 533 (Asp533) in the enzyme. It is critical that the configuration of the chiral carbon is (S) because (R) is inactive. The lactone is bonded with two hydrogen bonds to the amino groups on arginine 364 (Arg364). The D-ring interacts with the +1 cytosine on non-cleaved strand and stabilizes the topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complex by forming hydrogen bond. This hydrogen bond is between carbonyl group in position 17 on the D-ring and amino group on the pyrimidine ring of +1 cytosine. CPT is selectively cytotoxic to the cells replicating DNA during S phase and its toxicity is primarily a result of conversion of single-strand breaks into double-strand breaks when the replication fork collides with the cleavage complexes formed by DNA and CPT. == Chemistry == The lactone ring in CPT is highly susceptible to hydrolysis. The open ring form is inactive and it must therefore be closed to inhibit topoisomerase I. The closed form is favored in acidic condition, as it is in many cancer cells microenvironment. CPT is transported into the cell by passive diffusion. Cellular uptake is favored by lipophilicity, which enhances intracellular accumulation. Lipophilicity makes compounds more stable because of improved lactone partitioning into red blood cells and consequently less hydrolysis of the lactone. CPT has affinity for human serum albumin (HSA), especially the carboxylate form of CPT. Because of that, the equilibrium between the lactone ring and the carboxylate form is driven toward the carboxylate. Reduced drug-HSA interactions could result in improved activity. == Structure-activity relationship == Studies have shown that substitution at position 7, 9, 10 and 11 can have positive effect on CPT activity and physical properties, e.g. potency and metabolic stability. Enlargement of the lactone ring by one CH2 unit also enhances its abilities, as in homocamptothecin. Substitution at position 12 and 14 leads to inactive derivative. === A- and B-ring modification === ==== Alkyl substitution ==== Alkyl substitution at position 7 has shown increased cytotoxicity, such as ethyl (C2H5) or chloromethyl (CH2Cl). These groups are able to react with the DNA in the presence of topoisomerase I which leads to more tumor activity. It has also been shown that increasing the length of the carbon chain (in position 7) leads to increased lipophilicity and consequently greater potency and stability in human plasma. Other 7-modified CPT analogues are silatecans and karenitecins. They are potent inhibitors on topoisomerase I and both have alkylsilyl groups in position 7 which make them lipophilic and more stable. Silatecans or 7-silylcampthothecins have shown reduced drug-HSA interactions which contributes to its blood stability and they can also cross the blood brain barrier. DB-67 is a 10-hydroxy derivative and is among the most active silatecans. BNP1350 which belongs to the series of karenitecins exhibits cytotoxic activity and ability to overcome drug resistance. Still another route to make CPT's lipophilic is to introduce lipophilic substituents, such as iminomethyl or oxyiminomethyl moieties. One of the most potent compounds is the oxyiminomethyl derivative ST1481 that has the advantage to overcome drug resistance caused by transport systems. Basic nitrogen in a carbon chain at position 7 makes the compound more hydrophilic and hence more water-soluble. For example, is a derivate called CKD-602, which is a potent topoisomerase I inhibitor and successfully overcomes the poor water solubility and toxicity seen with CPT. Considerably greater activity can be achieved by putting electron-withdrawing groups like amino, nitro, bromo or chloro at position 9 and 10 and hydroxyl group at position 10 or 11. But these compounds are relatively insoluble in aqueous solutions, which causes difficulty in administrations. Methoxy group at both position 10 and 11 simultaneously leads to inactivity. ==== Hexacyclic CPT analogues ==== Hexacyclic CPT analogues have shown great potency. For example, methylenedioxy or ethylenedioxy group connected between 10 and 11 form a 5 or 6 membered ring which leads to more water-soluble derivates and increased potency. Researches have shown that ethylenedioxy analogues are less potent than methylenedioxy. The reason is the unfavorable steric interactions of ethylenedioxy analogues with the enzyme. Adding amino or chloro group at 9th position or chloromethyl group at 7th position to these 10, 11-methylenedioxy or ethylenedioxy analogues results in compounds with even greater cytotoxicity but weaker solubility in water. To yield 10, 11-methylenedioxy or ethylenedioxy analogues with good water solubility a good way is to introduce a water solubilising substituent at position 7. Lurtotecan meets those requirements; it's a 10, 11-ethylenedioxy analogue with a 4-methylpiperazino-methylene at position 7 and has shown a great potency in clinical researches. A ring can also be formed between position 7 and 9, like position 10 and 11. That gives new opportunities to make water-soluble derivatives [5]. These hexacyclic CPT become more active when electron-withdrawing groups are put in position 11 and methyl or amino groups at 10. Exatecan is an example of hexacyclic CPT that has a 6 membered ring over position 7 and 9, and is 10-methyl, 11-fluoro substituted [4]. It is water-soluble and more potent than topotecan. === C- and D-ring modification === The C- and D-rings have an essential role in the antitumor activity. Replacement in any position results in much less potent compound than parent compound in other cytotoxicity assay. === E-ring modifications === The E-ring doesn't allow many structural changes without losing CPT activity because it is necessary for binding to the active site of TOP I. One possible replacement is changing the hydroxyl group to Cl, F or Br because their polarizability is sufficient to stabilize the enzyme-complex. Another possible modification is to insert a methylene between hydroxyl and lactone on the E-ring yielding a seven membered β-hydroxylactone group, so-called homocamptothecin (hCPT). The hCPT's hydroxyl has less inductive effect on the carboxyl group which makes the lactone very reactive. This enhances the interaction of the free hydroxyl group optimally with topoisomerase I and the covalent complex that forms in its presence are more stable. The E-ring of hCPT opens more slowly and the opening is irreversible. hCPTs exhibit enhanced human plasma stability because of decreased protein binding and more affinity for red blood cells than CPT. == CPT analogues == Since the discovery of CPT many analogues have been synthesized. Below is a schematic view of the CPT analogues that have been mentioned in the text above. CPT is linked to a cyclodextrin-based polymer to form the investigational anti-cancer drug CRLX101. == Biosynthesis == Like all other monoterpenoid indole-alkaloids, biosynthesis of camptothecin requires production of the strictosidine. Strictosidine is synthesized through condensation reaction between tryptamine from shikimate pathway and secologanin from either mevalonate (MVA) pathway or non-mevalonate pathway (MEP). Strictosidine then undergoes intermolecular cyclization to produce strictosamide, which is converted to camptothecin through a series of oxidation reactions by enzymes that still needs to be resolved. The shikimate pathway leading to biosynthesis of tryptamine is mostly understood. First, chorismate is converted to anthranilate by the alpha-subunit of anthranilate synthase (ASA). Anthranilate reacts with 5-phosphoribose pyrophosphate to produce 5-phosphoribosylanthranilate. Then this intermediate is converted to indole glycerol phosphate, which interacts with the alpha-subunit of tryptophan (TSA) synthase to yield indole. The beta-subunit of tryptophan synthase (TSB) catalyzes condensation of indole with serine, leading to tryptophan. In the next step, tryptamine is produced as the result of decarboxylation by tryptophan decarboxylase (TDC). Secologanin synthesis begins with condensation reaction between pyruvate and D-Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate catalyzed by 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase (DXS) to produce 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DXP). The conversion of DXP to isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP), which is the common terpenoid biosynthesis precursor involves 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase (DXR) and 1-hydroxy-2-methyl-2(E)-butenyl-4-diphosphate reductase (HDR). The formation of IPP can be achieved by both MVA and MEP pathways. Condensation of IPP and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) yields geranyl diphosphate (GPP). The geraniol synthase (GS) then converts GPP to geraniol. The conversion of geraniol to secologanin occurs through various enzymatic reactions. Based on studies with radioactive labelling and pathway specific inhibitors, MEP pathway is the primary source for secologanin. Tryptamine from shikimate pathway and secologanin from MVA or MEP pathway are converted to strictosidine through a condensation reaction catalyzed by strictosidine synthase. Although it is not fully resolved, it has been postulated that camptothecin is produced from strictosidine via strictosamide, 3 (S)-pumiloside and 3 (S)-deoxypumiloside. == References =="	Camptothecin	WIKIPEDIA	('MEDICAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.011090735904872417), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.00523612555116415), (' FOOD', -0.0006791924242861569)])

Compound danshen dripping pills (CDDP) has obvious advantages in MI treatment and widely used in the clinic. However, the current studies were mostly focused on the endpoint of CDDP intervention, lacking the dynamic attention to the disease process. It is of great value to establish a dynamic research strategy focused on the changes in pharmacodynamic substances for guiding clinical medication more precisely. It is aimed to explore the dynamic regulating pattern of CDDP on MI based on metabolic trajectory analysis, and then clarify the variation characteristic biomarkers and pharmacodynamic substances in the intervention process. The MI model was successfully prepared by coronary artery left anterior descending branch ligation, and then CDDP intervention was given for 28 days. Endogenous metabolites and the components of CDDP in serum were measured by LC/MS technique simultaneously to identify dynamic the metabolic trajectory and screen the characteristic pharmacodynamic substances at different points. Finally, network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques were used to simulate the core pharmacodynamic substances and core target binding, then validated at the genetic and protein level by Q-PCR and western blotting technology. CDDP performed typical dynamic regulation features on metabolite distribution, biological processes, and pharmacodynamic substances. During 1-7 days, it mainly regulated lipid metabolism and inflammation, the Phosphatidylcholine (PC(18:1(9Z/18:1(9Z)) and Sphingomyelin (SM(d18:1/23:1(9Z)), SM(d18:1/24:1(15Z)), SM(d18:0/16:1(9Z))) were the main characteristic biomarkers. Lipid metabolism was the mainly regulation pathway during 14-21 days, and the characteristic biomarkers were the Lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LysoPE(0:0/20:0), PE-NMe2(22:1(13Z)/15:0)) and Sphingomyelin (SM(d18:1/23:1(9Z))). At 28 days, in addition to inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism also played the most important role. Correspondingly, Lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC(20:0/0:0)), Lysophosphatidylserine (LPS(18:0/0:0)) and Fatty acids (Linoelaidic acid) were the characteristic biomarkers. Based on the results of metabolite distribution and biological process, the characteristic pharmacodynamic substances during the intervention were further identified. The results showed that various kinds of Saponins and Tanshinones as the important active ingredients performed a long-range regulating effect on MI. And the other components, such as Tanshinol and Salvianolic acid B affected Phosphatidylcholine and Sphingomyelin through Relaxin Signaling pathway during the early intervention. Protocatechualdehyde and Rosmarinic acid affected Lysophosphatidylethanolamine and Sphingomyelin through EGFR Tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance during the late intervention. Tanshinone IIB and Isocryptotanshinone via PPAR signaling pathway affected Lysophosphatidylcholine, Lysophosphatidylserine, and Fatty acids. The dynamic regulating pattern was taken as the entry point and constructs the dynamic network based on metabolic trajectory analysis, establishes the dynamic correlation between the drug-derived components and the endogenous metabolites, and elucidates the characteristic biomarkers affecting the changes of the pharmacodynamic indexes, systematically and deeply elucidate the pharmacodynamic substance and mechanism of CDDP on MI. It also enriched the understanding of CDDP and provided a methodological reference for the dynamic analysis of complex systems of TCM. Cystinosis is a rare, devastating hereditary disease secondary to recessive  In traditional Chinese medicine, Gynostemma pentaphyllum (G. pentaphyllum) is widely used to treat conditions associated with hyperlipidemia, and its therapeutic potential has been demonstrated in numerous studies. However, the mechanism of lipid metabolism in hyperlipidemic by G. pentaphyllum, especially heat-processed G. pentaphyllum is not yet clear. The aim of this study was to investigate the therapeutic mechanism of gypenosides from heat-processed G. pentaphyllum (HGyp) in hyperlipidemic mice by means of a lipidomics. The content of the major components of HGyp was determined by ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization ion trap mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-MS). An animal model of hyperlipidaemia was constructed using C57BL/6J mice fed with high-fat diet. HGyp was also administered at doses of 50, 100 and 200 mg/kg, all for 12 weeks. Serum parameters were measured, histological sections were prepared and liver lipidome analysis using UPLC-MS coupled with multivariate statistical analysis. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and western blotting were used to analyze the genes and proteins associated with lipid lowering in HGyp. HGyp reduced body weight, serum total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and hepatic lipid accumulation in hyperlipidemic obese mice. To explore specific changes in lipid metabolism in relation to HGyp administration, lipid analysis of the liver was performed. Orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) score plots showed that HGyp altered lipid metabolism in HFD mice. In particular, fatty acids (FA), triglycerides (DG), TG and ceramides (CER) were significantly altered. Eleven lipids were identified as potential lipid biomarkers, namely TG (18:2/20:5/18:2), TG (18:2/18:3/20:4), DG (18:3/20:0/0:0), Cer (d18:1/19:0), Cer (d16:1/23:0), Ceramide (d18:1/9Z-18:1), PS (19:0/18:3), PS (20:2/0:0), LysoPC (22:5), LysoPE (0:0/18:0), PE (24:0/16:1). Western blot and qRT-PCR analysis showed that these metabolic improvements played a role by down-regulating genes and proteins related to fat production (SREBP1, ACC1, SCD1), up-regulating genes and proteins related to lipid oxidation (CPTA1, PPARα) and lipid transport decomposition in the bile acid pathway (LXRα, PPARγ, FXR, BSEP).

Accordingly, gut bacteria-derived metabolites can be employed as a resource to develop anti-obesity and metabolism-modulating drugs. This study aimed to examine the anti-adipogenic effect of 3-phenylpropionylglycine (PPG), which is a glycine conjugate of bacteria-derived 3-phenylpropionic acid (PPA). The effect of PPG on preadipocyte-to-adipocyte differentiation was evaluated in 3T3-L1 differentiation models and the degree of the differentiation was estimated by Oil red O staining. The molecular mechanisms of the PPG effect were investigated with transcriptome analyses using RNA-sequencing and quantitative real-time PCR. PPG suppressed lipid droplet accumulation during the adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells, which is attributed to down-regulation of lipogenic genes such as acetyl CoA carboxylase 1 (Acc1) and fatty acid synthase (Fasn). However, other chemicals with chemical structures similar to PPG, including cinnamoylglycine and hippuric acid, had little effect on the lipid accumulation of 3T3-L1 cells. In transcriptomic analysis, PPG suppressed the expression of adipogenesis and metabolism-related gene sets, which is highly associated with downregulation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway. Protein-protein association network analysis suggested adiponectin as a hub gene in the network of genes that were differentially expressed genes in response to PPG treatment. PPG inhibits preadipocyte-to-adipocyte differentiation by suppressing the adiponectin-PPAR pathway. These data provide a potential candidate from bacteria-derived metabolites with anti-adipogenic effects. Screening for medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency by urinary 3-phenylpropionylglycine may not be reliable in early infancy because young infants are not colonized with adult-type colonic flora. In this study we delineated the microbes that produce 3-phenylpropionic acid, the precursor of 3-phenylpropionylglycine. We found that the use of some antibiotics may alter gut flora, thereby confounding this method of screening for MCAD deficiency. Medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency, one of the most common inherited metabolic disorders, is often mistaken for the sudden infant death syndrome or Reye's syndrome. Diagnosing it has been difficult because of a lack of fast and reliable diagnostic methods. We developed a stable-isotope dilution method to measure urinary n-hexanoylglycine, 3-phenylpropionylglycine, and suberylglycine, and we retrospectively tested its accuracy in diagnosing MCAD deficiency. We measured the concentrations of these three acylglycines in 54 urine samples from 21 patients with confirmed MCAD deficiency during the acute and asymptomatic phases of the illness and compared the results with the concentrations in 98 samples from healthy controls and patient controls with various diseases. The levels of urinary hexanoylglycine and phenylpropionylglycine were significantly increased in all samples from the patients with MCAD deficiency, clearly distinguishing them from both groups of controls. Although urinary suberylglycine was increased in the patients, the range of values in the normal controls who were receiving formula containing medium-chain triglycerides was very wide, overlapping somewhat with the values in the patients with asymptomatic MCAD deficiency. These results indicate that the measurement of urinary hexanoylglycine and phenylpropionylglycine by our method is highly specific for the diagnosis of MCAD deficiency. The method is fast and can be applied to random urine specimens, without any pretreatment of patients.	Phenylpropionylglycine	PUBMED	('INFO', [('INFO', -0.14446629583835602)])

In this study, we sought to investigate the possible effect of Diprotin A TFA on the VE barrier after cerebral ischemic stroke in mice. C57BL/6J mice were divided into five groups, namely, (1) sham, (2) stroke, (3) stroke + dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), (4) stroke + Diprotin A TFA, and (5) stroke + Diprotin A TFA + XAV-939. First, the cerebral ischemia model was established by photothrombotic ischemia, followed by intraperitoneal injection with Diprotin A TFA and XAV-939 at doses of 70 μg/kg and 40 mg/kg 30 min once in the morning and once in the evening for 3 days. Immunofluorescence staining and Western blot methods were used to analyze the expression of vascular and blood-brain barrier (BBB)-associated molecular markers in the peri-infarct area. Compared with the vehicle control group, we found that mice injected with Diprotin A TFA exhibited reduced cerebral infarction volume, increased vascular area and length around the brain injury, increased pericyte and basement membrane coverage, upregulated expression of BBB tight junction proteins, and improved their BBB permeability, whereas the group injected with both drug and inhibitor exhibited significantly aggravated vascular injury and BBB permeability. Diprotin A TFA can reduce VE-cadherin disruption by inhibiting ischemia-hypoxia-induced β-catenin cleavage to protect blood vessels. The dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (DP IV) inhibitor Diprotin A produces a full, dose-dependent, short-lasting and naloxone-reversible analgesia in the rat tail-flick test when given intracerebroventricularly, with an ED50 of 295 nmol/rat but it has no direct opioid agonist activity in the longitudinal muscle strip of guinea-pig ileum bioassay. Two of the potential DP IV substrates, morphiceptin and endomorphin 1, identified recently in bovine brain were also analgesic given by similar route. The action of endomorphin 1 was more potent (ED50 = 7.9 nmol/rat) and slightly but significantly more sustained than that of Diprotin A. Diprotin A neither potentiated nor prolonged the effect of a marginally analgesic dose of endomorphin 1. The distinct time course and the lack of potentiation indicate that in the analgesic effect of Diprotin A in rats the protection of a brain Tyr-Pro-peptide other than endomorphin 1 is involved. The levels of monoamines and their metabolites in brain structures of adult (3-month-old) rats with emotional and motivational disorders induced by inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4; EC 3.4.14.5) diprotin A and sitagliptin on weeks 2-3 of postnatal development (postnatal days 5-18) were studied by HPLC with electrochemical detection. A significant decrease in the level of serotonin metabolite, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, and a pronounced tendency towards reduced serotonin level were detected in the striatum of rats in both study groups. In adult rats treated with diprotin A during the neonatal period, a tendency towards activation of dopamine metabolism was observed (judging from DOPAC/DA ratio). The levels of monoamines and their metabolites in the frontal cortex, hypothalamus, and amygdala remained unchanged. The findings suggest that administration of DPP-4 inhibitors during the neonatal period induces long-term dysfunction of the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems of the brain.

In organic acidemias, and in fatty acid oxidation disorders, specific acylcarnitine species accumulate in a pattern that is characteristic for each disease. For this reason, acylcarnitine analysis is widely used for screening and diagnosis of inherited disorders of metabolism. The most common method for acylcarnitine analysis uses flow injection tandem mass spectrometry. Flow injection analysis allows for high throughput, however, does not provide separation of isomeric and isobaric compounds. Among the acylcarnitine species which can be affected by the presence of isomeric/isobaric compounds, C4-carnitine and C5DC-carnitine are probably the ones encountered most often. The method presented here is performed on urine and utilizes butanolic HCL to derivatize acylcarnitines, ultra-performance liquid chromatography to resolve C4- and C5-DC isomers and isobars, and quantitation of these species using multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM). One of the main challenges of newborn screening programs, which screen for inherited metabolic disorders, is cutting down on false positives (FPs) in order to avoid family stresses, additional analyses, and unnecessary costs. False positives are partly caused by an insubstantial number of robust biomarkers in evaluations. Another challenge is how to distinguish between diseases which share the same primary marker and for which secondary biomarkers are just as highly desirable. Focusing on pathologies that involve butyrylcarnitine (C4) elevation, such as short-chain acylCoA dehydrogenase deficiency (SCADD) and isobutyrylCoA dehydrogenase deficiency (IBDD), we investigated the acylcarnitine profile of 121 newborns with a C4 increase to discover secondary markers to achieve two goals: reduce the FP rate and discriminate between the two rare diseases. Analyses were carried out using tandem mass spectrometry with whole blood samples spotted on filter paper. Seven new biomarkers (C4/C0, C4/C5, C4/C5DC\C6OH, C4/C6, C4/C8, C4/C14:1, C4/C16:1) were identified using a non-parametric ANOVA analysis. Then, the corresponding cut-off values were found and applied to the screening program. The seven new ratios were shown to be robust ( Blood metabolites play an important role in predicting or influencing the occurrence and development of cancers. We aimed to evaluate the relationship between blood metabolites and the occurrence of head and neck cancer (HNC). We employed a Mendelian randomization (MR) approach to investigate the role of blood metabolites in HNC predisposition. The HNC cell line HN30 was treated with butyrylcarnitine, the metabolite identified through MR analysis, and subjected to a series of cellular assays to assess its potential carcinogenic effects. Among the 258 blood metabolites analyzed, butyrylcarnitine emerged as the only metabolite demonstrating a potential causal association with HNC risk following Bonferroni correction (inverse-variance-weighted MR method: β = 0.904, P < 0.001). Genetically predicted higher levels of butyrylcarnitine (log-transformed) were causally linked to an increased risk of HNC (OR: 2.470, 95% CI: 1.530-3.987). Sensitivity analyses, including MR-Egger regression, leave-one-out analysis, and funnel plots, confirmed the robustness of the findings, with no evidence of directional pleiotropy. In vitro experiments further demonstrated that butyrylcarnitine promoted the proliferation, migration and invasion of HN30 cells. By employing a genetic epidemiological framework, our research assessed the impact of metabolite butyrylcarnitine on HNC susceptibility. These findings offer valuable insights into potential therapeutic targets and highlight the promise of targeted metabolic strategies for reducing HNC risk. Nevertheless, further research is required to elucidate the precise biological mechanisms underlying these findings.

The peptides X-Pro-Me3Lys and X-Pro were generated by treatment of the tryptic peptide with thermolysin and carboxypeptidase and the free blocking group X was prepared by acid hydrolysis. Comparison of the 1H-NMR spectra of these peptides with spectra of synthetic N,N-dimethylproline and N,N-dimethylprolylproline demonstrated that the blocking group was indeed N,N-dimethylproline. The 13C-NMR spectrum of the tryptic peptide was consistent with this conclusion although unambiguous assignments to all resonances could not be obtained because of the small amount of material available. The origin of the dimethylproline blocking group is discussed. The complete amino acid sequence (121 residues) of histone H2B from gonads of the starfish Asterias rubens has been established from structural data obtained essentially from large fragments generated by cleavage of histone H2B at aspartyl residues and by limited hydrolysis of the dimer H2A-H2B with mouse submaxillary gland protease. No real sequence homology can be found between the amino-terminal sequence (residues 1-21) of starfish and calf H2B. One non-conservative substitution (serine-32 in calf----lysine-28 in starfish) leads to the presence of a cluster of eight basic residues (sequence 23-30) and to the disappearance of a potential site of phosphorylation. A particular structural feature of starfish histone H2B is the presence of N-dimethylproline at its amino-terminal end. By comparison with N-terminal acetylation, which is commonly found in histones, N-terminal methylation is rarely observed. At the present time the functional significance of the N-terminal methylation as well as that of the proline-rich nature of the amino-terminal sequence of the starfish histone H2B remain to be defined. The complete amino acid sequence (122 residues) of histone H2B from erythrocytes of the marine worm Sipunculus nudus, has been established from sequence analysis of peptides generated by highly specific cleavage of the protein and from the nucleotide sequence of the encoding gene. The isolation of the H2B gene was facilitated by using a highly specific nucleotide probe, devised from amino acids 58-68 of the protein. The presence of an N,N-dimethylproline residue at the amino-terminus of the protein was established from data provided by mass spectrometry and NMR spectroscopy.

We used Mendelian randomization (MR) to screen 207 metabolites for their role in lung cancer predisposition using independent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of blood metabolite levels (n = 7,824) and lung cancer risk (n = 29,266 cases/56,450 controls). A nested case-control study (656 cases and 1,296 matched controls) was subsequently performed using prediagnostic blood samples to validate MR association with lung cancer incidence data from population-based cohorts (EPIC and NSHDS). An MR-based scan of 207 circulating metabolites for lung cancer risk identified that blood isovalerylcarnitine (IVC) was associated with a decreased odds of lung cancer after accounting for multiple testing (log10-OR = 0.43; 95% CI, 0.29-0.63). Molar measurement of IVC in prediagnostic blood found similar results (log10-OR = 0.39; 95% CI, 0.21-0.72). Results were consistent across lung cancer subtypes. Independent lines of evidence support an inverse association of elevated circulating IVC with lung cancer risk through a novel methodologic approach that integrates genetic and traditional epidemiology to efficiently identify novel cancer biomarkers. Our results find compelling evidence in favor of a protective role for a circulating metabolite, IVC, in lung cancer etiology. From the treatment of a Mendelian disease, isovaleric acidemia, we know that circulating IVC is modifiable through a restricted protein diet or glycine and L-carnatine supplementation. IVC may represent a modifiable and inversely associated biomarker for lung cancer. Isovalerylcarnitine (IVC) a product of the catabolism of L-leucine, is a potent activator of the Ca2+-dependent proteinase (calpain) of human neutrophils. At concentrations of Ca2+ in the low micromolar range, activation was 12 to 15-fold, and the activity exceeded that observed with millimolar concentrations of Ca2+ in the absence of the activator. Of the acylcarnitine derivatives tested, IVC was most active; D-isovalerylcarnitine was much less effective and palmitylcarnitine was ineffective. IVC did not increase the activity of calpain that was fully activated by an endogenous cytoskeleton-associated activator protein, but at low concentrations of the latter synergistic effects of the two activators were observed. Activation of neutrophil calpain by IVC is fully reversible. Inhibition by calpastatin was also reversed by IVC. Isovalerylcarnitine, a product of the catabolism of L-leucine, is a potent activator of rat calpains isolated from erythrocytes, kidney, liver, skeletal and heart muscle. Only calpains II, but not calpains I, are activated by IVC, with the only exception of rat erythrocyte calpain I, the only species present in these cells which has a Ca2+ requirement higher than that of most calpain I isoenzymes. Activation by IVC involves a dual effect: 1) a ten fold increase in the affinity of calpain for Ca2+, and 2) an increase in the Vmax 1.3-1.6 fold above the values observed with the native enzymes at saturating [Ca2+] as well as with the autolyzed fully active calpain form at 5 microM Ca2+. The increased affinity for calcium results in an increased rate of autoproteolysis of calpain II. Activation by IVC is additive to that promoted by interaction (or association) to phospholipids vesicles. Together these results suggest that IVC may operate as a selective activator of calpain both in the cytosol and at the membrane level; in the latter case in synergism with the activation induced by association of the proteinase to the cell membrane.

However, the intrinsic fluorescence of biomolecules poses a problem when fluorophores that absorb visible light (350–700 nm) are used. Near-infrared (NIR) fluorescence (700–1,000 nm) detection avoids the natural background fluorescence interference of biomolecules, providing a high contrast between target and background tissues in small animals. NIR fluorophores have a wider dynamic range and minimal background fluorescence as a result of reduced scattering compared with visible fluorescence detection. NIR fluorophores also have high sensitivity, attributable to low background fluorescence, and high extinction coefficients, which provide high quantum yields. The NIR region is also compatible with solid-state optical components, such as diode lasers and silicon detectors. NIR fluorescence imaging is a non-invasive alternative to radionuclide imaging in small animals. Extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesion molecules consist of a complex network of fibronectins, collagens, chondroitins, laminins, glycoproteins, heparin sulfate, tenascins, and proteoglycans that surround connective tissue cells, and they are mainly secreted by fibroblasts, chondroblasts, and osteoblasts (4). Cell substrate adhesion molecules are considered essential regulators of cell migration, differentiation, and tissue integrity and remodeling. These molecules play a role in inflammation and atherogenesis, but they also participate in the process of invasion and metastasis of malignant cells in the host tissue (5). Invasive tumor cells adhere to the ECM, which provides a matrix environment for permeation of tumor cells through the basal lamina and underlying interstitial stroma of the connective tissue. Overexpression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and other proteases by tumor cells allows intravasation of tumor cells into the circulatory system after degrading the basement membrane and ECM (6). Several families of proteases are involved in atherogenesis, myocardial infarction, angiogenesis, and tumor invasion and metastases (7-10). The gelatinase family is a subgroup of MMPs consisting of gelatinase A (MMP-2) and gelatinase B (MMP-9) (11). Gelatinase expression in normal cells, such as trophoblasts, osteoclasts, neutrophils, and macrophages, is highly regulated. Elevated levels of gelatinases have been found in tumors associated with a poor prognosis for cancer patients (12).

Accumulation of trigonelline (c. 240 nmol per pair of cotyledons) was observed in the cotyledons of dry seeds; trigonelline content decreased 2 d after imbibition. Trigonelline content in the embryonic axes increased with seedling growth and reached a peak (c. 380 nmol per embryonic axis) at day 5. Trigonelline content did not change significantly during the differentiation of hypocotyls, and the concentration was greatest in the apical 5 mm. Nicotinic acid and nicotinamide were better precursors for pyridine nucleotide synthesis than quinolinic acid, but no great differences were found in the synthesis of trigonelline from these three precursors. Trigonelline synthesis was always higher in embryonic axes than in cotyledons. Activity of quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.19), nicotinate phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.11), and nicotinamidase (EC 3.5.1.19) was found in cotyledons and embryonic axes, but no nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.12) activity was detected. It follows that quinolinic acid and nicotinic acid were directly converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide by the respective phosphoribosyltransferases, but nicotinamide appeared to be converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide after conversion to nicotinic acid. Trigonelline synthase (nicotinate N-methyltransferase, EC 2.1.1.7) activity increased in the embryonic axes, but decreased in cotyledons during germination. [14C]Nicotinic acid and trigonelline absorbed by the cotyledons were transported to the embryonic axes during germination. Trigonelline had no effect on the growth of seedlings, but nicotinic acid and nicotinamide significantly inhibited the growth of roots. Based on these findings, the role of trigonelline synthesis in mungbean seedlings is discussed. A morphogenetically active compound has been isolated from tissue extract of Hydractinia echinata and identified to be N-methylpicolinic acid (homarine). When applied to whole animals, homarine prevents metamorphosis from larval to adult stage and alters the pattern of adult structures. The concentration of homarine in oocytes is about 25 mM. During embryogenesis, metamorphosis and early colony development the overall homarine content does not change. Adult colonies contain a fourfold lower homarine concentration than larvae. The polyp's head contains twofold more homarine than the gastric region and the stolons. A second, similarly active compound, N-methylnicotinic acid (trigonelline), has also been identified in Hydractinia tissue at concentrations about one-third that of homarine. Incubation of larvae in 10 to 20 microM-homarine or trigonelline prevents head as well as stolon formation. If the compounds are applied in a pulse during metamorphosis, a large part of the available tissue forms stolons. Since microM concentrations of homarine and trigonelline are morphogenetically active, whereas mM concentrations are present in the tissue it appears that both substances are stored within the tissue.

56024.0	('Berberine', 'Umbellatine', 'Berberin', 'Berbericine', 'Majarine')	mouse	Berberine is a quaternary ammonium salt from the protoberberine group of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, occurring naturally as a secondary metabolite in some plants including species of Berberis, from which its name is derived. Due to their yellow pigmentation, raw Berberis materials were once commonly used to dye wool, leather, and wood. Under ultraviolet light, berberine shows a strong yellow fluorescence, making it useful in histology for staining heparin in mast cells. As a natural dye, berberine has a color index of 75160. == Biological sources == The following plants are biological sources of berberine: Berberis vulgaris (barberry) Berberis aristata (tree turmeric) Berberis thunbergii Fibraurea tinctoria Mahonia aquifolium (Oregon grape) Hydrastis canadensis (goldenseal) Xanthorhiza simplicissima (yellowroot) Phellodendron amurense (Amur cork tree) Coptis chinensis (Chinese goldthread) Tinospora cordifolia Argemone mexicana (prickly poppy) Eschscholzia californica (California poppy) Berberine is usually found in the roots, rhizomes, stems, and bark. == Biosynthesis == The alkaloid berberine has a tetracyclic skeleton derived from a benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline system with the incorporation of an extra carbon atom as a bridge. Formation of the berberine bridge is rationalized as an oxidative process in which the N-methyl group, supplied by S-adenosyl methionine (SAM), is oxidized to an iminium ion, and a cyclization to the aromatic ring occurs by virtue of the phenolic group. Reticuline is the immediate precursor of protoberberine alkaloids in plants. Berberine is an alkaloid derived from tyrosine. L-DOPA and 4-hydroxypyruvic acid both come from L-tyrosine. Although two tyrosine molecules are used in the biosynthetic pathway, only the phenethylamine fragment of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring system is formed via DOPA; the remaining carbon atoms come from tyrosine via 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. == Research == Studies on the pharmacological effects of berberine, including medical uses, are preliminary: some studies consider cell cultures or animal models, whereas clinical trials investigating the use of berberine in humans are limited. A 2023 review concluded that berberine may improve lipid concentrations. High-quality, large clinical studies would be required to properly evaluate the effectiveness and safety of berberine in various health conditions. Berberine supplements are widely available in the U.S. but have not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for any specific medical use. Studies linking berberine to health benefits are limited. The quality of berberine supplements can across brands. A 2017 study found that out of 15 different products sold in the U.S., only six contained at least 90% of the specified berberine quantity. == Adverse effects == Longer-term human clinical trials have reported flatulence and diarrhea as common issues. The problem can be replicated in rats, with disruption of the gut microbiome to blame. == Drug interactions == Berberine is known to inhibit the activity of CYP3A4, an important enzyme involved in drug metabolism and clearance of endogenous substances, including steroid hormones such as cortisol, progesterone and testosterone. Several studies have demonstrated that berberine can increase the concentrations of cyclosporine in renal transplant patients and midazolam in healthy adult volunteers, confirming its inhibitory effect on CYP3A4. == Use in China == It is approved in China as an over-the-counter (OTC) drug for diarrhea treatment. The package insert claims efficacy against E. coli and Shigella spp. The Chinese package insert contraindicates berberine for people with hemolytic anemia and with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (G6PD deficiency).

104570.0	('Pc-dag (16:0/18:3)',)	mouse	 In most studies, the alcohol marker phosphatidylethanol (PEth) was used to differentiate social drinking from alcohol abuse. This study investigates PEth's potential in abstinence monitoring by performing a drinking study to assess the detection window of PEth after ingesting a defined amount of alcohol. After 2 weeks of abstinence, 16 volunteers ingested a single dose of alcohol, leading to an estimated blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 1 g/kg. In the week after drinking, blood and urine samples were taken daily; in the second week, samples were taken every other day. PEth 16:0/18:1 and 16:0/18:2 were analyzed in blood by online-SPE-LC-MS/MS. Ethyl glucuronide and ethyl sulfate were determined in urine for abstinence monitoring. Prior to start of drinking, PEth 16:0/18:1 exceeded 30 ng/mL in blood samples of five volunteers despite the requested abstinence period. Positive PEth values resulted from drinking events prior to this abstinence period. After the start of drinking, maximum BACs were reached after 2 h with a mean of 0.80 ± 0.13 g/kg (range: 0.61-1.11 g/kg). PEth 16:0/18:1 increased within 8 h to maximum concentrations (mean: 88.8 ± 47.0 ng/mL, range: 37.2-208 ng/mL). After this event, PEth was detectable for 3 to 12 days with a mean half-life time of approximately 3 days. PEth has a potential in abstinence monitoring, since PEth could be detected for up to 12 days after a single drinking event. Further investigations are necessary, to establish cut-off levels for PEth as diagnostic marker for the determination of drinking habits like abstinence, social drinking, or risky alcohol consumption. Sapienic acid, 16:1n-10 is the most abundant unsaturated fatty acid on human skin where its synthesis is mediated by FADS2 in the sebaceous glands. The FADS2 product introduces a double bond at the Δ6, Δ4 and Δ8 positions by acting on at least ten substrates, including 16:0, 18:2n-6, and 18:3n-3. Our aim was to characterize the competition for accessing FADS2 mediated Δ6 desaturation between 16:0 and the most abundant polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) in the human diet, 18:2n-6 and 18:3n-3, to evaluate whether competition may be relevant in other tissues and thus linked to metabolic abnormalities associated with FADS2 or fatty acid levels. MCF7 cells stably transformed with FADS2 biosynthesize 16:1n-10 from exogenous 16:0 in preference to 16:1n-7, the immediate product of SCD highly expressed in cancer cell lines, and 16:1n-9 via partial β-oxidation of 18:1n-9. Increasing availability of 18:2n-6 or 18:3n-3 resulted in decreased bioconversion of 16:0 to 16:1n-10, simultaneously increasing the levels of highly unsaturated products. FADS2 cells accumulate the desaturation-elongation products 20:3n-6 and 20:4n-3 in preference to the immediate desaturation products 18:3n-6 and 18:4n-3 implying prompt/coupled elongation of the nascent desaturation products. MCF7 cells incorporate newly synthesized 16:1n-10 into phospholipids. These data suggest that excess 16:0 due to, for instance, de novo lipogenesis from high carbohydrate or alcohol consumption, inhibits synthesis of highly unsaturated fatty acids, and may in part explain why supplemental preformed EPA and DHA in some studies improves insulin resistance and other factors related to diabetes and metabolic syndrome aggravated by excess calorie consumption. Plantar fasciitis (PF) is a common foot disorder with variability in treatment strategy. Two effective management techniques include platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections and extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT). The purpose of this meta-analysis is to compare the effectiveness of PRP vs ESWT in the management of PF. A systematic search was performed of PubMed, Cochrane, and Google Scholar for randomized controlled trials comparing PRP to ESWT. Studies met inclusion criteria if mean and SDs for visual analog scale (VAS) pain scores and plantar fascia thickness (PFT) were reported. Mean differences were used to compare VAS pain score and PFT between PRP and ESWT. Six randomized controlled trials, comparing a total of 214 subjects in the PRP group and 218 subjects in the ESWT group, were analyzed. A significantly greater statistical improvement was seen in the PRP group in VAS pain (mean difference = -0.67 [95% CI -1.16, -0.18],  PRP had a statistically higher pain reduction than ESWT, but the difference does not reach clinical significance in this meta-analysis.

79509.0	('Deoxycholic acid', 'Desoxycholic acid', 'Deoxycholate', 'Cholerebic', 'Cholorebic')	mouse	"Deoxycholic acid is a bile acid. Deoxycholic acid is one of the secondary bile acids, which are metabolic byproducts of intestinal bacteria. The two primary bile acids secreted by the liver are cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. Bacteria metabolize chenodeoxycholic acid into the secondary bile acid lithocholic acid, and they metabolize cholic acid into deoxycholic acid. There are additional secondary bile acids, such as ursodeoxycholic acid. Deoxycholic acid is soluble in alcohol and acetic acid. When pure, it exists in a white to off-white crystalline powder form. Deoxycholic acid is available as a generic medication in the United States as of April 2021, sold under the brand name Kybella among others. == Applications == Deoxycholic acid has been used since its discovery in various fields of human medicine. In the human body deoxycholic acid is used in the emulsification of fats for absorption in the intestine. It has, in some countries (including Switzerland) been licensed as an emulsifier in food industry, but it is no longer common. Outside the body it is used in experimental basis of cholagogues and is also in use to prevent and dissolve gallstones. In research deoxycholic acid is used as a mild detergent for the isolation of membrane associated proteins. The critical micelle concentration for deoxycholic acid is approximately 2.4–4 mM. Sodium deoxycholate, the sodium salt of deoxycholic acid, is often used as a biological detergent to lyse cells and solubilise cellular and membrane components. Sodium deoxycholate mixed with phosphatidylcholine, is used in mesotherapy injections to produce lipolysis, and has been used as an alternative to surgical excision in the treatment of lipomas. Deoxycholates and bile acid derivatives in general are actively being studied as structures for incorporation in nanotechnology. They also have found application in microlithography as photoresistant components. In the United States, deoxycholic acid, under the brand name Kybella, is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for reducing moderate-to-severe fat below the chin. When injected into submental fat, deoxycholic acid helps destroy (adipocytes) fat cells, which are metabolized by the body over the course of several months. Kybella is produced by Kythera Biopharmaceuticals. == Research in immunology == Its function as a detergent and isolating agent for membrane proteins also suits it for production of outer membrane protein (OMP) vaccines such as MenB, a Norwegian vaccine developed in the early 1990s. The MeNZB vaccine was produced using the same method. Deoxycholic acid binds and activates the membrane enzyme NAPE-PLD, which catalyzes the release of the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide and other N-acylethanolamines. These bioactive signaling molecules play important roles in several physiological pathways including stress and pain response, appetite, and lifespan. Some publications point towards the effect of deoxycholic acid as an immunostimulant of the innate immune system, activating its main actors, the macrophages. According to these publications, a sufficient amount of deoxycholic acid in the human body would correspond with a good immune reaction of the non-specific immune system. Clinical studies conducted in the 1970s and 1980s confirm the expectation that deoxycholic acid is involved in the natural healing processes of local inflammations, different types of herpes, and possibly cancer. == Research in cancer == Deoxycholate and other secondary bile acids cause DNA damage. Secondary bile acids increase intracellular production of reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species resulting in increased oxidative stress and DNA damage. As shown in the figure below, deoxycholate added to the diet of mice increased the level of 8-oxo-dG, an oxidative DNA damage, in the colonic epithelium of mice. When the level of deoxycholate-induced DNA damage is high, DNA repair enzymes that ordinarily reverse DNA damage may not be able to keep up. DNA damage has frequently been proposed as a major cause of cancer. DNA damage can give rise to cancer by causing mutations. When deoxycholate was added to the food of mice so that their feces contained deoxycholate at about the same level present in feces of human on a high fat diet, 45% to 56% of the mice developed colon cancer over the next 10 months, while none of the mice on a diet without deoxycholate developed cancer. Thus, exposure of the colon to deoxycholate may cause cancer in mice. However, this same study reported that, when chlorogenic acid was added to the diet alongside deoxycholate, only 18% of the mice developed colon cancer. Chlorogenic acid is a component of common foods and beverages; coffee contains an average of 53.8 mg chlorogenic acid per 100 ml. Therefore, to consume the level of chlorogenic acid used in the study, a human on a ""standard"" 2000-calorie daily diet (416 g/d; 250g carbs, 100g protein, 66g fat) would need to consume roughly 55 mL of coffee each day, or just under 2 fluid ounces. In humans, higher levels of colonic deoxycholate are associated with higher frequencies of colon cancer. As an example, the fecal deoxycholate concentrations in African Americans (who eat a relatively high fat diet) is more than five times higher than fecal deoxycholate of Native Africans in South Africa (who eat a low fat diet). Male African Americans have a high incidence of colon cancer of 72 per 100,000, while Native Africans in South Africa have a low incidence rate of colon cancer of less than 1 per 100,000, a more than 72-fold difference in rates of colon cancer. A prospective human study investigating the relationship between microbial metabolites and cancer found a strong correlation between circulating deoxycholic acid and colorectal cancer risk in women. == Factors affecting deoxycholate levels == A number of factors, including diet, obesity, and exercise, affect the level of deoxycholate in the human colon. When humans were switched from their usual diet to a meat, egg and cheese based diet for five days, deoxycholate in their feces increased by factors of 2 to 10 fold. Rats fed diets with 30% beef tallow (high fat) had almost 2-fold more deoxycholate in their feces than rats fed 5% beef tallow (low fat). In the same study, adding the further dietary elements of curcumin or caffeic acid to the rats' high fat (30% beef tallow) diet reduced the deoxycholate in their feces to levels comparable to levels seen in the rats on a low fat diet. Curcumin is a component of the spice turmeric, and caffeic acid is a component high in some fruits and spices. Caffeic acid is also a digestive break-down product of chlorogenic acid, high in coffee and some fruits and vegetables. In addition to fats, the type or amount of protein in the diet may also affect bile acid levels. Switching from a diet with protein provided by casein to a diet with protein provided by salmon protein hydrolysate led to as much as a 6-fold increase in levels of bile acids in the blood plasma of rats. In humans, adding high protein to a high fat diet raised the level of deoxycholate in the plasma by almost 50%. Obesity has been linked to cancer, and this link is in part through deoxycholate. In obese people, the relative proportion of Firmicutes (Gram-positive bacteria) in gut microbiota is increased resulting in greater conversion of the non-genotoxic primary bile acid, cholic acid, to carcinogenic deoxycholate. Exercise decreases deoxycholate in the colon. Humans whose level of physical activity placed them in the top third had a 17% decrease in fecal bile acid concentration compared to those whose level of physical activity placed them in the lowest third. Rats provided with an exercise wheel had a lower ratio of secondary bile acids to primary bile acids than sedentary rats in their feces. There is a positive association of exercise and physical activity with cancer prevention, tolerance to cancer-directed therapies (radiation and chemotherapy), reduction in recurrence, and improvement in survival. == References =="	Deoxycholic acid	WIKIPEDIA	('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('END', -0.5760754346847534), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -2.5776860184123507e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (' MED', -0.10025239735841751), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.07894828915596008), (' FOOD', -0.037178799510002136), (',', -0.3874434530735016), (' INDUSTR', -0.0037183654494583607), ('IAL', 0.0)])

We have assessed a series of endogenous lipids as inhibitors of GlyT1 and GlyT2. Human GlyT1 and GlyT2 were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, and the inhibitory actions of a series of acylcarnitines on glycine transport were measured using electrophysiological techniques. Oleoyl-L-carnitine inhibited glycine transport by GlyT2, with an IC(50) of 340 nM, which is 15-fold more potent than the previously identified lipid inhibitor N-arachidonyl-glycine. Oleoyl-L-carnitine had a slow onset of inhibition and a slow washout. Using a series of chimeric GlyT1/2 transporters and point mutant transporters, we have identified an isoleucine residue in extracellular loop 4 of GlyT2 that conferred differences in sensitivity to oleoyl-L-carnitine between GlyT2 and GlyT1.

It is called tyrosyl when referred to as a functional group or side chain. While tyrosine is generally classified as a hydrophobic amino acid, it is more hydrophilic than phenylalanine. It is encoded by the codons UAC and UAU in messenger RNA. The one-letter symbol Y was assigned to tyrosine for being alphabetically nearest of those letters available. Note that T was assigned to the structurally simpler threonine, U was avoided for its similarity with V for valine, W was assigned to tryptophan, while X was reserved for undetermined or atypical amino acids. The mnemonic tYrosine was also proposed. == Functions == Aside from being a proteinogenic amino acid, tyrosine has a special role by virtue of the phenol functionality. Its hydroxy group is able to form the ester linkage, with phosphate in particular. Phosphate groups are transferred to tyrosine residues by way of protein kinases. This is one of the post-translational modifications. Phosphorylated tyrosine occurs in proteins that are part of signal transduction processes. Similar functionality is also presented in serine and threonine, whose side chains have a hydroxy group, but are alcohols. Phosphorylation of these three amino acids' moieties (including tyrosine) creates a negative charge on their ends, that is greater than the negative charge of the only negatively charged aspartic and glutamic acids. Phosphorylated proteins keep these same properties—which are useful for more reliable protein-protein interactions—by means of phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. Binding sites for a signalling phosphoprotein may be diverse in their chemical structure. Phosphorylation of the hydroxyl group can change the activity of the target protein, or may form part of a signaling cascade via SH2 domain binding. A tyrosine residue also plays an important role in photosynthesis. In chloroplasts (photosystem II), it acts as an electron donor in the reduction of oxidized chlorophyll. In this process, it loses the hydrogen atom of its phenolic OH-group. This radical is subsequently reduced in the photosystem II by the four core manganese clusters. == Dietary requirements and sources == The Dietary Reference Intake for tyrosine is usually estimated together with phenylalanine. It varies depending on an estimate method, however the ideal proportion of these two amino acids is considered to be 60:40 (phenylalanine:tyrosine) as a human body has such composition. Tyrosine, which can also be synthesized in the body from phenylalanine, is found in many high-protein food products such as meat, fish, cheese, cottage cheese, milk, yogurt, peanuts, almonds, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, soy protein and lima beans. For example, the white of an egg has about 250 mg per egg, while beef, lamb, pork, tuna, salmon, chicken, and turkey contain about 500–1000 mg per 3 ounces (85 g) portion. == Biosynthesis == In plants and most microorganisms, tyrosine is produced via prephenate, an intermediate on the shikimate pathway. Prephenate is oxidatively decarboxylated with retention of the hydroxyl group to give p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, which is transaminated using glutamate as the nitrogen source to give tyrosine and α-ketoglutarate. Mammals synthesize tyrosine from the essential amino acid phenylalanine (Phe), which is derived from food. The conversion of Phe to Tyr is catalyzed by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, a monooxygenase. This enzyme catalyzes the reaction causing the addition of a hydroxyl group to the end of the 6-carbon aromatic ring of phenylalanine, such that it becomes tyrosine. == Metabolism == === Phosphorylation and sulfation === Some of the tyrosine residues can be tagged (at the hydroxyl group) with a phosphate group (phosphorylated) by protein kinases. In its phosphorylated form, tyrosine is called phosphotyrosine. Tyrosine phosphorylation is considered to be one of the key steps in signal transduction and regulation of enzymatic activity. Phosphotyrosine can be detected through specific antibodies. Tyrosine residues may also be modified by the addition of a sulfate group, a process known as tyrosine sulfation. Tyrosine sulfation is catalyzed by tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST). Like the phosphotyrosine antibodies mentioned above, antibodies have recently been described that specifically detect sulfotyrosine. === Precursor to neurotransmitters and hormones === In dopaminergic cells in the brain, tyrosine is converted to L-DOPA by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). TH is the rate-limiting enzyme involved in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine can then be converted into other catecholamines, such as norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline). The thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) in the colloid of the thyroid are also derived from tyrosine. === Precursor to other compounds === The latex of Papaver somniferum, the opium poppy, has been shown to convert tyrosine into the alkaloid morphine and the bio-synthetic pathway has been established from tyrosine to morphine by using Carbon-14 radio-labelled tyrosine to trace the in-vivo synthetic route.Tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) is an enzyme in the natural phenols biosynthesis pathway. It transforms L-tyrosine into p-coumaric acid. Tyrosine is also the precursor to the pigment melanin. Tyrosine (or its precursor phenylalanine) is needed to synthesize the benzoquinone structure which forms part of coenzyme Q10. === Degradation === The decomposition of L-tyrosine (syn. para-hydroxyphenylalanine) begins with an α-ketoglutarate dependent transamination through the tyrosine transaminase to para-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. The positional description para, abbreviated p, mean that the hydroxyl group and side chain on the phenyl ring are across from each other (see the illustration below). The next oxidation step catalyzes by p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase and splitting off CO2 homogentisate (2,5-dihydroxyphenyl-1-acetate). In order to split the aromatic ring of homogentisate, a further dioxygenase, homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase is required. Thereby, through the incorporation of a further O2 molecule, maleylacetoacetate is created. Fumarylacetoacetate is created by maleylacetoacetate cis-trans-isomerase through rotation of the carboxyl group created from the hydroxyl group via oxidation. This cis-trans-isomerase contains glutathione as a coenzyme. Fumarylacetoacetate is finally split by the enzyme fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase through the addition of a water molecule. Thereby fumarate (also a metabolite of the citric acid cycle) and acetoacetate (3-ketobutyroate) are liberated. Acetoacetate is a ketone body, which is activated with succinyl-CoA, and thereafter it can be converted into acetyl-CoA, which in turn can be oxidized by the citric acid cycle or be used for fatty acid synthesis. Phloretic acid is also a urinary metabolite of tyrosine in rats. == Ortho- and meta-tyrosine == Three structural isomers of L-tyrosine are known. In addition to the common amino acid L-tyrosine, which is the para isomer (para-tyr, p-tyr or 4-hydroxyphenylalanine), there are two additional regioisomers, namely meta-tyrosine (also known as 3-hydroxyphenylalanine, L-m-tyrosine, and m-tyr) and ortho-tyrosine (o-tyr or 2-hydroxyphenylalanine), that occur in nature. The m-tyr and o-tyr isomers, which are rare, arise through non-enzymatic free-radical hydroxylation of phenylalanine under conditions of oxidative stress. == Medical use == Tyrosine is a precursor to neurotransmitters and increases plasma neurotransmitter levels (particularly dopamine and norepinephrine), but has little if any effect on mood in normal subjects. A 2015 systematic review found that ""tyrosine loading acutely counteracts decrements in working memory and information processing that are induced by demanding situational conditions such as extreme weather or cognitive load"" and therefore ""tyrosine may benefit healthy individuals exposed to demanding situational conditions"". == Industrial synthesis == L-Tyrosine is used in pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, and food additives. Two methods were formerly used to manufacture L-tyrosine. The first involves the extraction of the desired amino acid from protein hydrolysates using a chemical approach. The second utilizes enzymatic synthesis from phenolics, pyruvate, and ammonia through the use of tyrosine phenol-lyase. Advances in genetic engineering and the advent of industrial fermentation have shifted the synthesis of L-tyrosine to the use of engineered strains of E. coli. == See also == Albinism Alkaptonuria Betalain Iodinated tyrosine derivatives Pauly reaction Tyramine Tyrosine sulfation Tyrosinemia == References == == External links == Tyrosine MS Spectrum Tyrosine metabolism Archived 2019-07-26 at the Wayback Machine Phenylalanine and tyrosine biosynthesis Phenylalanine, Tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis Archived 2021-05-06 at the Wayback Machine"	Tyrosine	WIKIPEDIA	('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('END', -0.004626172594726086), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -4.5491004129871726e-05), ('US', 0.0), (',', -4.320199877838604e-07), (' FOOD', -0.007609586231410503), (',', -0.048610758036375046), (' MED', -0.254640132188797), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.10030144453048706), (' INDUSTR', -0.0076147946529090405), ('IAL', 0.0)])
4086.0	('Pantothenic acid', 'Vitamin b5', 'Pantothenate', 'Chick antidermatitis factor', '(r)-pantothenate')	mouse	"Pantothenic acid (vitamin B5) is a B vitamin and an essential nutrient. All animals need pantothenic acid in order to synthesize coenzyme A (CoA), which is essential for cellular energy production and for the synthesis and degradation of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Pantothenic acid is the combination of pantoic acid and β-alanine. Its name comes from the Greek πάντοθεν pantothen, meaning ""from everywhere"", because pantothenic acid, at least in small amounts, is in almost all foods. Deficiency of pantothenic acid is very rare in humans. In dietary supplements and animal feed, the form commonly used is calcium pantothenate, because chemically it is more stable, and hence makes for longer product shelf-life, than sodium pantothenate and free pantothenic acid. == Definition == Pantothenic acid is a water-soluble vitamin, one of the B vitamins. It is synthesized from the amino acid β-alanine and pantoic acid (see biosynthesis and structure of coenzyme A figures). Unlike vitamin E or vitamin K, which occurs in several chemically related forms known as vitamers, pantothenic acid is only one chemical compound. It is a starting compound in the synthesis of coenzyme A (CoA), a cofactor for many enzyme processes. == Use in biosynthesis of coenzyme A == Pantothenic acid is a precursor to CoA via a five-step process. The biosynthesis requires pantothenic acid, cysteine, and four equivalents of ATP (see figure). Pantothenic acid is phosphorylated to 4′-phosphopantothenate by the enzyme pantothenate kinase. This is the committed step in CoA biosynthesis and requires ATP. A cysteine is added to 4′-phosphopantothenate by the enzyme phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase to form 4'-phospho-N-pantothenoylcysteine (PPC). This step is coupled with ATP hydrolysis. PPC is decarboxylated to 4′-phosphopantetheine by phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase 4′-Phosphopantetheine is adenylated (or more properly, AMPylated) to form dephospho-CoA by the enzyme phosphopantetheine adenylyl transferase Finally, dephospho-CoA is phosphorylated to coenzyme A by the enzyme dephosphocoenzyme A kinase. This final step also requires ATP. This pathway is suppressed by end-product inhibition, meaning that CoA is a competitive inhibitor of pantothenate kinase, the enzyme responsible for the first step. Coenzyme A is necessary in the reaction mechanism of the citric acid cycle. This process is the body's primary catabolic pathway and is essential in breaking down the building blocks of the cell such as carbohydrates, amino acids and lipids, for fuel. CoA is important in energy metabolism for pyruvate to enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) as acetyl-CoA, and for α-ketoglutarate to be transformed to succinyl-CoA in the cycle. CoA is also required for acylation and acetylation, which, for example, are involved in signal transduction, and various enzyme functions. In addition to functioning as CoA, this compound can act as an acyl group carrier to form acetyl-CoA and other related compounds; this is a way to transport carbon atoms within the cell. CoA is also required in the formation of acyl carrier protein (ACP), which is required for fatty acid synthesis. Its synthesis also connects with other vitamins such as thiamin and folic acid. == Dietary recommendations == The US Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for B vitamins in 1998. At that time, there was not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs for pantothenic acid. In instances such as this, the Board sets Adequate Intakes (AIs), with the understanding that at some later date, AIs may be replaced by more exact information. The current AI for teens and adults ages 14 and up is 5 mg/day. This was based in part on the observation that for a typical diet, urinary excretion was approximately 2.6 mg/day, and that bioavailability of food-bound pantothenic acid was roughly 50%. AI for pregnancy is 6 mg/day. AI for lactation is 7 mg/day. For infants up to 12 months, the AI is 1.8 mg/day. For children ages 1–13 years, the AI increases with age from 2 to 4 mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). While for many nutrients, the US Department of Agriculture uses food composition data combined with food consumption survey results to estimate average consumption, the surveys and reports do not include pantothenic acid in the analyses. Less formal estimates of adult daily intakes report about 4 to 7 mg/day. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL are defined the same as in the US. For women and men over age 11, the Adequate Intake (AI) is set at 5 mg/day. AI for pregnancy is 5 mg/day, for lactation 7 mg/day. For children ages 1–10 years, the AI is 4 mg/day. These AIs are similar to the US AIs. === Safety === As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of pantothenic acid, there is no UL, as there is no human data for adverse effects from high doses. The EFSA also reviewed the safety question and reached the same conclusion as in the United States – that there was not sufficient evidence to set a UL for pantothenic acid. === Labeling requirements === For US food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For pantothenic acid labeling purposes, 100% of the Daily Value was 10 mg, but as of May 2016 it was revised to 5 mg to bring it into agreement with the AI. Compliance with the updated labeling regulations was required by January 2020 for manufacturers with US$10 million or more in annual food sales, and by January 2021 for manufacturers with lower volume food sales. A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at Reference Daily Intake. == Sources == === Dietary === Food sources of pantothenic acid include animal-sourced foods, including dairy foods and eggs. Potatoes, tomato products, oat-cereals, sunflower seeds, avocado are good plant sources. Mushrooms are good sources, too. Whole grains are another source of the vitamin, but milling to make white rice or white flour removes much of the pantothenic acid, as it is found in the outer layers of whole grains. In animal feeds, the most important sources are alfalfa, cereal, fish meal, peanut meal, molasses, rice bran, wheat bran, and yeasts. === Supplements === Dietary supplements of pantothenic acid commonly use pantothenol (or panthenol), a shelf-stable analog, which is converted to pantothenic acid once consumed. Calcium pantothenate – a salt – may be used in manufacturing because it is more resistant than pantothenic acid to factors that deteriorate stability, such as acid, alkali or heat. The amount of pantothenic acid in dietary supplement products may contain up to 1,000 mg (200 times the Adequate Intake level for adults), without evidence that such large amounts provide any benefit. According to WebMD, pantothenic acid supplements have a long list of claimed uses, but there is insufficient scientific evidence to support any of them. As a dietary supplement, pantothenic acid is not the same as pantethine, which is composed of two pantothenic acid molecules linked by a disulfide bridge. Sold as a high-dose supplement (600 mg), pantethine may be effective for lowering blood levels of LDL cholesterol – a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases – but its long-term effects are unknown, so use should be supervised by a physician. Dietary supplementation with pantothenic acid does not have the cholesterol-lowering effect as pantethine. === Fortification === According to the Global Fortification Data Exchange, pantothenic acid deficiency is so rare that no countries require that foods be fortified. == Absorption, metabolism and excretion == When found in foods, most pantothenic acid is in the form of CoA or bound to acyl carrier protein (ACP). For the intestinal cells to absorb this vitamin, it must be converted into free pantothenic acid. Within the lumen of the intestine, CoA and ACP are hydrolyzed into 4'-phosphopantetheine. The 4'-phosphopantetheine is then dephosphorylated into pantetheine. Pantetheinase, an intestinal enzyme, then hydrolyzes pantetheine into free pantothenic acid. Free pantothenic acid is absorbed into intestinal cells via a saturable, sodium-dependent active transport system. At high levels of intake, when this mechanism is saturated, some pantothenic acid may also be additionally absorbed via passive diffusion. As a whole, when intake increases 10-fold, absorption rate decreases to 10%. Pantothenic acid is excreted in urine. This occurs after its release from CoA. Urinary amounts are on the order of 2.6 mg/day, but decreased to negligible amounts when subjects in multi-week experimental situations were fed diets devoid of the vitamin. == Deficiency == Pantothenic acid deficiency in humans is very rare and has not been thoroughly studied. In the few cases where deficiency has been seen (prisoners of war during World War II, victims of starvation, or limited volunteer trials), nearly all symptoms were reversed with orally administered pantothenic acid. Symptoms of deficiency are similar to other vitamin B deficiencies. There is impaired energy production, due to low CoA levels, which could cause symptoms of irritability, fatigue, and apathy. Acetylcholine synthesis is also impaired; therefore, neurological symptoms can also appear in deficiency; they include sensation of numbness in hands and feet, paresthesia and muscle cramps. Additional symptoms could include restlessness, malaise, sleep disturbances, nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps. In animals, symptoms include disorders of the nervous, gastrointestinal, and immune systems, reduced growth rate, decreased food intake, skin lesions and changes in hair coat, and alterations in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. In rodents, there can be loss of hair color, which led to marketing of pantothenic acid as a dietary supplement which could prevent or treat graying of hair in humans (despite the lack of any human trial evidence). Pantothenic acid status can be assessed by measuring either whole blood concentration or 24-hour urinary excretion. In humans, whole blood values less than 1 μmol/L are considered low, as is urinary excretion of less than 4.56 mmol/day. == Animal nutrition == Calcium pantothenate and dexpanthenol (D-panthenol) are European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) approved additives to animal feed. Supplementation is on the order of 8–20 mg/kg for pigs, 10–15 mg/kg for poultry, 30–50 mg/kg for fish and 8–14 mg/kg feed for pets. These are recommended concentrations, designed to be higher than what are thought to be requirements. There is some evidence that feed supplementation increases pantothenic acid concentration in tissues, i.e., meat, consumed by humans, and also for eggs, but this raises no concerns for consumer safety. No dietary requirement for pantothenic acid has been established in ruminant species. Synthesis of pantothenic acid by ruminal microorganisms appears to be 20 to 30 times more than dietary amounts. Net microbial synthesis of pantothenic acid in the rumen of steer calves has been estimated to be 2.2 mg/kg of digestible organic matter consumed per day. Supplementation of pantothenic acid at 5 to 10 times theoretical requirements did not improve growth performance of feedlot cattle. == Synthesis == === Biosynthesis === Bacteria synthesize pantothenic acid from the amino acids aspartate and a precursor to the amino acid valine. Aspartate is converted to β-alanine. The amino group of valine is replaced by a keto-moiety to yield α-ketoisovalerate, which, in turn, forms α-ketopantoate following transfer of a methyl group, then D-pantoate (also known as pantoic acid) following reduction. β-alanine and pantoic acid are then condensed to form pantothenic acid (see figure). === Industrial synthesis === The industrial synthesis of pantothenic acid starts with the aldol condensation of isobutyraldehyde and formaldehyde. The resulting hydroxypivaldehyde is converted to its cyanohydrin derivative. which is cyclised to give racemic pantolactone. This sequence of reactions was first published in 1904. Synthesis of the vitamin is completed by resolution of the lactone using quinine, for example, followed by treatment with the calcium or sodium salt of β-alanine. == History == The term vitamin is derived from the word vitamine, which was coined in 1912 by Polish biochemist Casimir Funk, who isolated a complex of water-soluble micronutrients essential to life, all of which he presumed to be amines. When this presumption was later determined not to be true, the ""e"" was dropped from the name, hence ""vitamin"". Vitamin nomenclature was alphabetical, with Elmer McCollum calling these fat-soluble A and water-soluble B. Over time, eight chemically distinct, water-soluble B vitamins were isolated and numbered, with pantothenic acid as vitamin B5. The essential nature of pantothenic acid was discovered by Roger J. Williams in 1933 by showing it was required for the growth of yeast. Three years later Elvehjem and Jukes demonstrated that it was a growth and anti-dermatitis factor in chickens. Williams dubbed the compound ""pantothenic acid"", deriving the name from the Greek word pantothen, which translates as ""from everywhere"". His reason was that he found it to be present in almost every food he tested. Williams went on to determine the chemical structure in 1940. In 1953, Fritz Lipmann shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine ""for his discovery of co-enzyme A and its importance for intermediary metabolism"", work he had published in 1946. == References =="	Pantothenic acid	WIKIPEDIA	('FOOD', [('FO', -0.0034726131707429886), ('OD', 0.0)])
72731.0	('Valsartan', 'Diovan', 'Tareg', 'Cgp 48933', 'Provas')	mouse	Valsartan, sold under the brand name Diovan among others, is a medication used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and diabetic kidney disease. It belongs to a class of medications referred to as angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). It is a reasonable initial treatment for high blood pressure. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include feeling tired, dizziness, high blood potassium, diarrhea, and joint pain. Other serious side effects may include kidney problems, low blood pressure, and angioedema. Use in pregnancy may harm the baby and use when breastfeeding is not recommended. It is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist and works by blocking the effects of angiotensin II. Valsartan was patented in 1990, and came into medical use in 1996. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 117th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Valsartan is used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and to reduce death for people with left ventricular dysfunction after having a heart attack. === High blood pressure === Valsartan (and other ARBs) are an appropriate initial treatment option for most people with high blood pressure and no other coexisting conditions, as are ACE inhibitors, thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers. If patients have coexisting diabetes or kidney disease, ARBs or ACE inhibitors may be considered over other classes of blood pressure medicines. === Heart failure === Valsartan has reduced rates of mortality and heart failure hospitalisations when used alone or in combination with beta blockers in the treatment of heart failure. Importantly, the combination of valsartan and ACE inhibitors has not shown morbidity or mortality benefits but rather increases mortality risk when added to combination beta blocker and ACE inhibitor therapy, and increases the risk of adverse events like hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal failure. As shown in the PARADIGM-HF study, valsartan combined with sacubitril for the treatment of heart failure, significantly reduced all cause and cardiovascular mortality and hospitalisations due to heart failure. === Diabetic kidney disease === In people with type 2 diabetes, antihypertensive therapy with valsartan decreases the rate of progression of albuminuria (albumin in urine), promotes regression to normoalbuminuria and may reduce the rate of progression to end-stage kidney disease. == Contraindications == The packaging for valsartan includes a warning stating the drug should not be used with the renin inhibitor aliskiren in people with diabetes. It also states the safety of the drug in severe renal impairment has not been established. Valsartan includes a black box warning for fetal toxicity. Discontinuation of these agents is recommended immediately after detection of pregnancy and an alternative medication should be started. Breastfeeding is not recommended. == Side effects == Side effects depend on the reason the medication is being used. === Heart failure === Adverse effects are based on a comparison versus placebo in people with heart failure. Most common side effects include dizziness (17% vs 9% ), low blood pressure (7% vs 2%), and diarrhea (5% vs 4%). Less common side effects include joint pain, fatigue, and back pain (all 3% vs 2%). === Hypertension === Clinical trials for valsartan treatment for hypertension versus placebo demonstrate side effects like viral infection (3% vs 2%), fatigue (2% vs 1%) and abdominal pain (2% vs 1%). Minor side effects that occurred at >1% but were similar to rates from the placebo group include: headache dizziness upper respiratory infection cough diarrhea rhinitis/sinusitis nausea pharyngitis edema arthralgia === Kidney failure === People treated with ARBs including valsartan or diuretics are susceptible to conditions of developing low renal blood flow such as abnormal narrowing of blood vessels in the kidney, hypertension, renal artery stenosis, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion whose renal function is in part dependent on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system like efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction done by angiotensin II are at high risk of deterioration of renal function comprising acute kidney failure, oliguria, worsening azotemia or heightened serum creatinine. When blood flow to the kidneys is reduced, the kidney activates a series of responses that triggers angiotensin release to constrict blood vessels and facilitate blood flow in the kidney. So long as the nephron function degradation is progressive or reaches clinically significant levels, withholding or discontinuing valsartan is warranted. == Interactions == The US prescribing information lists the following drug interactions for valsartan: Other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system may increase the risks of low blood pressure, kidney problems, and hyperkalemia. Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium may increase the risk of hyperkalemia. NSAIDs may increase the risk of kidney problems and may interfere with blood pressure-lowering effects. Valsartan may increase the concentration of lithium. Valsartan and other angiotensin-related blood pressure medications may interact with the antibiotics co-trimoxazole or ciprofloxacin to increase risk of sudden death due to cardiac arrest. === Food interaction === With the tablet, food decreases the valsartan tablet taker's exposure to valsartan by about 40% and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50%, evidenced by AUC change. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Valsartan blocks the actions of angiotensin II, which include constricting blood vessels and activating aldosterone, to reduce blood pressure. The drug binds to angiotensin type I receptors (AT1), working as an antagonist. This mechanism of action is different than that of the ACE inhibitor drugs, which block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. As valsartan acts at the receptor, it can provide more complete angiotensin II antagonism since angiotensin II is generated by other enzymes as well as ACE. Also, valsartan does not affect the metabolism of bradykinin like ACE inhibitors do. === Pharmacodynamics === === Pharmacokinetics === The peak concentration of valsartan in plasma occurs 2 to 4 hours after dosing. AUC and Cmax values of valsartan are observed to be approximately linearly dose-dependent over therapeutic dosing range. Owing to its relatively short elimination half life attribution, valsartan concentration in plasma does not accumulate in response to repeated dosing. == Society and culture == === Economics === In 2010, valsartan (trade name Diovan) achieved annual sales of $2.052 billion in the United States and $6.053 billion worldwide. The patents for valsartan and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide expired in September 2012. === Combinations === Versions are available as the combinations valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/amlodipine, valsartan/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/nebivolol, and valsartan/sacubitril. Valsartan is combined with amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) (or both) into single-pill formulations for treating hypertension with multiple drugs. Valsartan is also available as the combination valsartan/sacubitril. It is used to treat heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. === Recalls === In July 2018, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recalled certain batches of valsartan and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide film-coated tablets distributed in 22 countries in the European Union. Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical Co. (ZHP) in Linhai, China manufactured the bulk ingredient contaminated by N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a carcinogen. The active pharmaceutical ingredient was subsequently imported by a number of generic drugmakers, including Novartis, and marketed in Europe and Asia under their subsidiary Sandoz labeling, and in the UK by Dexcel Pharma Ltd and Accord Healthcare. Valsartan was recalled in Canada. Authorities believe the degree of contamination is negligible. In July 2018, The National Agency of Drug and Food Control (NA-DFC or Badan POM Indonesia) announced voluntary recalls for two products containing valsartan produced by Actavis Indonesia and Dipa Pharmalab Intersains. In July 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced voluntary recalls of certain supplies of valsartan and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide in the US distributed by Solco Healthcare LLC, Major Pharmaceuticals, and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. Hong Kong's Department of Health initiated a similar recall. In August 2018, the FDA published two lengthy, updated lists, classifying hundreds of specific US products containing valsartan into those included versus excluded from the recall. A week later, the FDA cited two more drugmakers, Zhejiang Tianyu Pharmaceuticals of China and Hetero Labs Limited of India, as additional sources of the contaminated valsartan ingredient. In September 2018, the FDA announced that retesting of all valsartan supplies had found a second carcinogenic impurity, N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), in the recalled products made by ZHP in China and marketed in the US under the Torrent Pharmaceuticals (India) brand. According to a 2018 Reuters analysis of national medicines agencies' records, more than 50 companies around the world have recalled valsartan mono-preparations or combination products manufactured from the tainted valsartan ingredient. The contamination has likely been present since 2012 when the manufacturing process was changed and approved by EDQM and FDA authorities. Based on inspections in late 2018, both agencies have suspended the Chinese and Indian manufacturers' certificates of suitability for the supply of valsartan in the EU and the US. In 2019, many more preparations of valsartan and its combinations were recalled due to the presence of the contaminant NDMA. In August 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) provided guidance to marketing authorization holders on how to avoid the presence of nitrosamine impurities in human medicines and asked them to review all chemical and biological human medicines for the possible presence of nitrosamines and to test the products at risk. The FDA issued revised guidelines about nitrosamine impurities in September 2024. === Shortages === Since July 2018, numerous recalls of losartan, valsartan and irbesartan drug products have caused marked shortages of these life saving medications in North America and Europe, particularly for valsartan. In March 2019, the FDA approved an additional generic version of valsartan to address the issue. According to the agency, the shortage of valsartan was resolved in April 2020, but the availability of the generic form remained unstable into July 2020. Pharmacies in the European Union were notified that the supply of the drug, particularly for higher dosage forms, would remain unstable well into December 2020. == Research == In people with impaired glucose tolerance, valsartan may decrease the incidence of developing diabetes mellitus type 2. However, the absolute risk reduction is small (less than 1 percent per year) and diet, exercise or other drugs, may be more protective. In the same study, no reduction in the rate of cardiovascular events (including death) was shown.

54575.0	"('Daidzein', 'Daidzeol', 'K 251b', 'Einecs 207-635-4', ""Isoflavone, 4',7-dihydroxy-"")"	mouse	Daidzein (7-hydroxy-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-4H-chromen-4-one) is a naturally occurring compound found exclusively in soybeans and other legumes and structurally belongs to a class of compounds known as isoflavones. Daidzein and other isoflavones are produced in plants through the phenylpropanoid pathway of secondary metabolism and are used as signal carriers, and defense responses to pathogenic attacks. In humans, recent research has shown the viability of using daidzein in medicine for menopausal relief, osteoporosis, blood cholesterol, and lowering the risk of some hormone-related cancers, and heart disease. Despite the known health benefits, the use of both puerarin and daidzein is limited by their poor bioavailability and low water solubility. == Natural occurrence == Daidzein and other isoflavone compounds, such as genistein, are present in a number of plants and herbs like kwao krua (Pueraria mirifica) and kudzu. It can also be found in Maackia amurensis cell cultures. Daidzein can be found in food such as soybeans and soy products like tofu and textured vegetable protein. Soy isoflavones are a group of compounds found in and isolated from the soybean. Of note, total isoflavones in soybeans are—in general—37 percent daidzein, 57 percent genistein and 6 percent glycitein, according to USDA data. Soy germ contains 41.7 percent daidzein. == Biosynthesis == === History === The isoflavonoid pathway has long been studied because of its prevalence in a wide variety of plant species, including as pigmentation in many flowers, as well as serving as signals in plants and microbes. The isoflavone synthase (IFS) enzyme was suggested to be a P-450 oxygenase family, and this was confirmed by Shinichi Ayabe's laboratory in 1999. IFS exists in two isoforms that can use both liquiritigenin and naringenin to give daidzein and genistein respectively. === Pathway === Daidzein is an isoflavonoid derived from the shikimate pathway that forms an oxygen containing heterocycle through a cytochrome P-450-dependent enzyme that is NADPH dependent. The biosynthesis of daidzein begins with L-phenylalanine and undergoes a general phenylpropanoid pathway where the shikimate derived aromatic ring is shifted to the adjacent carbon of the heterocycle. The process begins with phenylalanine ligase (PAL) cleaving the amino group from L-Phe forming the unsaturated carboxylic acid, cinnamic acid. Cinnamic acid is then hydroxylated by membrane protein cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H) to form p-coumaric acid. P-coumaric acid then acts as the starter unit which gets loaded with coenzyme A by 4-coumaroyl:CoA-ligase (4CL). The starter unit (A) then undergoes three iterations of malonyl-CoA resulting in (B), which enzymes chalcone synthase (CHS) and chalcone reductase (CHR) modify to obtain trihydroxychalcone. CHR is NADPH dependent. Chalcone isomerase (CHI) then isomerizes trihydroxychalcone to liquiritigenin, the precursor to daidzein. A radical mechanism has been proposed in order to obtain daidzein from liquiritigenin, where an iron-containing enzyme, as well as NADPH and oxygen cofactors are used by a 2-hydroxyisoflavone synthase to oxidize liquiritigenin to a radical intermediate (C). A 1,2 aryl migration follows to form (D), which is subsequently oxidized to (E). Lastly, dehydration of the hydroxy group on C2 occurs through a 2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase (specifically GmHID1) to give daidzein. == Research == Daidzein has been found to act as an agonist of the GPER (GPR30). == Pathogen interactions == Because daidzein is a defensive factor, Pseudomonas syringae produces the HopZ1b effector which degrades a GmHID1 product. == Derivatives == Glyceollin, a type of phytoalexin === Glycosides === Daidzin is the 7-O-glucoside of daidzein. Puerarin is the 8-C-glucoside of daidzein. == Plants containing daidzein == Maackia amurensis Pueraria montana var. lobata Pueraria thomsonii == References ==	Daidzein	WIKIPEDIA	('FOOD, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.00044068231363780797), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.31331703066825867), (' MED', -0.39791110157966614), ('ICAL', 0.0)])
26213.0	('Riboflavin', 'Vitamin b2', 'Riboflavine', 'Lactoflavin', 'Vitamin g')	mouse	"Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is a vitamin found in food and sold as a dietary supplement. It is essential to the formation of two major coenzymes, flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide. These coenzymes are involved in energy metabolism, cellular respiration, and antibody production, as well as normal growth and development. The coenzymes are also required for the metabolism of niacin, vitamin B6, and folate. Riboflavin is prescribed to treat corneal thinning, and taken orally, may reduce the incidence of migraine headaches in adults. Riboflavin deficiency is rare and is usually accompanied by deficiencies of other vitamins and nutrients. It may be prevented or treated by oral supplements or by injections. As a water-soluble vitamin, any riboflavin consumed in excess of nutritional requirements is not stored; it is either not absorbed or is absorbed and quickly excreted in urine, causing the urine to have a bright yellow tint. Natural sources of riboflavin include meat, fish and fowl, eggs, dairy products, green vegetables, mushrooms, and almonds. Some countries require its addition to grains. In its purified, solid form, it is a water-soluble yellow-orange crystalline powder. In addition to its function as a vitamin, it is used as a food coloring agent. Biosynthesis takes place in bacteria, fungi and plants, but not animals. Industrial synthesis of riboflavin was initially achieved using a chemical process, but current commercial manufacturing relies on fermentation methods using strains of fungi and genetically modified bacteria. == Definition == Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is a water-soluble vitamin and is one of the B vitamins. Unlike folate and vitamin B6, which occur in several chemically related forms known as vitamers, riboflavin is only one chemical compound. It is a starting compound in the synthesis of the coenzymes flavin mononucleotide (FMN, also known as riboflavin-5'-phosphate) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). FAD is the more abundant form of flavin, reported to bind to 75% of the number of flavin-dependent protein encoded genes in the all-species genome (the flavoproteome) and serves as a co-enzyme for 84% of human-encoded flavoproteins. In its purified, solid form, riboflavin is a yellow-orange crystalline powder with a slight odor and bitter taste. It is soluble in polar solvents, such as water and aqueous sodium chloride solutions, and slightly soluble in alcohols. It is not soluble in non-polar or weakly polar organic solvents such as chloroform, benzene or acetone. In solution or during dry storage as a powder, riboflavin is heat stable if not exposed to light. When heated to decompose, it releases toxic fumes containing nitric oxide. == Functions == Riboflavin is essential to the formation of two major coenzymes, FMN and FAD. These coenzymes are involved in energy metabolism, cell respiration, antibody production, growth and development. Riboflavin is essential for the metabolism of carbohydrates, protein and fats. FAD contributes to the conversion of tryptophan to niacin (vitamin B3) and the conversion of vitamin B6 to the coenzyme pyridoxal 5'-phosphate requires FMN. Riboflavin is involved in maintaining normal circulating levels of homocysteine; in riboflavin deficiency, homocysteine levels increase, elevating the risk of cardiovascular diseases. === Redox reactions === Redox reactions are processes that involve the transfer of electrons. The flavin coenzymes support the function of roughly 70-80 flavoenzymes in humans (and hundreds more across all organisms, including those encoded by archeal, bacterial and fungal genomes) that are responsible for one- or two-electron redox reactions which capitalize on the ability of flavins to be converted between oxidized, half-reduced and fully reduced forms. FAD is also required for the activity of glutathione reductase, an essential enzyme in the formation of the endogenous antioxidant, glutathione. === Micronutrient metabolism === Riboflavin, FMN, and FAD are involved in the metabolism of niacin, vitamin B6, and folate. The synthesis of the niacin-containing coenzymes, NAD and NADP, from tryptophan involves the FAD-dependent enzyme, kynurenine 3-monooxygenase. Dietary deficiency of riboflavin can decrease the production of NAD and NADP, thereby promoting niacin deficiency. Conversion of vitamin B6 to its coenzyme, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, involves the enzyme, pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase, which requires FMN. An enzyme involved in folate metabolism, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, requires FAD to form the amino acid, methionine, from homocysteine. Riboflavin deficiency appears to impair the metabolism of the dietary mineral, iron, which is essential to the production of hemoglobin and red blood cells. Alleviating riboflavin deficiency in people who are deficient in both riboflavin and iron improves the effectiveness of iron supplementation for treating iron-deficiency anemia. == Synthesis == === Biosynthesis === Biosynthesis takes place in bacteria, fungi and plants, but not animals. The biosynthetic precursors to riboflavin are ribulose 5-phosphate and guanosine triphosphate. The former is converted to L-3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate while the latter is transformed in a series of reactions that lead to 5-amino-6-(D-ribitylamino)uracil. These two compounds are then the substrates for the penultimate step in the pathway, catalysed by the enzyme lumazine synthase in reaction EC 2.5.1.78. In the final step of the biosynthesis, two molecules of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine are combined by the enzyme riboflavin synthase in a dismutation reaction. This generates one molecule of riboflavin and one of 5-amino-6-(D-ribitylamino) uracil. The latter is recycled to the previous reaction in the sequence. Conversions of riboflavin to the cofactors FMN and FAD are carried out by the enzymes riboflavin kinase and FAD synthetase acting sequentially. === Industrial synthesis === The industrial-scale production of riboflavin uses various microorganisms, including filamentous fungi such as Ashbya gossypii, Candida famata and Candida flaveri, as well as the bacteria Corynebacterium ammoniagenes and Bacillus subtilis. B. subtilis that has been genetically modified to both increase the production of riboflavin and to introduce an antibiotic (ampicillin) resistance marker, is employed at a commercial scale to produce riboflavin for feed and food fortification. By 2012, over 4,000 tonnes per annum were produced by such fermentation processes. In the presence of high concentrations of hydrocarbons or aromatic compounds, some bacteria overproduce riboflavin, possibly as a protective mechanism. One such organism is Micrococcus luteus (American Type Culture Collection strain number ATCC 49442), which develops a yellow color due to production of riboflavin while growing on pyridine, but not when grown on other substrates, such as succinic acid. === Laboratory synthesis === The first total synthesis of riboflavin was carried out by Richard Kuhn's group. A substituted aniline, produced by reductive amination using D-ribose, was condensed with alloxan in the final step: == Uses == === Treatment of corneal thinning === Keratoconus is the most common form of corneal ectasia, a progressive thinning of the cornea. The condition is treated by corneal collagen cross-linking, which increases corneal stiffness. Cross-linking is achieved by applying a topical riboflavin solution to the cornea, which is then exposed to ultraviolet A light. === Migraine prevention === In its 2012 guidelines, the American Academy of Neurology stated that high-dose riboflavin (400 mg) is ""probably effective and should be considered for migraine prevention,"" a recommendation also provided by the UK National Migraine Centre. A 2017 review reported that daily riboflavin taken at 400 mg per day for at least three months may reduce the frequency of migraine headaches in adults. Research on high-dose riboflavin for migraine prevention or treatment in children and adolescents is inconclusive, and so supplements are not recommended. === Food coloring === Riboflavin is used as a food coloring (yellow-orange crystalline powder), and is designated with the E number, E101, in Europe for use as a food additive. == Dietary recommendations == The National Academy of Medicine updated the Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for riboflavin in 1998. The EARs for riboflavin for women and men aged 14 and over are 0.9 mg/day and 1.1 mg/day, respectively; the RDAs are 1.1 and 1.3 mg/day, respectively. RDAs are higher than EARs to provide adequate intake levels for individuals with higher than average requirements. The RDA during pregnancy is 1.4 mg/day and the RDA for lactating females is 1.6 mg/day. For infants up to the age of 12 months, the Adequate Intake (AI) is 0.3–0.4 mg/day and for children aged 1–13 years the RDA increases with age from 0.5 to 0.9 mg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of riboflavin there is no UL, as there is no human data for adverse effects from high doses. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL are defined the same as in United States. For women and men aged 15 and older the PRI is set at 1.6 mg/day. The PRI during pregnancy is 1.9 mg/day and the PRI for lactating females is 2.0 mg/day. For children aged 1–14 years the PRIs increase with age from 0.6 to 1.4 mg/day. These PRIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs. The EFSA also considered the maximum safe intake and like the U.S. National Academy of Medicine, decided that there was not sufficient information to set an UL. === Safety === In humans, there is no evidence for riboflavin toxicity produced by excessive intakes and absorption becomes less efficient as dosage increases. Any excess riboflavin is excreted via the kidneys into urine, resulting in a bright yellow color known as flavinuria. During a clinical trial on the effectiveness of riboflavin for treating the frequency and severity of migraines, subjects were given up to 400 mg of riboflavin orally per day for periods of 3–12 months. Abdominal pains and diarrhea were among the side effects reported. === Labeling === For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For riboflavin labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 1.7 mg, but as of May 27, 2016, it was revised to 1.3 mg to bring it into agreement with the RDA. A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at Reference Daily Intake. == Sources == The United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service maintains a food composition database from which riboflavin content in hundreds of foods can be searched. The white flour produced after milling of wheat has only 67% of its original riboflavin amount left, so white flour is enriched in some countries. Riboflavin is also added to ready-to-eat breakfast cereals. It is difficult to incorporate riboflavin into liquid products because it has poor solubility in water, hence the requirement for riboflavin-5'-phosphate (FMN, also called E101 when used as colorant), a more soluble form of riboflavin. The enrichment of bread and ready-to-eat breakfast cereals contributes significantly to the dietary supply of the vitamin. Free riboflavin is naturally present in animal-sourced foods along with protein-bound FMN and FAD. Cows' milk contains mainly free riboflavin, but both FMN and FAD are present at low concentrations. === Fortification === Some countries require or recommend fortification of grain foods. As of 2024, 57 countries, mostly in North and South America and southeast Africa, require food fortification of wheat flour or maize (corn) flour with riboflavin or riboflavin-5'-phosphate sodium. The amounts stipulated range from 1.3 to 5.75 mg/kg. An additional 16 countries have a voluntary fortification program. For example, the Indian government recommends 4.0 mg/kg for ""maida"" (white) and ""atta"" (whole wheat) flour. == Absorption, metabolism, excretion == More than 90% of riboflavin in the diet is in the form of protein-bound FMN and FAD. Exposure to gastric acid in the stomach releases the coenzymes, which are subsequently enzymatically hydrolyzed in the proximal small intestine to release free riboflavin. Absorption occurs via a rapid active transport system, with some additional passive diffusion occurring at high concentrations. Bile salts facilitate uptake, so absorption is improved when the vitamin is consumed with a meal. The majority of newly absorbed riboflavin is taken up by the liver on the first pass, indicating that postprandial appearance of riboflavin in blood plasma may underestimate absorption. Three riboflavin transporter proteins have been identified: RFVT1 is present in the small intestine and also in the placenta; RFVT2 is highly expressed in brain and salivary glands; and RFVT3 is most highly expressed in the small intestine, testes, and prostate. Infants with mutations in the genes encoding these transport proteins can be treated with riboflavin administered orally. Riboflavin is reversibly converted to FMN and then FAD. From riboflavin to FMN is the function of zinc-requiring riboflavin kinase; the reverse is accomplished by a phosphatase. From FMN to FAD is the function of magnesium-requiring FAD synthase; the reverse is accomplished by a pyrophosphatase. FAD appears to be an inhibitory end-product that down-regulates its own formation. When excess riboflavin is absorbed by the small intestine, it is quickly removed from the blood and excreted in urine. Urine color is used as a hydration status biomarker and, under normal conditions, correlates with urine specific gravity and urine osmolality. However, riboflavin supplementation in large excess of requirements causes urine to appear more yellow than normal. With normal dietary intake, about two-thirds of urinary output is riboflavin, the remainder having been partially metabolized to hydroxymethylriboflavin from oxidation within cells, and as other metabolites. When consumption exceeds the ability to absorb, riboflavin passes into the large intestine, where it is catabolized by bacteria to various metabolites that can be detected in feces. There is speculation that unabsorbed riboflavin could affect the large intestine microbiome. == Deficiency == === Prevalence === Riboflavin deficiency is uncommon in the United States and in other countries with wheat flour or corn meal fortification programs. From data collected in biannual surveys of the U.S. population, for ages 20 and over, 22% of women and 19% of men reported consuming a supplement that contained riboflavin, typically a vitamin-mineral multi-supplement. For the non-supplement users, the dietary intake of adult women averaged 1.74 mg/day and men 2.44 mg/day. These amounts exceed the RDAs for riboflavin of 1.1 and 1.3 mg/day respectively. For all age groups, on average, consumption from food exceeded the RDAs. A 2001-02 U.S. survey reported that less than 3% of the population consumed less than the Estimated Average Requirement of riboflavin. === Signs and symptoms === Riboflavin deficiency (also called ariboflavinosis) results in stomatitis, symptoms of which include chapped and fissured lips, inflammation of the corners of the mouth (angular stomatitis), sore throat, painful red tongue, and hair loss. The eyes can become itchy, watery, bloodshot, and sensitive to light. Riboflavin deficiency is associated with anemia. Prolonged riboflavin insufficiency may cause degeneration of the liver and nervous system. Riboflavin deficiency may increase the risk of preeclampsia in pregnant women. Deficiency of riboflavin during pregnancy can result in fetal birth defects, including heart and limb deformities. === Risk factors === People at risk of having low riboflavin levels include alcoholics, vegetarian athletes, and practitioners of veganism. Pregnant or lactating women and their infants may also be at risk, if the mother avoids meat and dairy products. Anorexia and lactose intolerance increase the risk of riboflavin deficiency. People with physically demanding lives, such as athletes and laborers, may require higher riboflavin intake. The conversion of riboflavin into FAD and FMN is impaired in people with hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, and riboflavin transporter deficiency. === Causes === Riboflavin deficiency is usually found together with other nutrient deficiencies, particularly of other water-soluble vitamins. A deficiency of riboflavin can be primary (i.e. caused by poor vitamin sources in the regular diet) or secondary, which may be a result of conditions that affect absorption in the intestine. Secondary deficiencies are typically caused by the body not being able to use the vitamin, or by an increased rate of excretion of the vitamin. Diet patterns that increase risk of deficiency include veganism and low-dairy vegetarianism. Diseases such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes may cause or exacerbate riboflavin deficiency. There are rare genetic defects that compromise riboflavin absorption, transport, metabolism or use by flavoproteins. One of these is riboflavin transporter deficiency, previously known as Brown–Vialetto–Van Laere syndrome. Variants of the genes SLC52A2 and SLC52A3 which code for transporter proteins RDVT2 and RDVT3, respectively, are defective. Infants and young children present with muscle weakness, cranial nerve deficits including hearing loss, sensory symptoms including sensory ataxia, feeding difficulties, and respiratory distress caused by a sensorimotor axonal neuropathy and cranial nerve pathology. When untreated, infants with riboflavin transporter deficiency have labored breathing and are at risk of dying in the first decade of life. Treatment with oral supplementation of high amounts of riboflavin is lifesaving. Other inborn errors of metabolism include riboflavin-responsive multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, also known as a subset of glutaric acidemia type 2, and the C677T variant of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme, which in adults has been associated with risk of high blood pressure. === Diagnosis and assessment === The assessment of riboflavin status is essential for confirming cases with non-specific symptoms whenever deficiency is suspected. Total riboflavin excretion in healthy adults with normal riboflavin intake is about 120 micrograms per day, while excretion of less than 40 micrograms per day indicates deficiency. Riboflavin excretion rates decrease as a person ages, but increase during periods of chronic stress and the use of some prescription drugs. Indicators used in humans are erythrocyte glutathione reductase (EGR), erythrocyte flavin concentration and urinary excretion. The erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity coefficient (EGRAC) provides a measure of tissue saturation and long-term riboflavin status. Results are expressed as an activity coefficient ratio, determined by enzyme activity with and without the addition of FAD to the culture medium. An EGRAC of 1.0 to 1.2 indicates that adequate amounts of riboflavin are present; 1.2 to 1.4 is considered low, greater than 1.4 indicates deficient. For the less sensitive ""erythrocyte flavin method"", values greater than 400 nmol/L are considered adequate and values below 270 nmol/L are considered deficient. Urinary excretion is expressed as nmol of riboflavin per gram of creatinine. Low is defined as in the range of 50 to 72 nmol/g. Deficient is below 50 nmol/g. Urinary excretion load tests have been used to determine dietary requirements. For adult men, as oral doses were increased from 0.5 mg to 1.1 mg, there was a modest linear increase in urinary riboflavin, reaching 100 micrograms for a subsequent 24-hour urine collection. Beyond a load dose of 1.1 mg, urinary excretion increased rapidly, so that with a dose of 2.5 mg, urinary output was 800 micrograms for a 24-hour urine collection. == History == The name ""riboflavin"" comes from ""ribose"" (the sugar whose reduced form, ribitol, forms part of its structure) and ""flavin"", the ring-moiety that imparts the yellow color to the oxidized molecule (from Latin flavus, ""yellow""). The reduced form, which occurs in metabolism along with the oxidized form, appears as orange-yellow needles or crystals. The earliest reported identification, predating any concept of vitamins as essential nutrients, was by Alexander Wynter Blyth. In 1879, Blyth isolated a water-soluble component of cows' milk whey, which he named ""lactochrome"", that fluoresced yellow-green when exposed to light. In the early 1900s, several research laboratories were investigating constituents of foods, essential to maintain growth in rats. These constituents were initially divided into fat-soluble ""vitamine"" A and water-soluble ""vitamine"" B. (The ""e"" was dropped in 1920.) Vitamin B was further thought to have two components, a heat-labile substance called B1 and a heat-stable substance called B2. Vitamin B2 was tentatively identified to be the factor necessary for preventing pellagra, but that was later confirmed to be due to niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency. The confusion was due to the fact that riboflavin (B2) deficiency causes stomatitis symptoms similar to those seen in pellagra, but without the widespread peripheral skin lesions. For this reason, early in the history of identifying riboflavin deficiency in humans the condition was sometimes called ""pellagra sine pellagra"" (pellagra without pellagra). In 1935, Paul Gyorgy, in collaboration with chemist Richard Kuhn and physician T. Wagner-Jauregg, reported that rats kept on a B2-free diet were unable to gain weight. Isolation of B2 from yeast revealed the presence of a bright yellow-green fluorescent product that restored normal growth when fed to rats. The growth restored was directly proportional to the intensity of the fluorescence. This observation enabled the researchers to develop a rapid chemical bioassay in 1933, and then isolate the factor from egg white, calling it ovoflavin. The same group then isolated the a similar preparation from whey and called it lactoflavin. In 1934, Kuhn's group identified the chemical structure of these flavins as identical, settled on ""riboflavin"" as a name, and were also able to synthesize the vitamin. Circa 1937, riboflavin was also referred to as ""Vitamin G"". In 1938, Richard Kuhn was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on vitamins, which had included B2 and B6. In 1939, it was confirmed that riboflavin is essential for human health through a clinical trial conducted by William H. Sebrell and Roy E. Butler. Women fed a diet low in riboflavin developed stomatitis and other signs of deficiency, which were reversed when treated with synthetic riboflavin. The symptoms returned when the supplements were stopped. == References =="	Riboflavin	WIKIPEDIA	('MEDICAL, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.259554922580719), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.6331167817115784), (',', -0.061988864094018936), (' INDUSTR', -0.5786611437797546), ('IAL', 0.0)])
69742.0	('Biliverdin', 'Biliverdine', 'Biliverdine ix alpha', 'Biliverdin ix alpha', 'Uteroverdine')	mouse	Biliverdin (from the Latin for green bile) is a green tetrapyrrolic bile pigment, and is a product of heme catabolism. It is the pigment responsible for a greenish color sometimes seen in bruises. == Metabolism == Biliverdin results from the breakdown of the heme moiety of hemoglobin in erythrocytes. Macrophages break down senescent erythrocytes and break the heme down into biliverdin along with hemosiderin, in which biliverdin normally rapidly reduces to free bilirubin. Biliverdin is seen briefly in some bruises as a green color. In bruises, its breakdown into bilirubin leads to a yellowish color. == Role in disease == Biliverdin has been found in excess in the blood of humans suffering from hepatic diseases. Jaundice is caused by the accumulation of biliverdin or bilirubin (or both) in the circulatory system and tissues. Jaundiced skin and sclera (whites of the eyes) are characteristic of liver failure. == Role in treatment of disease == While typically regarded as a mere waste product of heme breakdown, evidence that suggests that biliverdin – and other bile pigments – has a physiological role in humans has been mounting. Bile pigments such as biliverdin possess significant anti-mutagenic and antioxidant properties and therefore, may fulfil a useful physiological function. Biliverdin and bilirubin have been shown to be potent scavengers of hydroperoxyl radicals. They have also been shown to inhibit the effects of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, heterocyclic amines, and oxidants – all of which are mutagens. Some studies have found that people with higher concentration levels of bilirubin and biliverdin in their bodies have a lower frequency of cancer and cardiovascular disease. It has been suggested that biliverdin – as well as many other tetrapyrrolic pigments – may function as an HIV-1 protease inhibitor as well as having beneficial effects in asthma though further research is needed to confirm these results. There are currently no practical implications for using biliverdin in the treatment of any disease. == In non-human animals == Biliverdin is an important pigment component in avian egg shells, especially blue and green shells. Blue egg shells have a significantly higher concentration of biliverdin than brown egg shells. Research has shown that the biliverdin of egg shells is produced from the shell gland, rather than from the breakdown of erythrocytes in the blood stream, although there is no evidence that the sources of the material are neither tetrapyrroles nor free haem from the blood plasma. Along with its presence in avian egg shells, other studies have also shown that biliverdin is present in the blue-green blood of many marine fish, the blood of tobacco hornworm, the wings of moth and butterfly, the serum and eggs of frogs, and the placenta of dogs. With dogs this can lead, in extremely rare cases, to the birth of puppies with green fur; however, the green color fades out soon after birth. In the garfish (Belone belone) and related species, the bones are bright green because of biliverdin. The green coloration of many grasshoppers and lepidopteran larvae is also due to biliverdin. Biliverdin is also present in the green blood, muscles, bones, and mucosal lining of skinks of the genus Prasinohaema, found in New Guinea. It is uncertain whether this presence of biliverdin is an ecological or physiological adaptation of any kind. It has been suggested that accumulation of biliverdin might deter harmful infection by Plasmodium malaria parasites, although no statistically significant correlation has been established. The Cambodian frog, Chiromantis samkosensis, also exhibits this characteristic along with turquoise bones. == In fluorescence imaging == In a complex with reengineered bacterial phytochrome, biliverdin has been employed as an IR-emitting chromophore for in vivo imaging. In contrast to fluorescent proteins which form their chromophore through posttranslational modifications of the polypeptide chain, phytochromes bind an external ligand (in this case, biliverdin), and successful imaging of the first bacteriophytochrome-based probe required addition of the exogenous biliverdin. Recent studies demonstrated that bacteriophytochrome-based fluorescent proteins with high affinity to biliverdin can be imaged in vivo utilizing endogenous ligand only and, thus, with the same ease as the conventional fluorescent proteins. Advent of the second and further generations of the biliverdin-binding bacteriophytochrome-based probes should broaden the possibilities for the non-invasive in vivo imaging. A new class of fluorescent protein was evolved from a cyanobacterial (Trichodesmium erythraeum) phycobiliprotein, α-allophycocyanin, and named small ultra red fluorescent protein (smURFP) in 2016. smURFP autocatalytically self-incorporates the chromophore biliverdin without the need of an external protein, known as a lyase. Jellyfish- and coral-derived fluorescent proteins require oxygen and produce a stoichiometric amount of hydrogen peroxide upon chromophore formation. smURFP does not require oxygen or produce hydrogen peroxide and uses the chromophore biliverdin. smURFP has a large extinction coefficient (180,000 M−1 cm−1) and has a modest quantum yield (0.20), which makes it comparable biophysical brightness to eGFP and about 2-fold brighter than most red or far-red fluorescent proteins derived from coral. smURFP spectral properties are similar to the organic dye Cy5. == See also == Bilirubin Heme Stercobilin Tetrapyrrole Urobilin == References == == External links == Explaining jaundice in newborn at NHS	Biliverdin	WIKIPEDIA	('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -6.153795766294934e-06), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.0004315036640036851), ('US', 0.0)])

Cholesterol is biosynthesized by all animal cells and is an essential structural and signaling component of animal cell membranes. In vertebrates, hepatic cells typically produce the greatest amounts. In the brain, astrocytes produce cholesterol and transport it to neurons. It is absent among prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea), although there are some exceptions, such as Mycoplasma, which require cholesterol for growth. Cholesterol also serves as a precursor for the biosynthesis of steroid hormones, bile acid and vitamin D. Elevated levels of cholesterol in the blood, especially when bound to low-density lipoprotein (LDL, often referred to as ""bad cholesterol""), may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. François Poulletier de la Salle first identified cholesterol in solid form in gallstones in 1769. In 1815, chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul named the compound ""cholesterine"". == Etymology == The word cholesterol comes from Ancient Greek chole- 'bile' and stereos 'solid', followed by the chemical suffix -ol for an alcohol. == Physiology == Cholesterol is essential for all animal life. While most cells are capable of synthesizing it, the majority of cholesterol is ingested or synthesized by hepatocytes and transported in the blood to peripheral cells. The levels of cholesterol in peripheral tissues are dictated by a balance of uptake and export. Under normal conditions, brain cholesterol is separate from peripheral cholesterol, i.e., the dietary and hepatic cholesterol do not cross the blood brain barrier. Rather, astrocytes produce and distribute cholesterol in the brain. De novo synthesis, both in astrocytes and hepatocytes, occurs by a complex 37-step process. This begins with the mevalonate or HMG-CoA reductase pathway, the target of statin drugs, which encompasses the first 18 steps. This is followed by 19 additional steps to convert the resulting lanosterol into cholesterol. A human male weighing 68 kg (150 lb) normally synthesizes about 1 gram (1,000 mg) of cholesterol per day, and his body contains about 35 g, mostly contained within the cell membranes. Typical daily cholesterol dietary intake for a man in the United States is 307 mg. Most ingested cholesterol is esterified, which causes it to be poorly absorbed by the gut. The body also compensates for absorption of ingested cholesterol by reducing its own cholesterol synthesis. For these reasons, cholesterol in food, seven to ten hours after ingestion, has little, if any effect on concentrations of cholesterol in the blood. Surprisingly, in rats, blood cholesterol is inversely correlated with cholesterol consumption. The more cholesterol a rat eats the lower the blood cholesterol. During the first seven hours after ingestion of cholesterol, as absorbed fats are being distributed around the body within extracellular water by the various lipoproteins (which transport all fats in the water outside cells), the concentrations increase. Plants make cholesterol in very small amounts. In larger quantities they produce phytosterols, chemically similar substances which can compete with cholesterol for reabsorption in the intestinal tract, thus potentially reducing cholesterol reabsorption. When intestinal lining cells absorb phytosterols, in place of cholesterol, they usually excrete the phytosterol molecules back into the GI tract, an important protective mechanism. The intake of naturally occurring phytosterols, which encompass plant sterols and stanols, ranges between ≈200–300 mg/day depending on eating habits. Specially designed vegetarian experimental diets have been produced yielding upwards of 700 mg/day. === Function === ==== Membranes ==== Cholesterol is present in varying degrees in all animal cell membranes, but is absent in prokaryotes. It is required to build and maintain membranes and modulates membrane fluidity over the range of physiological temperatures. The hydroxyl group of each cholesterol molecule interacts with water molecules surrounding the membrane, as do the polar heads of the membrane phospholipids and sphingolipids, while the bulky steroid and the hydrocarbon chain are embedded in the membrane, alongside the nonpolar fatty-acid chain of the other lipids. Through the interaction with the phospholipid fatty-acid chains, cholesterol increases membrane packing, which both alters membrane fluidity and maintains membrane integrity so that animal cells do not need to build cell walls (like plants and most bacteria). The membrane remains stable and durable without being rigid, allowing animal cells to change shape and animals to move. The structure of the tetracyclic ring of cholesterol contributes to the fluidity of the cell membrane, as the molecule is in a trans conformation making all but the side chain of cholesterol rigid and planar. In this structural role, cholesterol also reduces the permeability of the plasma membrane to neutral solutes, hydrogen ions, and sodium ions. ==== Substrate presentation ==== Cholesterol regulates the biological process of substrate presentation and the enzymes that use substrate presentation as a mechanism of their activation. Phospholipase D2 (PLD2) is a well-defined example of an enzyme activated by substrate presentation. The enzyme is palmitoylated causing the enzyme to traffic to cholesterol dependent lipid domains sometimes called ""lipid rafts"". The substrate of phospholipase D is phosphatidylcholine (PC) which is unsaturated and is of low abundance in lipid rafts. PC localizes to the disordered region of the cell along with the polyunsaturated lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). PLD2 has a PIP2 binding domain. When PIP2 concentration in the membrane increases, PLD2 leaves the cholesterol-dependent domains and binds to PIP2 where it then gains access to its substrate PC and commences catalysis based on substrate presentation. ==== Signaling ==== Cholesterol is also implicated in cell signaling processes, assisting in the formation of lipid rafts in the plasma membrane, which brings receptor proteins in close proximity with high concentrations of second messenger molecules. In multiple layers, cholesterol and phospholipids, both electrical insulators, can facilitate speed of transmission of electrical impulses along nerve tissue. For many neuron fibers, a myelin sheath, rich in cholesterol since it is derived from compacted layers of Schwann cell or oligodendrocyte membranes, provides insulation for more efficient conduction of impulses. Demyelination (loss of myelin) is believed to be part of the basis for multiple sclerosis. Cholesterol binds to and affects the gating of a number of ion channels such as the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, GABAA receptor, and the inward-rectifier potassium channel. Cholesterol also activates the estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRα), and may be the endogenous ligand for the receptor. The constitutively active nature of the receptor may be explained by the fact that cholesterol is ubiquitous in the body. Inhibition of ERRα signaling by reduction of cholesterol production has been identified as a key mediator of the effects of statins and bisphosphonates on bone, muscle, and macrophages. On the basis of these findings, it has been suggested that the ERRα should be de-orphanized and classified as a receptor for cholesterol. ==== As a chemical precursor ==== Within cells, cholesterol is also a precursor molecule for several biochemical pathways. For example, it is the precursor molecule for the synthesis of vitamin D in the calcium metabolism and all steroid hormones, including the adrenal gland hormones cortisol and aldosterone, as well as the sex hormones progesterone, estrogens, and testosterone, and their derivatives. ==== Epidermis ==== The stratum corneum is the outermost layer of the epidermis. It is composed of terminally differentiated and enucleated corneocytes that reside within a lipid matrix, like ""bricks and mortar."" Together with ceramides and free fatty acids, cholesterol forms the lipid mortar, a water-impermeable barrier that prevents evaporative water loss. As a rule of thumb, the epidermal lipid matrix is composed of an equimolar mixture of ceramides (≈50% by weight), cholesterol (≈25% by weight), and free fatty acids (≈15% by weight), with smaller quantities of other lipids also being present. Cholesterol sulfate reaches its highest concentration in the granular layer of the epidermis. Steroid sulfate sulfatase then decreases its concentration in the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the epidermis. The relative abundance of cholesterol sulfate in the epidermis varies across different body sites with the heel of the foot having the lowest concentration. === Metabolism === Cholesterol is recycled in the body. The liver excretes cholesterol into biliary fluids, which are then stored in the gallbladder, which then excretes them in a non-esterified form (via bile) into the digestive tract. Typically, about 50% of the excreted cholesterol is reabsorbed by the small intestine back into the bloodstream. == Biosynthesis and regulation == === Biosynthesis === Almost all animal tissues synthesize cholesterol from acetyl-CoA. All animal cells (exceptions exist within the invertebrates) manufacture cholesterol, for both membrane structure and other uses, with relative production rates varying by cell type and organ function. About 80% of total daily cholesterol production occurs in the liver and the intestines; other sites of higher synthesis rates include the brain, the adrenal glands, and the reproductive organs. Synthesis within the body starts with the mevalonate pathway where two molecules of acetyl CoA condense to form acetoacetyl-CoA. This is followed by a second condensation between acetyl CoA and acetoacetyl-CoA to form 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA). This molecule is then reduced to mevalonate by the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. Production of mevalonate is the rate-limiting and irreversible step in cholesterol synthesis and is the site of action for statins (a class of cholesterol-lowering drugs). Mevalonate is finally converted to isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) through two phosphorylation steps and one decarboxylation step that requires ATP. Three molecules of isopentenyl pyrophosphate condense to form farnesyl pyrophosphate through the action of geranyl transferase. Two molecules of farnesyl pyrophosphate then condense to form squalene by the action of squalene synthase in the endoplasmic reticulum. Oxidosqualene cyclase then cyclizes squalene to form lanosterol. Finally, lanosterol is converted to cholesterol via either of two pathways, the Bloch pathway, or the Kandutsch-Russell pathway. The final 19 steps to cholesterol contain NADPH and oxygen to help oxidize methyl groups for removal of carbons, mutases to move alkene groups, and NADH to help reduce ketones. Konrad Bloch and Feodor Lynen shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1964 for their discoveries concerning some of the mechanisms and methods of regulation of cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism. === Regulation of cholesterol synthesis === Biosynthesis of cholesterol is directly regulated by the cholesterol levels present, though the homeostatic mechanisms involved are only partly understood. A higher intake of food leads to a net decrease in endogenous production, whereas a lower intake of food has the opposite effect. The main regulatory mechanism is the sensing of intracellular cholesterol in the endoplasmic reticulum by the protein SREBP (sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 and 2). In the presence of cholesterol, SREBP is bound to two other proteins: SCAP (SREBP cleavage-activating protein) and INSIG-1. When cholesterol levels fall, INSIG-1 dissociates from the SREBP-SCAP complex, which allows the complex to migrate to the Golgi apparatus. Here SREBP is cleaved by S1P and S2P (site-1 protease and site-2 protease), two enzymes that are activated by SCAP when cholesterol levels are low. The cleaved SREBP then migrates to the nucleus and acts as a transcription factor to bind to the sterol regulatory element (SRE), which stimulates the transcription of many genes. Among these are the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor and HMG-CoA reductase. The LDL receptor scavenges circulating LDL from the bloodstream, whereas HMG-CoA reductase leads to an increase in endogenous production of cholesterol. A large part of this signaling pathway was clarified by Dr. Michael S. Brown and Dr. Joseph L. Goldstein in the 1970s. In 1985, they received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work. Their subsequent work shows how the SREBP pathway regulates the expression of many genes that control lipid formation and metabolism and body fuel allocation. Cholesterol synthesis can also be turned off when cholesterol levels are high. HMG-CoA reductase contains both a cytosolic domain (responsible for its catalytic function) and a membrane domain. The membrane domain senses signals for its degradation. Increasing concentrations of cholesterol (and other sterols) cause a change in this domain's oligomerization state, which makes it more susceptible to destruction by the proteasome. This enzyme's activity can also be reduced by phosphorylation by an AMP-activated protein kinase. Because this kinase is activated by AMP, which is produced when ATP is hydrolyzed, it follows that cholesterol synthesis is halted when ATP levels are low. === Plasma transport and regulation of absorption === As an isolated molecule, cholesterol is only minimally soluble in water, or hydrophilic. Because of this, it dissolves in blood at exceedingly small concentrations. To be transported effectively, cholesterol is instead packaged within lipoproteins, complex discoidal particles with exterior amphiphilic proteins and lipids, whose outward-facing surfaces are water-soluble and inward-facing surfaces are lipid-soluble. This allows it to travel through the blood via emulsification. Unbound cholesterol, being amphipathic, is transported in the monolayer surface of the lipoprotein particle along with phospholipids and proteins. Cholesterol esters bound to fatty acid, on the other hand, are transported within the fatty hydrophobic core of the lipoprotein, along with triglyceride. There are several types of lipoproteins in the blood. In order of increasing density, they are chylomicrons, very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Lower protein/lipid ratios make for less dense lipoproteins. Cholesterol within different lipoproteins is identical, although some are carried as their native ""free"" alcohol form (the cholesterol-OH group facing the water surrounding the particles), while others as fatty acyl esters, known also as cholesterol esters, within the particles. Lipoprotein particles are organized by complex apolipoproteins, typically 80–100 different proteins per particle, which can be recognized and bound by specific receptors on cell membranes, directing their lipid payload into specific cells and tissues currently ingesting these fat transport particles. These surface receptors serve as unique molecular signatures, which then help determine fat distribution delivery throughout the body. Chylomicrons, the least dense cholesterol transport particles, contain apolipoprotein B-48, apolipoprotein C, and apolipoprotein E (the principal cholesterol carrier in the brain) in their shells. Chylomicrons carry fats from the intestine to muscle and other tissues in need of fatty acids for energy or fat production. Unused cholesterol remains in more cholesterol-rich chylomicron remnants and is taken up from here to the bloodstream by the liver. VLDL particles are produced by the liver from triacylglycerol and cholesterol which was not used in the synthesis of bile acids. These particles contain apolipoprotein B100 and apolipoprotein E in their shells and can be degraded by lipoprotein lipase on the artery wall to IDL. This arterial wall cleavage allows absorption of triacylglycerol and increases the concentration of circulating cholesterol. IDL particles are then consumed in two processes: half is metabolized by HTGL and taken up by the LDL receptor on the liver cell surfaces, while the other half continues to lose triacylglycerols in the bloodstream until they become cholesterol-laden LDL particles. LDL particles are the major blood cholesterol carriers. Each one contains approximately 1,500 molecules of cholesterol ester. LDL particle shells contain just one molecule of apolipoprotein B100, recognized by LDL receptors in peripheral tissues. Upon binding of apolipoprotein B100, many LDL receptors concentrate in clathrin-coated pits. Both LDL and its receptor form vesicles within a cell via endocytosis. These vesicles then fuse with a lysosome, where the lysosomal acid lipase enzyme hydrolyzes the cholesterol esters. The cholesterol can then be used for membrane biosynthesis or esterified and stored within the cell, so as to not interfere with the cell membranes. LDL receptors are used up during cholesterol absorption, and its synthesis is regulated by SREBP, the same protein that controls the synthesis of cholesterol de novo, according to its presence inside the cell. A cell with abundant cholesterol will have its LDL receptor synthesis blocked, to prevent new cholesterol in LDL particles from being taken up. Conversely, LDL receptor synthesis proceeds when a cell is deficient in cholesterol. When this process becomes unregulated, LDL particles without receptors begin to appear in the blood. These LDL particles are oxidized and taken up by macrophages, which become engorged and form foam cells. These foam cells often become trapped in the walls of blood vessels and contribute to atherosclerotic plaque formation. Differences in cholesterol homeostasis affect the development of early atherosclerosis (carotid intima-media thickness). These plaques are the main causes of heart attacks, strokes, and other serious medical problems, leading to the association of so-called LDL cholesterol (actually a lipoprotein) with ""bad"" cholesterol. HDL particles are thought to transport cholesterol back to the liver, either for excretion or for other tissues that synthesize hormones, in a process known as reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). Large numbers of HDL particles correlates with better health outcomes, whereas low numbers of HDL particles is associated with atheromatous disease progression in the arteries. === Metabolism, recycling and excretion === Cholesterol is susceptible to oxidation and easily forms oxygenated derivatives called oxysterols. Three different mechanisms can form these: autoxidation, secondary oxidation to lipid peroxidation, and cholesterol-metabolizing enzyme oxidation. A great interest in oxysterols arose when they were shown to exert inhibitory actions on cholesterol biosynthesis. This finding became known as the ""oxysterol hypothesis"". Additional roles for oxysterols in human physiology include their participation in bile acid biosynthesis, function as transport forms of cholesterol, and regulation of gene transcription. In biochemical experiments, radiolabelled forms of cholesterol, such as tritiated-cholesterol, are used. These derivatives undergo degradation upon storage, and it is essential to purify cholesterol prior to use. Cholesterol can be purified using small Sephadex LH-20 columns. Cholesterol is oxidized by the liver into a variety of bile acids. These, in turn, are conjugated with glycine, taurine, glucuronic acid, or sulfate. A mixture of conjugated and nonconjugated bile acids, along with cholesterol itself, is excreted from the liver into the bile. Approximately 95% of the bile acids are reabsorbed from the intestines, and the remainder are lost in the feces. The excretion and reabsorption of bile acids forms the basis of the enterohepatic circulation, which is essential for the digestion and absorption of dietary fats. Under certain circumstances, when more concentrated, as in the gallbladder, cholesterol crystallises and is the major constituent of most gallstones (lecithin and bilirubin gallstones also occur, but less frequently). Every day, up to 1 g of cholesterol enters the colon. This cholesterol originates from the diet, bile, and desquamated intestinal cells, and it can be metabolized by the colonic bacteria. Cholesterol is converted mainly into coprostanol, a nonabsorbable sterol that is excreted in the feces. Although cholesterol is a steroid generally associated with mammals, the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis is able to completely degrade this molecule and contains a large number of genes that are regulated by its presence. Many of these cholesterol-regulated genes are homologues of fatty acid β-oxidation genes, but have evolved in such a way as to bind large steroid substrates like cholesterol. == Dietary sources == Animal fats are complex mixtures of triglycerides, with lesser amounts of both the phospholipids and cholesterol molecules from which all animal (and human) cell membranes are constructed. Since all animal cells manufacture cholesterol, all animal-based foods contain cholesterol in varying amounts. Major dietary sources of cholesterol include red meat, egg yolks and whole eggs, liver, kidney, giblets, fish oil, shellfish, and butter. Human breast milk also contains significant quantities of cholesterol. Plant cells synthesize cholesterol as a precursor for other compounds, such as phytosterols and steroidal glycoalkaloids, with cholesterol remaining in plant foods only in minor amounts or absent. Some plant foods, such as avocado, flax seeds and peanuts, contain phytosterols, which compete with cholesterol for absorption in the intestines and reduce the absorption of both dietary and bile cholesterol. A typical diet contributes on the order of 0.2 gram of phytosterols, which is not enough to have a significant impact on blocking cholesterol absorption. Phytosterols intake can be supplemented through the use of phytosterol-containing functional foods or dietary supplements that are recognized as having potential to reduce levels of LDL-cholesterol. === Medical guidelines and recommendations === In 2015, the scientific advisory panel of U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture for the 2015 iteration of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans dropped the previously recommended limit of consumption of dietary cholesterol to 300 mg per day with a new recommendation to ""eat as little dietary cholesterol as possible"", thereby acknowledging an association between a diet low in cholesterol and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease. A 2013 report by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology recommended focusing on healthy dietary patterns rather than specific cholesterol limits, as they are hard for clinicians and consumers to implement. They recommend the DASH and Mediterranean diet, which are low in cholesterol. A 2017 review by the American Heart Association recommends switching saturated fats for polyunsaturated fats to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Some supplemental guidelines have recommended doses of phytosterols in the 1.6–3.0 grams per day range (Health Canada, EFSA, ATP III, FDA). A meta-analysis demonstrated a 12% reduction in LDL-cholesterol at a mean dose of 2.1 grams per day. The benefits of a diet supplemented with phytosterols have also been questioned. == Clinical significance == === Hypercholesterolemia === According to the lipid hypothesis, elevated levels of cholesterol in the blood lead to atherosclerosis which may increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and peripheral artery disease. Since higher blood LDL – especially higher LDL concentrations and smaller LDL particle size – contributes to this process more than the cholesterol content of the HDL particles, LDL particles are often termed ""bad cholesterol"". High concentrations of functional HDL, which can remove cholesterol from cells and atheromas, offer protection and are commonly referred to as ""good cholesterol"". These balances are mostly genetically determined, but can be changed by body composition, medications, diet, and other factors. A 2007 study demonstrated that blood total cholesterol levels have an exponential effect on cardiovascular and total mortality, with the association more pronounced in younger subjects. Because cardiovascular disease is relatively rare in the younger population, the impact of high cholesterol on health is larger in older people. Elevated levels of the lipoprotein fractions, LDL, IDL and VLDL, rather than the total cholesterol level, correlate with the extent and progress of atherosclerosis. Conversely, the total cholesterol can be within normal limits, yet be made up primarily of small LDL and small HDL particles, under which conditions atheroma growth rates are high. A post hoc analysis of the IDEAL and the EPIC prospective studies found an association between high levels of HDL cholesterol (adjusted for apolipoprotein A-I and apolipoprotein B) and increased risk of cardiovascular disease, casting doubt on the cardioprotective role of ""good cholesterol"". About one in 250 individuals can have a genetic mutation for the LDL cholesterol receptor that causes them to have familial hypercholesterolemia. Inherited high cholesterol can also include genetic mutations in the PCSK9 gene and the gene for apolipoprotein B. Elevated cholesterol levels are treatable by a diet that reduces or eliminates saturated fat, and trans fats, often followed by one of various hypolipidemic agents, such as statins, fibrates, cholesterol absorption inhibitors, monoclonal antibody therapy (PCSK9 inhibitors), nicotinic acid derivatives or bile acid sequestrants. There are several international guidelines on the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. Human trials using HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, known as statins, have repeatedly confirmed that changing lipoprotein transport patterns from unhealthy to healthier patterns significantly lowers cardiovascular disease event rates, even for people with cholesterol values currently considered low for adults. Studies have shown that reducing LDL cholesterol levels by about 38.7 mg/dL with the use of statins can reduce cardiovascular disease and stroke risk by about 21%. Studies have also found that statins reduce atheroma progression. As a result, people with a history of cardiovascular disease may derive benefit from statins irrespective of their cholesterol levels (total cholesterol below 5.0 mmol/L [193 mg/dL]), and in men without cardiovascular disease, there is benefit from lowering abnormally high cholesterol levels (""primary prevention""). Primary prevention in women was originally practiced only by extension of the findings in studies on men, since, in women, none of the large statin trials conducted prior to 2007 demonstrated a significant reduction in overall mortality or in cardiovascular endpoints. Meta-analyses have demonstrated significant reductions in all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, without significant heterogeneity by sex. The 1987 report of National Cholesterol Education Program, Adult Treatment Panels suggests the total blood cholesterol level should be: < 200 mg/dL normal blood cholesterol, 200–239 mg/dL borderline-high, > 240 mg/dL high cholesterol. The American Heart Association provides a similar set of guidelines for total (fasting) blood cholesterol levels and risk for heart disease: Statins are effective in lowering LDL cholesterol and widely used for primary prevention in people at high risk of cardiovascular disease, as well as in secondary prevention for those who have developed cardiovascular disease. The average global mean total Cholesterol for humans has remained at about 4.6 mmol/L (178 mg/dL) for men and women, both crude and age standardized, for nearly 40 years from 1980 to 2018, with some regional variations and reduction of total Cholesterol in Western nations. More current testing methods determine LDL (""bad"") and HDL (""good"") cholesterol separately, allowing cholesterol analysis to be more nuanced. The desirable LDL level is considered to be less than 100 mg/dL (2.6 mmol/L). Total cholesterol is defined as the sum of HDL, LDL, and VLDL. Usually, only the total, HDL, and triglycerides are measured. For cost reasons, the VLDL is usually estimated as one-fifth of the triglycerides and the LDL is estimated using the Friedewald formula (or a variant): estimated LDL = [total cholesterol] − [total HDL] − [estimated VLDL]. Direct LDL measures are used when triglycerides exceed 400 mg/dL. The estimated VLDL and LDL have more error when triglycerides are above 400 mg/dL. In the Framingham Heart Study, each 10 mg/dL (0.6 mmol/L) increase in total cholesterol levels increased 30-year overall mortality by 5% and CVD mortality by 9%. While subjects over the age of 50 had an 11% increase in overall mortality, and a 14% increase in cardiovascular disease mortality per 1 mg/dL (0.06 mmol/L) year drop in total cholesterol levels. The researchers attributed this phenomenon to a different correlation, whereby the disease itself increases risk of death, as well as changes a myriad of factors, such as weight loss and the inability to eat, which lower serum cholesterol. This effect was also shown in men of all ages and women over 50 in the Vorarlberg Health Monitoring and Promotion Programme. These groups were more likely to die of cancer, liver diseases, and mental diseases with very low total cholesterol, of 186 mg/dL (10.3 mmol/L) and lower. This result indicates the low-cholesterol effect occurs even among younger respondents, contradicting the previous assessment among cohorts of older people that this is a marker for frailty occurring with age. === Hypocholesterolemia === Abnormally low levels of cholesterol are termed hypocholesterolemia. Research into the causes of this state is relatively limited, but some studies suggest a link with depression, cancer, and cerebral hemorrhage. In general, the low cholesterol levels seem to be a consequence, rather than a cause, of an underlying illness. A genetic defect in cholesterol synthesis causes Smith–Lemli–Opitz syndrome, which is often associated with low plasma cholesterol levels. Hyperthyroidism, or any other endocrine disturbance which causes upregulation of the LDL receptor, may result in hypocholesterolemia. === Testing === The American Heart Association recommends testing cholesterol every 4–6 years for people aged 20 years or older. A separate set of American Heart Association guidelines issued in 2013 indicates that people taking statin medications should have their cholesterol tested 4–12 weeks after their first dose and then every 3–12 months thereafter. For men ages 45 to 65 and women ages 55 to 65, a cholesterol test should occur every 1–2 years, and for seniors over age 65, an annual test should be performed. A blood sample after 12-hours of fasting is taken by a healthcare professional from an arm vein to measure a lipid profile for a) total cholesterol, b) HDL cholesterol, c) LDL cholesterol, and d) triglycerides. Results may be expressed as ""calculated"", indicating a calculation of total cholesterol, HDL, and triglycerides. Cholesterol is tested to determine for ""normal"" or ""desirable"" levels if a person has a total cholesterol of 5.2 mmol/L or less (200 mg/dL), an HDL value of more than 1 mmol/L (40 mg/dL, ""the higher, the better""), an LDL value of less than 2.6 mmol/L (100 mg/dL), and a triglycerides level of less than 1.7 mmol/L (150 mg/dL). Blood cholesterol in people with lifestyle, aging, or cardiovascular risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, family history of coronary artery disease, or angina, are evaluated at different levels. == Interactive pathway map == Click on genes, proteins and metabolites below to link to respective articles. == Cholesteric liquid crystals == Some cholesterol derivatives (among other simple cholesteric lipids) are known to generate the cholesteric liquid crystalline phase. The cholesteric phase is, in fact, a chiral nematic phase, and it changes colour when its temperature changes. This makes cholesterol derivatives useful for indicating temperature in liquid-crystal display thermometers and in temperature-sensitive paints. == Stereoisomers == Cholesterol has 256 stereoisomers that arise from its eight stereocenters, although only two of the stereoisomers have biochemical significance (nat-cholesterol and ent-cholesterol, for natural and enantiomer, respectively), and only one occurs naturally (nat-cholesterol). == Additional images == == See also == == References == == External links == Media related to Cholesterol at Wikimedia Commons"	Cholesterol	WIKIPEDIA	('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.0001137947037932463), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -4.246537173457909e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.38693687319755554), (' FOOD', -0.003682974725961685)])

Finally, we review important aspects of the relationship among structure, dynamics and enzymatic function of this key redox protein. The flavoprotein thioredoxin reductase catalyzes the reduction of the small redox protein thioredoxin by NADPH. Thioredoxin reductase contains a redox active disulfide and is a member of the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase family of flavoenzymes that includes lipoamide dehydrogenase, glutathione reductase, trypanothione reductase, mercuric reductase, and NADH peroxidase. The structure of thioredoxin reductase has recently been determined from X-ray crystallographic data. In this paper, we attempt to correlate the structure with a considerable body of mechanistic data and to arrive at a mechanism consistent with both. The path of reducing equivalents in catalysis by glutathione reductase and lipoamide dehydrogenase is clear. To envisage the path of reducing equivalents in catalysis by thioredoxin reductase, a conformational change is required in which the NADPH domain rotates relative to the FAD domain. The rotation moves the nascent dithiol from its observed position adjacent to the re surface of the flavin ring system toward the protein surface for dithiol-disulfide interchange with the protein substrate thioredoxin and moves the nicotinamide ring of NADPH adjacent to the flavin ring for efficient hydride transfer. Reverse rotation allows reduction of the redox active disulfide by the reduced flavin. This requires that the enzyme pass through a ternary complex; the kinetic evidence for such a complex is discussed. In this work, we have designed and generated a Fe(III)-binding protein with thiol oxidoreductase activity.

76902.0	('Lyso pc (16:1)',)	mouse	 The identification of cancer biomarkers is critical for target-linked cancer therapy. The overall level of phosphatidylcholine (PC) is elevated in colorectal cancer (CRC). To investigate which species of PC is overexpressed in colorectal cancer, an imaging mass spectrometry was performed using a panel of non-neoplastic mucosal and CRC tissues. In the present study, we identified a novel biomarker, PC(16:0/16:1), in CRC using imaging mass spectrometry. Specifically, elevated levels of PC(16:0/16:1) expression were observed in the more advanced stage of CRC. Our data further showed that PC(16:0/16:1) was specifically localized in the cancer region when examined using imaging mass spectrometry. Notably, because the ratio of PC(16:0/16:1) to lyso-PC(16:0) was higher in CRC, we postulated that lyso-PC acyltransferase (LPCAT) activity is elevated in CRC. In an in vitro analysis, we showed that LPCAT4 is involved in the deregulation of PC(16:0/16:1) in CRC. In an immunohistochemical analysis, LPCAT4 was shown to be overexpressed in CRC. These data indicate the potential usefulness of PC(16:0/16:1) for the clinical diagnosis of CRC and implicate LPCAT4 in the elevated expression of PC(16:0/16:1) in CRC.

Kynurenine is synthesized by the enzyme tryptophan dioxygenase, which is made primarily but not exclusively in the liver, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, which is made in many tissues in response to immune activation. Kynurenine and its further breakdown products carry out diverse biological functions, including dilating blood vessels during inflammation and regulating the immune response. Some cancers increase kynurenine production, which increases tumor growth. Kynurenine protects the eye by absorbing UV light, especially in the UVA region (315–400 nm). Kynurenine is present in the lens and retina as one of multiple tryptophan derivatives produced in the eye, including 3-hydroxykynurenine, that together provide UV protection and aid in enhancing visual acuity. The use of kynurenine as a UV filter is consistent with its photostability and low photosensitization, owing to its efficient relaxation from the UV-induced excited state. The concentration of this UV filter decreases with age, and this loss of free kynurenine and the concomitant formation of relatively more photosensitizing kynurenine derivatives and kynurenine-protein conjugates may contribute to the formation of cataracts. Evidence suggests that increased kynurenine production may precipitate depressive symptoms associated with interferon treatment for hepatitis C. Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are associated with imbalances in the enzymes that break down kynurenine. Blood levels of kynurenine are reduced in people with bipolar disorder. Kynurenine production is increased in Alzheimer's disease and cardiovascular disease where its metabolites are associated with cognitive deficits and depressive symptoms. Kynurenine is also associated with tics. Kynureninase catalyzes the conversion of kynurenine into anthranilic acid while kynurenine-oxoglutarate transaminase catalyzes its conversion into kynurenic acid. Kynurenine 3-hydroxylase catalyzes the conversion of kynurenine to 3-hydroxykynurenine. Kynurenine has also been identified as one of two compounds that makes up the pigment that gives the goldenrod crab spider its yellow color. == Kynurenine pathway dysfunction == Dysfunctional states of distinct steps of the kynurenine pathway (such as kynurenine, kynurenic acid, quinolinic acid, anthranilic acid, 3-hydroxykynurenine) have been described for a number of disorders, including: HIV dementia Tourette syndrome Tic disorders Psychiatric disorders (such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depression, anxiety disorders) Multiple sclerosis Huntington's disease Encephalopathies Lipid metabolism Liver fat metabolism Systemic lupus erythematosus Glutaric aciduria Vitamin B6 deficiency Eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome Downregulation of kynurenine-3-monooxygenase (KMO) can be caused by genetic polymorphisms, cytokines, or both. KMO deficiency leads to an accumulation of kynurenine and to a shift within the tryptophan metabolic pathway towards kynurenine acid and anthranilic acid. Kynurenine-3-monooxygenase deficiency is associated with disorders of the brain (e.g. major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, tic disorders) and of the liver. == Drug development == It is hypothesized that the kynurenine pathway is partly responsible for the therapeutic effect of lithium on bipolar disorder.

63842.0	('Pyroglutamic acid', 'Pidolic acid', 'H-pyr-oh', '(s)-5-oxopyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid', '(2s)-5-oxopyrrolidine-2-carboxylic acid')	mouse	Pyroglutamic acid (also known as PCA, 5-oxoproline, pidolic acid) is a ubiquitous but understudied natural amino acid derivative in which the free amino group of glutamic acid or glutamine cyclizes to form a lactam. The names of pyroglutamic acid conjugate base, anion, salts, and esters are pyroglutamate, 5-oxoprolinate, or pidolate. It is a metabolite in the glutathione cycle that is converted to glutamate by 5-oxoprolinase. Pyroglutamate is found in many proteins including bacteriorhodopsin. N-terminal glutamic acid and glutamine residues can spontaneously cyclize to become pyroglutamate, or enzymatically converted by glutaminyl cyclases. This is one of several forms of blocked N-termini which present a problem for N-terminal sequencing using Edman chemistry, which requires a free primary amino group not present in pyroglutamic acid. The enzyme pyroglutamate aminopeptidase can restore a free N-terminus by cleaving off the pyroglutamate residue. Pyroglutamic acid exists as two distinct enantiomers: (2R) or D which happens to be (+) or d (2S) or L which happens to be (–) or l == Metabolism == As first discovered in 1882, pyroglutamic acid can be formed by heating glutamic acid at 180 °C, which results in the loss of a molecule of water. In living cells, it is derived from glutathione through the action of an enzyme, γ-glutamyl cyclotransferase. Pyroglutamic acid may function in glutamate storage, and acts to oppose the action of glutamate, including in the brain. It also acts on the brain's cholinergic system; Amyloid β containing pyroglutamic acid is increased in Alzheimer's disease; this may be part of the disease process. Increased levels of pyroglutamic acid in the blood, leading to excess in the urine (5-oxoprolinuria), can occur following paracetamol overdose, as well as in certain inborn errors of metabolism, causing high anion gap metabolic acidosis. == Uses == The sodium salt of pyroglutamic acid—known either as sodium pyroglutamate, sodium PCA, or sodium pidolate—is used for dry skin and hair products, as it is a humectant. It has low toxicity and is not a skin irritant, but its use in products is limited by a high price. L-pyroglutamic acid is sold online as a nootropic dietary supplement. Magnesium pidolate, the magnesium salt of pyroglutamic acid, is found in some mineral supplements. In a preclinical study, additional pharmacological properties of pyroglutamic acid were revealed such as anti-phosphodiesterase type 5, anti-angiotensin-converting enzyme, and anti-urease activities. == References ==	Pyroglutamic acid	WIKIPEDIA	('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.0010542457457631826), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.0004883344518020749), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.5306235551834106), (',', -6.704273118884885e-07), (' PERSONAL', -0.008621077984571457), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.10025477409362793), (' MED', -0.062333330512046814), ('ICAL', 0.0)])

Humans are unable to synthesize vitamin C, so it is strictly obtained through the dietary intake of fruits and vegetables. Citrus fruits, berries, tomatoes, potatoes, and green leafy vegetables are excellent sources of vitamin C. Although most vitamin C is completely absorbed in the small intestine, the percentage of absorbed vitamin C decreases as intraluminal concentrations increase. Proline residues on procollagen require vitamin C for hydroxylation, making it necessary for the triple-helix formation of mature collagen. The lack of a stable triple-helical structure compromises the integrity of the skin, mucous membranes, blood vessels, and bone. Consequently, a deficiency in vitamin C results in scurvy, which presents with hemorrhage, hyperkeratosis, and hematological abnormalities. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of vitamin C so providers can direct patient therapy in treatment or supplementation where it is indicated as part of the interprofessional team. Vitamin B5, also known as pantothenic acid, is a water-soluble nutrient necessary for various metabolic functions within the body. This essential vitamin participates in energy generation, synthesizing hormones, and maintaining optimal conditions for skin, hair, and nails. Supplemental vitamin B5 is employed to address and mitigate nutrient deficiencies. This activity discusses the mechanisms of action, adverse event profile, off-label applications, appropriate dosing strategies, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring procedures, and relevant interactions of vitamin B5. Participants gain insights and knowledge essential for managing cases involving nutritional deficiencies and related conditions. Acne is an inflammatory disorder with a high global burden. It is common in adolescents and primarily affects sebaceous gland-rich areas. The clinical benefit of the topical acne treatments azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, sulphur, zinc, and alpha-hydroxy acid is unclear. To assess the effects of topical treatments (azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, zinc, alpha-hydroxy acid, and sulphur) for acne. We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers. Clinical randomised controlled trials of the six topical treatments compared with other topical treatments, placebo, or no treatment in people with acne. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Key outcomes included participants' global self-assessment of acne improvement (PGA), withdrawal for any reason, minor adverse events (assessed as total number of participants who experienced at least one minor adverse event), and quality of life. We included 49 trials (3880 reported participants) set in clinics, hospitals, research centres, and university settings in Europe, Asia, and the USA. The vast majority of participants had mild to moderate acne, were aged between 12 to 30 years (range: 10 to 45 years), and were female. Treatment lasted over eight weeks in 59% of the studies. Study duration ranged from three months to three years. We assessed 26 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain, but most domains were at low or unclear risk of bias. We grouped outcome assessment into short-term (less than or equal to 4 weeks), medium-term (from 5 to 8 weeks), and long-term treatment (more than 8 weeks). The following results were measured at the end of treatment, which was mainly long-term for the PGA outcome and mixed length (medium-term mainly) for minor adverse events. Azelaic acid In terms of treatment response (PGA), azelaic acid is probably less effective than benzoyl peroxide (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.95; 1 study, 351 participants), but there is probably little or no difference when comparing azelaic acid to tretinoin (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.14; 1 study, 289 participants) (both moderate-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in PGA when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.38; 1 study, 229 participants; low-quality evidence), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates there may be no differences in rates of withdrawal for any reason when comparing azelaic acid with benzoyl peroxide (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.29; 1 study, 351 participants), clindamycin (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.56; 2 studies, 329 participants), or tretinoin (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.47; 2 studies, 309 participants), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). In terms of total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is a difference between azelaic acid compared to adapalene (1 study; 55 participants) or benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 30 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). There may be no difference when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.67 to 3.35; 1 study, 100 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the comparison of azelaic acid versus tretinoin, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling. Salicylic acid For PGA, there may be little or no difference between salicylic acid and tretinoin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09; 1 study, 46 participants; low-quality evidence); we are not certain whether there is a difference between salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (1 study, 86 participants; very low-quality evidence); and PGA was not measured in the comparison of salicylic acid versus benzoyl peroxide. There may be no difference between groups in withdrawals when comparing salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.50; 1 study, 86 participants); when salicylic acid was compared to tretinoin, neither group had withdrawals (both based on low-quality evidence (2 studies, 74 participants)). We are uncertain whether there is a difference in withdrawals between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants; very low-quality evidence). For total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is any difference between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants) or tretinoin (2 studies, 74 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). This outcome was not reported for salicylic acid versus pyruvic acid, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling and redness. Nicotinamide Four studies evaluated nicotinamide against clindamycin or erythromycin, but none measured PGA. Low-quality evidence showed there may be no difference in withdrawals between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.60; 3 studies, 216 participants) or erythromycin (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.22; 1 study, 158 participants), or in total minor adverse events between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.99; 3 studies, 216 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the nicotinamide versus erythromycin comparison. Alpha-hydroxy (fruit) acid There may be no difference in PGA when comparing glycolic acid peel to salicylic-mandelic acid peel (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.26; 1 study, 40 participants; low-quality evidence), and we are uncertain if there is a difference in total minor adverse events due to very low-quality evidence (1 study, 44 participants). Neither group had withdrawals (2 studies, 84 participants; low-quality evidence). Compared to benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid probably leads to a worse treatment response, measured using PGA. When compared to tretinoin, azelaic acid probably makes little or no difference to treatment response. For other comparisons and outcomes the quality of evidence was low or very low. Risk of bias and imprecision limit our confidence in the evidence. We encourage the comparison of more methodologically robust head-to-head trials against commonly used active drugs.

Bone cancer is a type of prevalent cancer that occurs both in young and adults. Bone cancer is most common in the long bones of the pelvis, arms and legs. Statistically, more than 200 cases of osteosarcoma have been reported annually in our country. Classical treatment with chemotherapeutics remains ineffective in the cure of this cancer type. Recent studies have shown that ceramide induces apoptosis at its increased levels in the cells. Thus, many studies have been conducted to cause the accumulation of ceramide molecules in the cell by different ways to induce apoptosis. NOE (Noleoylethanolamine) is a specific inhibitor of ceramidase enzymes that hydrolyze intracellular ceramides and prevent apoptosis. This study investigates the cytotoxic and apoptosis-inducing activities of NOE on human osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells. Cytotoxic effects were investigated by MTT colorimetric assay. For the detection of morphological and ultrastructural indicators of apoptosis, confocal and TEM techniques were used. Our finding indicated that NOE is effective in the inhibition of the growth of Saos-2 cells. Confocal and TEM findings showed morphological and ultrastructural changes as chromatin condensation, fragmentation of nuclei and mitochondria as well as damaged cytoskeleton and cell shrinkage. The results revealed that NOE exerts its cytotoxicity on Saos-2 cells through changing the ultrastructure and morphology of cells with clear apoptotic sparks. Causing more and more deaths, stroke has been a leading cause of death worldwide. However, success in clinical stroke trials has remained elusive.

THDCA reduced the secretion of Th1-/Th17-related cytokines (IFN-γ, IL-12p70, IL-6, IL-17A, IL-21, IL-22, and TNF-α) and the expressions of transcription factors (T-bet, STAT4, RORγt, and STAT3), but increase the production of Th2-/Treg-related cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, and TGF-β1) and the expressions of transcription factors (GATA3, STAT6, Foxp3, and Smad3) in the colon. Meanwhile, THDCA inhibited the expressions of IFN-γ, IL-17A, T-bet, and RORγt, but improved the expression of IL-4, IL-10, GATA3, and Foxp3 in the spleen. Furthermore, THDCA restored the proportion of Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg cells, and balanced the Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg immune response of colitis mice. THDCA can alleviate TNBS-induced colitis via regulating Th1/Th2 and Th17/Treg balance, which may represent a promising treatment for patients with colitis. This study aimed to determine the effect in humans of taurohyodeoxycholic acid, a 6alpha-hydroxylated bile acid with hydrophilic properties, on bile lipid secretion. Four cholecystectomized patients who had gallstones and an interrupted enterohepatic circulation were intraduodenally infused with taurohyodeoxycholic and tauroursodeoxycholic acids on separate occasions at a dose of 0.8 to 1 g/h for 3 hours. In hourly bile samples collected for 8 hours after the beginning of the infusion, biliary bile acid composition (by high-performance liquid chromatography), biliary lipid concentrations (by standard methods), and distribution of biliary carriers (by gel chromatography) were evaluated. Blood liver function tests were performed before and after the infusions. Taurohyodeoxycholic and tauroursodeoxycholic acids became the predominant biliary bile acids in all patients except for one infused with taurohyodeoxycholic acid. Taurohyodeoxycholic acid stimulated significantly greater (P < .05) cholesterol and phospholipid secretion per unit of secreted bile acid (0.098 and 0.451 micromol/micromol, respectively) compared with tauroursodeoxycholic acid (0.061 micromol/micromol for cholesterol and 0.275 micromol/micromol for phospholipids). The secretory ratio between phospholipid and cholesterol was significantly higher after infusion of taurohyodeoxycholic acid (3.88 micromol/micromol) compared with taroursodeoxycholic acid (3.09 micromol/micromol) (P < .05). Biliary enrichment with taurohyodeoxycholic acid was positively related with percent concentration of phospholipids but not with that of cholesterol. The opposite trend was observed in tauroursodeoxycholic acid-enriched biles. In both taurohyodeoxycholic acid- and tauroursodeoxycholic acid-rich bile, 80% to 90% of cholesterol was carried in a gel-chromatographic fraction corresponding to an apparent molecular weight of 80 to 200 kd. No alteration in liver function test results was observed after taurohyodeoxycholic acid infusion. In conclusion, taurohyodeoxycholic acid stimulates greater cholesterol and phospholipid secretion than tauroursodeoxycholic acid, but with a higher phospholipid/cholesterol secretory ratio. In bile enriched with both bile acids, biliary cholesterol is transported in non-micellar aggregates. Finally, in the conditions of our study, taurohyodeoxycholic acid was not hepatotoxic. The prevention of the hepatotoxic effects produced by intravenous infusion of taurochenodeoxycholic acid (TCDCA) by coinfusion with taurohyodeoxycholic acid (THDCA) was evaluated in bile fistula rats; the hepatoprotective effects of the latter were also compared with those of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA). Rats infused with TCDCA at a dose of 8 micromol/min/kg showed reduced bile flow and calcium secretion, as well as increased biliary release of alkaline phosphatase (AP) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). This was associated with a very low biliary secretion rate of TCDCA (approximately 1 micromol/min/kg). Simultaneous infusion of THDCA or TUDCA at the same dose preserved bile flow and almost totally abolished the pathological leakage of the two enzymes into bile. The effect was slightly more potent for THDCA. The maximum secretion rate of TCDCA increased to the highest value (8 micromol/min/kg) when coinfused with either of the two hepatoprotective bile acids (BA), which were efficiently and completely secreted in the bile, without metabolism. Calcium output was also restored and phospholipid (PL) secretion increased with respect to the control saline infusion. This increase was higher in the THDCA study. These data show that THDCA is highly effective in the prevention of hepatotoxicity induced by intravenous infusion of TCDCA by facilitating its biliary secretion and reducing its hepatic residence time; this was associated with selective stimulation of PL biliary secretion.

It is a colorless solid. Its salts and esters are called elaidates. Elaidic acid is an unsaturated trans fatty acid, with code C18:1 trans-9. This compound has attracted attention because it is a major trans fat found in hydrogenated vegetable oils, and trans fats have been implicated in heart disease. It is the trans isomer of oleic acid. The name of the elaidinization reaction comes from elaidic acid. Its name comes from the Ancient Greek word ἔλαιον (elaion), meaning oil. == Occurrence and bioactivity == Elaidic acid occurs mostly in industrial hydrogenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. It's also present in small amounts in caprine and bovine milk (very roughly 0.1% of the fatty acids) and in some meats.

Spears were harvested and were held dry or with bases immersed in water. The concentrations of jasmonic acid, dihydrojasmonic acid, their tryptophan conjugates, cucurbic acid and methyl jasmonate, were measured by ELISA in spears in the 10 d following harvest. A transient increase that occurred in all spear tips immediately following harvest in the concentration of jasmonates can be attributed to a wounding response. A second increase in the concentration of jasmonates occurred from 7 d after harvest but only in dry-treated spear tips indicating that jasmonates may have accumulated in response to water stress. Jasmonate levels were also monitored during natural foliar senescence. Increased levels of jasmonates occurred after the onset of senescence, implicating them as a consequence rather than a cause of senescence. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of n-3 fatty acid supplements on urine metabolite profiling and their correlation with metabolic risk factors in Chinese T2D patients. A double-blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in 59 Chinese patients with T2D, who were randomized to receive fish oil (FO), flaxseed oil (FSO) or corn oil (CO, serving as a control group) capsules for 180 days. Morning urine samples were collected before and after the intervention and were analyzed for metabolomics by UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap/MS in positive and negative ionization modes. In the FO group, levels of 2-hexenoylcarnitine (C6:1) (p < 0.001) and 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropanoic acid (CMPF) (p = 0.004) were significantly increased while hydroxyisovaleroyl carnitine (C5:OH) (p < 0.001) was significantly decreased compared with the CO group. In addition, geranylacetone (p = 0.023) and citronellyl propionate (p = 0.038) levels were significantly elevated, while dihydrojasmonic acid (p = 0.003) was significantly reduced in the FSO group compared with that in the CO group. Moreover, increased C6:1 was correlated with decreased serum triglycerides (r = -0.340, p = 0.020). The change of urine CMPF showed inverse correlation with blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (r = -0.338, p = 0.020), while C5:OH was positively correlated with apolipoprotein B (APOB) and BUN (r = 0.386, p = 0.015; r = 0.327, p = 0.025). Besides, the change of urine CMPF was positively correlated with serum CMPF (r = 0.646, p < 0.001). In conclusion, the present study confirmed that CMPF is a strong biomarker of fish oil, and indicated that marine n-3 PUFA intake might have a beneficial effect on lipid metabolism and renal function in patients with T2D. A new method is described for the determination of endogenous jasmonic acid (JA) in Lemna minor plant extracts using liquid chromatography (LC) with fluorescence detection. Plant tissues were extracted and derivatised using 9-anthryldiazomethane (ADAM reagent) prepared in situ. Accuracy and precision were improved by using the internal standard dihydrojasmonic acid (dh-JA) for the correction of JA losses during sample preparation steps. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis of ADAM derivatives of JA and dh-JA confirmed that a single molecule of JA and dh-JA was coupled with one molecule of reagent. Derivatives of JA and dh-JA were separated with gradient elution on a C18 reversed-phase column using acetonitrile/water as a mobile phase and detected by a fluorescence detector at excitation and emission wavelengths of 254 and 412 nm, respectively. The detection limits of JA and dh-JA were 2.9 ng mL(-1) and 3.7 ng mL(-1) per 50-microL injection. The method is reproducible and selective and yields single peaks for each compound regardless of isomer. The specificity and accuracy of the proposed LC/FD method was confirmed by liquid chromatography-TurboIon Spray tandem mass spectrometric (LC/MS/MS) analysis of free JA in Lemna minor samples under multiple reaction monitoring conditions.

To explore the antitumor effects and mechanism of 1,2,3,4,6-Penta-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose on human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells. A network pharmacology method was first used to predict the possible inhibition of hepatocellular carcinoma growth by 1,2,3,4,6-Penta-O-galloyl-β-D-glucose (β-PGG) through the p53 signaling pathway. Next, the Cell Counting Kit (CCK-8) assay was performed to evaluate changes in the survival rate of human hepatocellular carcinoma HepG2 cells treated with different concentrations of the drug; flow cytometry was used to detect changes in cell cycle, apoptosis, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and intracellular Ca2+ concentration; real-time fluorescence quantification and immunoblotting showed that the expression of P53 genes and proteins associated with the p53 signaling pathway was significantly increased by β-PGG treatment. It was found that β-PGG significantly inhibited survival of HepG2 cells, promoted apoptosis, decreased MMP and intracellular Ca2+ concentration, upregulated P53 gene and protein expression, increased CASP3 expression, and induced apoptosis in HepG2 cells. This study has shown that network pharmacology can accurately predict the target of β-PGG's anti-hepatocellular carcinoma action. Moreover, it was evident that β-PGG can induce apoptosis in HepG2 cells by activating the p53 signaling pathway to achieve its anti-hepatocellular carcinoma effect  Activity and selectivity are typically the first considerations when designing a drug. However, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) are equally important considerations. Peptides can provide a combination of potent binding and exquisite selectivity, as evidenced by their pervasive use as enzymes, hormones, and signaling agents within living systems. In particular, peptidic turn motifs are key elements of molecular recognition. They may be found at the exposed surfaces of globular proteins, where they are available for binding interactions with other peptides and small molecules. However, despite these advantages, peptides often make poor drugs. The amide backbone is subject to rapid enzymatic proteolysis, resulting in short half-lives. Furthermore, the ability of the amide backbone to hydrogen bond with water restricts its ability to cross membranes and, consequentially, results in poor oral bioavailability. Accordingly, the development of nonpeptidic scaffolds that mimic peptidic turn motifs represents a promising means of converting peptidic agents into more drugable molecules. In this Account, we describe the design and synthesis of beta-turn mimetics that use a beta-D-glucose scaffold, the first use of a sugar scaffold for this purpose. Somatostatin (SRIF) is a small protein (14 amino acid residues) human hormone; a shorter (6 amino acid residues) synthetic peptide, L-363,301, is a fully peptidal agonist. These two cyclic peptides share the beta-turn motif comprising Phe(7)-Trp(8)-Lys(9)-Thr(10) (d-Trp(8) in the case of L-363,301), of which the tryptophan and lysine residues in the i + 1 and i + 2 positions, respectively, are critical for binding. In 1988, we initiated a program that tested and validated the then-novel proposition that the beta-D-glucose scaffold can mimic the beta-turn in L-363,301. The beta-D-glucose scaffold proved to be an attractive mimic of a beta-turn in part because it permits the convenient attachment of amino acid side chains via facile etherification reactions, rather than carbon-carbon bond formations; it is also an inexpensive starting material with well-defined stereochemistry. From the beginning, biological assays were used alongside physical measurements to assess the relevance of the design. Our first two synthetic targets, compounds 6 and 7, bound the SRIF receptors on benchmark (AtT-20) cells, albeit weakly, consistent with the objective of the design. Subsequently, a better ligand (8) and two congeners were found to be agonists at the SRIF receptors, providing convincing evidence that the peptide backbone is not required for receptor binding or signal transduction. The unexpectedly high level of receptor affinity of selected analogs, as well as the fortuitous discovery that our peptidomimetics were active against several chemically distinct receptors, led us to hypothesize that these monosaccharides could access multiple potential binding modes. Our later studies of this sugar scaffold confirmed this property, which we termed pseudosymmetry, whereby multiple similar but nonidentical motifs are displayed within a single analog. We propose the presence of pseudosymmetry to be an element of privilege and an advantage for lead discovery. Immunogenic cell death (ICD) is a type of cell death capable of stimulating immunity against cancer through danger signals that lead to an adaptive immune response. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been shown to have a cytotoxic effect on cancer cells; however, their mechanism of action is not fully understood. The present study synthesized, characterized, and evaluated the cytotoxic effect of beta-D-glucose-reduced AgNPs (AgNPs-G) against breast cancer (BC) cells in vitro; and assess the immunogenicity of cell death in vitro and in vivo. The results showed that AgNPs-G induce cell death in a dose-dependent manner on BC cell lines. In addition, AgNPs show antiproliferative effects by interfering with the cell cycle. Regarding the detection of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), it was found that treatment with AgNPs-G induces calreticulin exposure and the release of HSP70, HSP90, HMGB1, and ATP. In vivo, prophylactic vaccination did not prevent tumor establishment; however, tumor weight was significantly lower in AgNPs-G vaccinated mice, while the survival rate increased. In conclusion, we have developed a new method for the synthesis of AgNPs-G, with in vitro antitumor cytotoxic activity on BC cells, accompanied by the release of DAMPs. In vivo, immunization with AgNPs-G failed to induce a complete immune response in mice. Consequently, additional studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism of cell death that leads to the design of strategies and combinations with clinical efficacy.

6091.0	('Xanthine', 'Xanthin', 'Xanthic oxide', 'Pseudoxanthine', 'Isoxanthine')	mouse	Xanthine ( or , from Ancient Greek ξανθός xanthós 'yellow' for its yellowish-white appearance; archaically xanthic acid; systematic name 3,7-dihydropurine-2,6-dione) is a purine base found in most human body tissues and fluids, as well as in other organisms. Several stimulants are derived from xanthine, including caffeine, theophylline, and theobromine. Xanthine is a product on the pathway of purine degradation. It is created from guanine by guanine deaminase. It is created from hypoxanthine by xanthine oxidoreductase. It is also created from xanthosine by purine nucleoside phosphorylase. Xanthine is subsequently converted to uric acid by the action of the xanthine oxidase enzyme. == Use and production == Xanthine is used as a drug precursor for human and animal medications, and is produced as a pesticide ingredient. == Clinical significance == Derivatives of xanthine (known collectively as xanthines) are a group of alkaloids commonly used for their effects as mild stimulants and as bronchodilators, notably in the treatment of asthma or influenza symptoms. In contrast to other, more potent stimulants like sympathomimetic amines, xanthines mainly act to oppose the actions of adenosine, and increase alertness in the central nervous system. === Toxicity === Methylxanthines (methylated xanthines), which include caffeine, aminophylline, IBMX, paraxanthine, pentoxifylline, theobromine, theophylline, and 7-methylxanthine (heteroxanthine), among others, affect the airways, increase heart rate and force of contraction, and at high concentrations can cause cardiac arrhythmias. In high doses, they can lead to convulsions that are resistant to anticonvulsants. Methylxanthines induce gastric acid and pepsin secretions in the gastrointestinal tract. Methylxanthines are metabolized by cytochrome P450 in the liver. If swallowed, inhaled, or exposed to the eyes in high amounts, xanthines can be harmful, and they may cause an allergic reaction if applied topically. === Pharmacology === In in vitro pharmacological studies, xanthines act as both competitive nonselective phosphodiesterase inhibitors and nonselective adenosine receptor antagonists. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors raise intracellular cAMP, activate PKA, inhibit TNF-α synthesis, and leukotriene and reduce inflammation and innate immunity. Adenosine receptor antagonists inhibit sleepiness-inducing adenosine. However, different analogues show varying potency at the numerous subtypes, and a wide range of synthetic xanthines (some nonmethylated) have been developed searching for compounds with greater selectivity for phosphodiesterase enzyme or adenosine receptor subtypes. === Pathology === People with rare genetic disorders, specifically xanthinuria and Lesch–Nyhan syndrome, lack sufficient xanthine oxidase and cannot convert xanthine to uric acid. == Possible formation in absence of life == Studies reported in 2008, based on 12C/13C isotopic ratios of organic compounds found in the Murchison meteorite, suggested that xanthine and related chemicals, including the RNA component uracil, have been formed extraterrestrially. In August 2011, a report, based on NASA studies with meteorites found on Earth, was published suggesting xanthine and related organic molecules, including the DNA and RNA components adenine and guanine, were found in outer space. == See also == DMPX Murchison meteorite Theobromine poisoning Xanthene Xanthone Xanthydrol Kidney stone disease == References ==	Xanthine	WIKIPEDIA	('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('END', -0.00016551809676457196), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.00033581978641450405), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.011050296947360039), (' MED', -0.18103854358196259), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.005243360530585051), (' INDUSTR', -0.03373364359140396), ('IAL', 0.0)])

DL-indicates the synthetic form where as D- indicates the natural form. It is the ester of acetic acid and α-tocopherol. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that vitamin E acetate is a very strong culprit of concern in the 2019 outbreak of vaping-associated pulmonary injury (VAPI), but there is not yet sufficient evidence to rule out contributions from other chemicals. Vaporization of this ester produces toxic pyrolysis products. == Use in cosmetics == α-Tocopheryl acetate is often used in dermatological products such as skin creams. It is not oxidized and can penetrate through the skin to the living cells, where about 5% is converted to free tocopherol. Claims are made for beneficial antioxidant effects. α-Tocopheryl acetate is used as an alternative to tocopherol itself because the phenolic hydroxyl group is blocked, providing a less acidic product with a longer shelf life. It is believed that the acetate is slowly hydrolyzed after it is absorbed into the skin, regenerating tocopherol and providing protection against the sun's ultraviolet rays. Tocopheryl acetate was first synthesized in 1963 by workers at Hoffmann-La Roche. Although there is widespread use of tocopheryl acetate as a topical medication, with claims for improved wound healing and reduced scar tissue, reviews have repeatedly concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support these claims. There are reports of vitamin E-induced allergic contact dermatitis from use of vitamin E derivatives such as tocopheryl linoleate and tocopherol acetate in skin care products. Incidence is low despite widespread use. == Misuse == === Ingredient in vape liquids === On September 5, 2019, the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) announced that 10 out of 18, or 56% of the samples of vape liquids sent in by states, linked to the recent vaping-related lung disease outbreak in the United States, tested positive for vitamin E acetate which had been used as a thickening agent by illicit THC vape cartridge manufacturers. On November 8, 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified vitamin E acetate as a very strong culprit of concern in the vaping-related illnesses, but has not ruled out other chemicals or toxicants as possible causes. The CDC's findings were based on fluid samples from the lungs of 29 patients with vaping-associated pulmonary injury, which provided direct evidence of vitamin E acetate at the primary site of injury in all the 29 lung fluid samples tested. Research suggests when vitamin E acetate is inhaled, it may interfere with normal lung functioning. A 2020 study found that vaporizing vitamin E acetate produced carcinogenic alkenes and benzene, but also exceptionally toxic ketene gas, which may be a contributing factor to the pulmonary injuries. == Chemistry == At room temperature, α-tocopheryl acetate is a fat-soluble liquid. It has 3 chiral centers and thus 8 stereoisomers. It is made by esterifying α-tocopherol with acetic acid. 2R,4R,8R-isomer, also known as RRR-α-tocopheryl acetate, is the most common isomer used for various purposes. This is because α-tocopherol occurs in nature primarily as RRR-α-tocopherol. α-Tocopherol acetate does not boil at atmospheric pressure and begins to degrade at 240 °C. It can be vacuum distilled: it boils at 184 °C at 0.01 mmHg, at 194 °C (0.025 mmHg) and at 224 °C (0.3 mmHg). In practice, it is not degraded notably by air, visible light or UV-radiation. It has a refractive index of 1.4950–1.4972 at 20 °C. α-Tocopherol acetate is hydrolyzed to α-tocopherol and acetic acid under suitable conditions or when ingested by people. == References ==	Alpha-tocopherol acetate	WIKIPEDIA	('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.39121827483177185), ('OD', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -0.0003335585934109986), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.06204846501350403), (' INDUSTR', -0.00035155098885297775), ('IAL', 0.0)])

Previous assessments have addressed the safety of each of the fatty acids that appear in these acyl sarcosines and sarcosinates (Coconut Acid, Oleic Acid, Lauric Acid, and Myristic Acid). In each case the fatty acid was either safe for use or safe as used in cosmetic formulations. Acyl sarcosines are considered modified fatty acids with greater solubility and increased acidity of the carboxylic acid group compared to the parent fatty acid. They are used in a large number of cosmetic formulations as hair-conditioning agents and surfactant-cleansing agents. In soaps, concentrations are reported to be as high as 12.9%. These ingredients have low oral toxicity in rats. Although cytotoxic to Chinese hamster cells in culture, acyl sarcosines and sarcosinates are not mutagenic in those cells, nor in bacterial cells in culture. Carcinogenicity data were not available. These ingredients are nonirritating and nonsensitizing to animal and human skin, although they can enhance the penetration of other ingredients through the skin. For that reason, caution should be exhibited in formulating cosmetic products that contain these ingredients in combination with other ingredients whose safety is based on their lack of absorption or where dermal absorption is a concern (e.g., HC Yellow No. 4, Disperse Yellow 3). Because sarcosine can be nitrosated to form N-nitrososarcosine, a known animal carcinogen, these ingredients should not be used in cosmetic products in which N-nitroso compounds may be formed. With the above caveat, and based on the available data, it was concluded that these acyl sarcosines and sarcosinates are safe as used in rinse-off products. They may be safely used in leave-on products at concentrations up to 5%, the highest concentration tested in clinical irritation and sensitization studies. Oleoyl Sarcosine is used as a corrosion inhibitor in some aerosol products, at extremely low concentrations. In this circumstance, the ingredient is not being used as a cosmetic ingredient and this report is not intended to limit that use. Because of the absence of data on inhalation toxicity, however, it was concluded that the available data were not sufficient to support the safety of acyl sarcosines and sarcosinates as cosmetic ingredients in products where they are likely to be inhaled.

Humans have only trace amounts of tauroursodeoxycholic acid but bears have large amounts of tauroursodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid in their bile. == Synthesis == Bile acids are naturally synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and are conjugated with specific amino-acids, specifically taurine. Bear bile contains several bile acids including taurochenodeoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, and chenodeoxycholic acid. UDCA and its taurine conjugates comprise about 47% of the bile in American black bears and up to 76% in Asiatic bears. Ursodeoxycholic acid and tauroursodeoxycholic acid were first chemically synthesized in 1954 in Japan. Ursodeoxycholic acid is produced in several countries for the treatment of gallstones and primary biliary cholangitis. == Medical uses == In Canada and the United States, ursodoxicoltaurine, in combination with sodium phenylbutyrate, was indicated for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Following failed results from the phase 3 PHOENIX trial (NCT05021536) It has been removed from the market in April 2024. Amylyx Pharmaceuticals has announced that effective immediately Relyvrio will no longer be available. == Cellular mechanisms == Apoptosis is largely influenced by the mitochondria. If the mitochondria are distressed, they release cytochrome C (cyC) and calcium which activate caspases to propagate a cascade of cellular mechanisms to cause apoptosis. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid prevents apoptosis with its role in the BAX pathway. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid prevents BAX from being transported to the mitochondria which protects the mitochondria from perturbation and the activation of caspases. Many effects of tauroursodeoxycholic acid appear to be dependent on the activation of the cell membrane receptors TGR5, S1PR2 and α5β1-Integrin. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid also acts as a chemical chaperone to help maintain the stability and correct folding of proteins. == Research == Ursodoxicoltaurine has been shown to reduce apoptosis and to have protective effects in neurodegenerative diseases and the eye, particularly for retinal degenerative disorders. Studies have shown that tauroursodeoxycholic acid has neuroprotective actions based on its potent ability to inhibit apoptosis, attenuate oxidative stress, and reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress in different experimental models of these illnesses. Studies have shown protective effects of tauroursodeoxycholic acid in eye diseases. === Photoreceptor cells === A study examined the effects of tauroursodeoxycholic acid on cones, in relation to retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a disease in which retinal rods and cones undergo apoptosis. Mice models were used, a wild-type and a mutant RP model, rd10. Both models were injected with tauroursodeoxycholic acid every 3 days from post-natal day 6 (p6) to p30 and compared to the vehicle. Electroretinography (ERG), photoreceptor cell counts, cone photoreceptor nuclei counts, and TUNEL labeling were all analyzed to show the effects of ursodoxicoltaurine. The dark-adapted and light-adapted ERG responses were greater in the ursodoxicoltaurine treated mouse than the vehicle treated mouse. Ursodoxicoltaurine treated mice also had more photoreceptor counts, yet non-altered retinal morphology or function. Even at P30, a stage where rod and cone function is usually greatly diminished in the rd10 mouse model, the photoreceptor function was protected. Another study, from the Department of Ophthalmology at Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, Maryland, saw similar effects in two components of bile, bilirubin and ursodoxicoltaurine, in relation to RP. Oxidative stress and prolonged light exposure were studied in rd10 mice and albino mice. In rd10 mice, intraperitoneal injections of bilirubin or ursodoxicoltaurine were given every 3 days starting at P6. This caused a considerable preservation in cone cell amount and function at P50, and a modest rod cell amount at P30. In the albino mice models, intraperitoneal injections of bilirubin or ursodoxicoltaurine were given prior to prolonged light exposure. Both treatments had positive effects on the health of the mouse retina, including a reduced accumulation of superoxide radicals, rod cell death, and disruption of cone inner and outer segments. The findings of the study are elucidating optimized conditions for RP treatment. === Choroidal neovascularization === A study done at the Department of Ophthalmology at Seoul National University College of Medicine examined the effects of ursodoxicoltaurine and UDCA on laser-treated choroids of rat models. Argon lasers were used to induce choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in rat models. Ursodoxicoltaurine and UDCA were injected intraperitoneally 24 hours before and daily after the laser treatment. Fourteen days after laser-treatment, the eyes were examined for effects. Fluorescein angiography showed lower leakage from the CNV in UDCA and ursodoxicoltaurine treated groups than the control group. Additionally, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in the retina were examined and showed lower levels in the ursodoxicoltaurine treated group compared to the control group, whereas no effect in the UDCA treated group. ursodoxicoltaurine and UDCA may suppress CNV formation, which may be associated with its anti-inflammatory effects. === Synaptic connectivity === A study from the Department of Physiology in University of Alicante, in Alicante, Spain, shows the effects of ursodoxicoltaurine in the P23H transgenic rat, a model of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. The transgenic rats were injected with ursodoxicoltaurine once a week starting from P21 until P120, along with vehicle-administered controls. At P120, the functionality of the retina was examined via ERG and immunoflourescent microscopy. The amplitude of the a- and b- waves were considerably higher in ursodoxicoltaurine treated rats, compared to the control group. Photoreceptor density in the center of the retina was three-fold greater in ursodoxicoltaurine treated rats. Also, TUNEL results showed smaller amounts of TUNEL-positive cells. The synaptic contacts amongst photoreceptor cells, bipolar cells, and horizontal cells were preserved in the ursodoxicoltaurine treated P23H rats. Additionally, the synaptic terminals in the outer plexiform layer were of greater density that in control rats. The neuroprotective effects of ursodoxicoltaurine are not only preserving retinal morphology and function, but also its synaptic contacts, a potentially useful aspect in delaying RP. === Other diseases === Tauroursodeoxycholic acid has also been suggested to have potential application in heart disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and stroke in view of the drug's ability to reduce apoptotic effects. == References ==	Tauroursodeoxycholic acid	WIKIPEDIA	('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.311025470495224), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.002478627720847726), (' END', -0.001036383560858667), ('OG', -5.512236498361744e-07), ('ENO', -9.65101717156358e-05), ('US', 0.0)])

In order to analyze the protective effect of bile salts differing in number and steric position of their hydroxy groups against TLC-induced cholestasis, isolated rat livers were perfused with taurocholate (TC), taurohyocholate (THC), tauroursocholate (TUC), taurodehydrocholate (TDHC), and tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDC) (16 and 32 mumol/l) with or without TLC (8 and 16 mumol/l). Bile flow, bile salt secretion, and the hydroxylation pattern of the bile salts secreted were analyzed. TLC caused complete cholestasis after 15 min of perfusion. All bile salts studied had a protective effect. THC, TC, and TUDC completely abolished the cholestasis induced by TLC while TUC did so only for the first 10 min. TDHC was protective only as long as it was biotransformed into hydroxyoxo bile salts. Coinfusion of bile salts did not influence uptake of TLC (greater than or equal to 93% of dose). Differences were found regarding the amount of TLC biotransformed (% of uptake): TC 50%; THC 32%; TUDC 36%; TUC 20%. Light microscopy revealed cellular necrosis, and dilated canaliculi were found in livers perfused with TLC only or in combination with TUC or TDHC, while the other bile salts prevented these changes. We conclude that bile salts with low micelle-forming capacity have little protective effect against TLC-induced cholestasis. These bile salts induce less biotransformation of TLC than TC, THC, and TUDC. The protective effect is not dependent on the hydrocholeretic effect of the added bile salt and is not due to an uptake inhibition. The incidence of hyperuricemia (HUA) is on the rise, posing a significant threat to human health. Several probiotics have shown potential in treating HUA; however, the critical role of intestinal metabolites in this therapy remains inadequately understood. Our study demonstrated that Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus 2016SWU.05.0601 not only reduced the expression levels of xanthine dehydrogenase and the content and activity of xanthine oxidase in the liver but also regulated the uric acid transporters expression in the kidney, thereby attenuating HUA in mice. Additionally, L. rhamnosus 2016SWU.05.0601 modulated the gut microbiota and metabolite abundance in HUA mice. Correlation analysis revealed that the gut microbiota metabolite taurohyocholate played a vital role in the treatment of HUA by L. rhamnosus 2016SWU.05.0601, as confirmed in HUA cell models. Our research provides a significant theoretical basis for elucidating the mechanisms by which probiotics alleviate HUA and for developing functional ingredients for HUA treatment.

102678.0	('Linoleic acid', 'Linolic acid', '(9z,12z)-octadeca-9,12-dienoic acid', 'Telfairic acid', 'Cis,cis-linoleic acid')	mouse	"Linoleic acid (LA) is an organic compound with the formula HOOC(CH2)7CH=CHCH2CH=CH(CH2)4CH3. Both alkene groups (−CH=CH−) are cis. It is a fatty acid sometimes denoted 18:2 (n−6) or 18:2 cis-9,12. A linoleate is a salt or ester of this acid. Linoleic acid is a polyunsaturated, omega−6 fatty acid. It is a colorless liquid that is virtually insoluble in water but soluble in many organic solvents. It typically occurs in nature as a triglyceride (ester of glycerin) rather than as a free fatty acid. It is one of two essential fatty acids for humans, who must obtain it through their diet, and the most essential, because the body uses it as a base to make the others. The word ""linoleic"" derives from Latin linum 'flax' and oleum 'oil', reflecting the fact that it was first isolated from linseed oil. == History == In 1844, F. Sacc, working at the laboratory of Justus von Liebig, isolated linoleic acid from linseed oil. In 1886, K. Peters determined the existence of two double bonds. Its essential role in human diet was discovered by G. O. Burr and others in 1930. Its chemical structure was determined by T. P. Hilditch and others in 1939, and it was synthesized by R. A. Raphael and F. Sondheimer in 1950. == In physiology == The consumption of linoleic acid is vital to proper health, as it is an essential fatty acid. === Metabolism and eicosanoids === Linoleic acid (LA: C18H32O2; 18:2,n−6) is a precursor to arachidonic acid (AA: C20H32O2; 20:4,n−6) with elongation and unsaturation. AA is the precursor to some prostaglandins, leukotrienes (LTA, LTB, LTC), thromboxane (TXA) and the N-acylethanolamine (NAE) arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA: C22H37NO2; 20:4,n−6), and other endocannabinoids and eicosanoids. The metabolism of LA to AA begins with the conversion of LA into gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), effected by Δ6 desaturase. GLA is converted to dihomo-γ-linolenic acid (DGLA), the immediate precursor to AA. LA is also converted by various lipoxygenases, cyclooxygenases, cytochrome P450 enzymes (the CYP monooxygenases), and non-enzymatic autoxidation mechanisms to mono-hydroxyl products viz., 13-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid, and 9-Hydroxyoctadecadienoic acid; these two hydroxy metabolites are enzymatically oxidized to their keto metabolites, 13-oxo-octadecadienoic acid and 9-oxo-octadecdienoic acid. Certain cytochrome P450 enzymes, the CYP epoxygenases, catalyze oxidation of LA to epoxide products viz., its 12,13-epoxide, vernolic acid, and its 9,10-epoxide, coronaric acid. These linoleic acid products are implicated in human physiology and pathology. Hydroperoxides derived from the metabolism of anandamide (AEA: C22H37NO2; 20:4,n−6), or its linoleoyl analogues, are by a lipoxygenase action found to be competitive inhibitors of brain and immune cell FAAH, the enzyme that breaks down AEA and other endocannabinoids, and the compound linoleoyl-ethanol-amide (C20H37NO2; 18:2,n−6), an N-acylethanolamine, - the ethanolamide of linoleic acid (LA: C18H32O2; 18:2,n−6) and its metabolized incorporated ethanolamine (MEA: C2H7NO), is the first natural inhibitor of FAAH, discovered. == Uses and reactions == Linoleic acid is a component of quick-drying oils, which are useful in oil paints and varnishes. These applications exploit the lability of the doubly allylic C−H groups (−CH=CH−CH2−CH=CH−) toward oxygen in air (autoxidation). Addition of oxygen leads to crosslinking and formation of a stable film. Reduction of the carboxylic acid group of linoleic acid yields linoleyl alcohol. Linoleic acid is a surfactant with a critical micelle concentration of 1.5 x 10−4 M @ pH 7.5. Linoleic acid has become increasingly popular in the beauty products industry because of its beneficial properties on the skin. Research points to linoleic acid's anti-inflammatory, acne reductive, skin-lightening and moisture retentive properties when applied topically on the skin. Linoleic acid is also used in some bar of soap products. == Dietary sources == It is abundant in safflower, and corn oil, and comprises over half their composition by weight. It is present in medium quantities in soybean oils, sesame, and almonds. === Other occurrences === Cockroaches release oleic and linoleic acid upon death, which discourages other roaches from entering the area. This is similar to the mechanism found in ants and bees, which release oleic acid upon death. == Health effects == Consumption of linoleic acid has been associated with lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and premature death. There is high-quality evidence that increased intake of linoleic acid decreases total blood cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein. Higher in vivo circulating and tissue levels of linoleic acid are associated with a lower risk of major cardiovascular events. Clinical trials have shown that increased linoleic acid intake does not increase markers of inflammation or oxidative stress. The American Heart Association advises people to replace saturated fat with linoleic acid to reduce CVD risk. == See also == Conjugated linoleic acid Essential fatty acid interactions Essential nutrients Linolein == References == == Further reading == ""Compound Summary: Linoleic acid"".

Thus, in the present study, we aimed to provide critical evidence regarding brain accumulation of a memory-improving soy dipeptide, Tyr-Pro, following oral administration. Stable isotope-labeled Tyr-Pro (Tyr-[ The dipeptide Tyr-Pro has physiological potential for intact transportability into the brain parenchyma, prevention of cognitive impairment, and an adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) agonistic effect. The present study aimed to understand the effect of Tyr-Pro on the acetylcholine (ACh) nervous system and its underlying mechanism in NE-4C nerve cells. Concentration-dependent ACh production was induced by stimulation with Tyr-Pro and AdipoRon (an AdipoR1 agonist), along with the expression of AdipoR1 and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in NE-4C cells. By knocking down AdipoR1 in the cells, Tyr-Pro promoted ChAT expression, along with the activations of AMPK and ERK 1/2. Tyr-Pro did not alter acetylcholinesterase or ACh receptors, indicating that the dipeptide might operate as an ACh accelerator in nerve cells. This study provides the first evidence that the AdipoR1 agonistic Tyr-Pro is a promising dipeptide responsible for the stimulation of the ACh nervous system by AdipoR1-induced ChAT activation. In our previous study, yeast-derived peptide Tyr-Pro-Leu-Pro (YPLP) was found to prolong treadmill time and relieve muscle fatigue in ICR mice. The present study aimed to further investigate the antifatigue mechanism of YPLP. Three doses of YPLP (10, 25, and 50 mg/kg·d) were given to exercise mice for 4 weeks. Results showed that YPLP reduced the oxidative response via the nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway and promoted energy metabolism through the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. Label-free proteomics results showed that 81 differential abundance proteins (DAPs) were regulated by high-dose YPLP. These DAPs belonged to proteasome, mitochondrial, and muscle proteins. YPLP was mainly involved in proteasome, aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, focal adhesion, and MAPK signal pathways to enhance muscle endurance. Furthermore, real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting results proved that YPLP upregulated Psmd14 expression and downregulated p38 MAPK expression. Overall, this study revealed the mechanism behind YPLP to alleviate exercise fatigue.	Tyr-pro	PUBMED	('FOOD', [('FO', -0.035242579877376556), ('OD', 0.0)])
3472.0	('Methionine', 'H-met-oh', '(s)-2-amino-4-(methylthio)butanoic acid', 'Cymethion', 'S-methionine')	mouse	"Methionine (symbol Met or M) () is an essential amino acid in humans. As the precursor of other non-essential amino acids such as cysteine and taurine, versatile compounds such as SAM-e, and the important antioxidant glutathione, methionine plays a critical role in the metabolism and health of many species, including humans. Methionine is also involved in angiogenesis and various processes related to DNA transcription, epigenetic expression, and gene regulation. Methionine was first isolated in 1921 by John Howard Mueller. It is encoded by the codon AUG. It was named by Satoru Odake in 1925, as an abbreviation of its structural description 2-amino-4-(methylthio)butanoic acid. == Biochemical details == Methionine (abbreviated as Met or M; encoded by the codon AUG) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains a carboxyl group (which is in the deprotonated −COO− form under biological pH conditions), an amino group (which is in the protonated −NH+3 form under biological pH conditions) located in α-position with respect to the carboxyl group, and an S-methyl thioether side chain, classifying it as a nonpolar, aliphatic amino acid. In nuclear genes of eukaryotes and in Archaea, methionine is coded for by the start codon, meaning it indicates the start of the coding region and is the first amino acid produced in a nascent polypeptide during mRNA translation. == A proteinogenic amino acid == Cysteine and methionine are the two sulfur-containing proteinogenic amino acids. Excluding the few exceptions where methionine may act as a redox sensor (e.g.,methionine sulfoxide), methionine residues do not have a catalytic role. This is in contrast to cysteine residues, where the thiol group has a catalytic role in many proteins. The thioether within methionine does however have a minor structural role due to the stability effect of S/π interactions between the side chain sulfur atom and aromatic amino acids in one-third of all known protein structures. This lack of a strong role is reflected in experiments where little effect is seen in proteins where methionine is replaced by norleucine, a straight hydrocarbon sidechain amino acid which lacks the thioether. It has been conjectured that norleucine was present in early versions of the genetic code, but methionine intruded into the final version of the genetic code due to the fact it is used in the cofactor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM-e). This situation is not unique and may have occurred with ornithine and arginine. === Encoding === Methionine is one of only two amino acids encoded by a single codon (AUG) in the standard genetic code (tryptophan, encoded by UGG, is the other). In reflection to the evolutionary origin of its codon, the other AUN codons encode isoleucine, which is also a hydrophobic amino acid. In the mitochondrial genome of several organisms, including metazoa and yeast, the codon AUA also encodes for methionine. In the standard genetic code AUA codes for isoleucine and the respective tRNA (ileX in Escherichia coli) uses the unusual base lysidine (bacteria) or agmatidine (archaea) to discriminate against AUG. The methionine codon AUG is also the most common start codon. A ""Start"" codon is message for a ribosome that signals the initiation of protein translation from mRNA when the AUG codon is in a Kozak consensus sequence. As a consequence, methionine is often incorporated into the N-terminal position of proteins in eukaryotes and archaea during translation, although it can be removed by post-translational modification. In bacteria, the derivative N-formylmethionine is used as the initial amino acid. == Derivatives == === S-Adenosylmethionine === The methionine-derivative S-adenosylmethionine (SAM-e) is a cofactor that serves mainly as a methyl donor. SAM-e is composed of an adenosyl molecule (via 5′ carbon) attached to the sulfur of methionine, therefore making it a sulfonium cation (i.e., three substituents and positive charge). The sulfur acts as a soft Lewis acid (i.e., donor/electrophile) which allows the S-methyl group to be transferred to an oxygen, nitrogen, or aromatic system, often with the aid of other cofactors such as cobalamin (vitamin B12 in humans). Some enzymes use SAM-e to initiate a radical reaction; these are called radical SAM-e enzymes. As a result of the transfer of the methyl group, S-adenosylhomocysteine is obtained. In bacteria, this is either regenerated by methylation or is salvaged by removing the adenine and the homocysteine, leaving the compound dihydroxypentandione to spontaneously convert into autoinducer-2, which is excreted as a waste product or quorum signal. == Biosynthesis == As an essential amino acid, methionine is not synthesized de novo in humans and other animals, which must ingest methionine or methionine-containing proteins. In plants and microorganisms, methionine biosynthesis belongs to the aspartate family, along with threonine and lysine (via diaminopimelate, but not via α-aminoadipate). The main backbone is derived from aspartic acid, while the sulfur may come from cysteine, methanethiol, or hydrogen sulfide. First, aspartic acid is converted via β-aspartyl semialdehyde into homoserine by two reduction steps of the terminal carboxyl group (homoserine has therefore a γ-hydroxyl, hence the homo- series). The intermediate aspartate semialdehyde is the branching point with the lysine biosynthetic pathway, where it is instead condensed with pyruvate. Homoserine is the branching point with the threonine pathway, where instead it is isomerised after activating the terminal hydroxyl with phosphate (also used for methionine biosynthesis in plants). Homoserine is then activated with a phosphate, succinyl or an acetyl group on the hydroxyl. In plants and possibly in some bacteria, phosphate is used. This step is shared with threonine biosynthesis. In most organisms, an acetyl group is used to activate the homoserine. This can be catalysed in bacteria by an enzyme encoded by metX or metA (not homologues). In enterobacteria and a limited number of other organisms, succinate is used. The enzyme that catalyses the reaction is MetA and the specificity for acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA is dictated by a single residue. The physiological basis for the preference of acetyl-CoA or succinyl-CoA is unknown, but such alternative routes are present in some other pathways (e.g. lysine biosynthesis and arginine biosynthesis). The hydroxyl activating group is then replaced with cysteine, methanethiol, or hydrogen sulfide. A replacement reaction is technically a γ-elimination followed by a variant of a Michael addition. All the enzymes involved are homologues and members of the Cys/Met metabolism PLP-dependent enzyme family, which is a subset of the PLP-dependent fold type I clade. They utilise the cofactor PLP (pyridoxal phosphate), which functions by stabilising carbanion intermediates. If it reacts with cysteine, it produces cystathionine, which is cleaved to yield homocysteine. The enzymes involved are cystathionine-γ-synthase (encoded by metB in bacteria) and cystathionine-β-lyase (metC). Cystathionine is bound differently in the two enzymes allowing β or γ reactions to occur. If it reacts with free hydrogen sulfide, it produces homocysteine. This is catalysed by O-acetylhomoserine aminocarboxypropyltransferase (formerly known as O-acetylhomoserine (thiol)-lyase. It is encoded by either metY or metZ in bacteria. If it reacts with methanethiol, it produces methionine directly. Methanethiol is a byproduct of catabolic pathway of certain compounds, therefore this route is more uncommon. If homocysteine is produced, the thiol group is methylated, yielding methionine. Two methionine synthases are known; one is cobalamin (vitamin B12) dependent and one is independent. The pathway using cysteine is called the ""transsulfuration pathway"", while the pathway using hydrogen sulfide (or methanethiol) is called ""direct-sulfurylation pathway"". Cysteine is similarly produced, namely it can be made from an activated serine and either from homocysteine (""reverse transsulfurylation route"") or from hydrogen sulfide (""direct sulfurylation route""); the activated serine is generally O-acetylserine (via CysK or CysM in E. coli), but in Aeropyrum pernix and some other archaea O-phosphoserine is used. CysK and CysM are homologues, but belong to the PLP fold type III clade. === Transsulfurylation pathway === Enzymes involved in the E. coli transsulfurylation route of methionine biosynthesis: Aspartokinase Aspartate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase Homoserine dehydrogenase Homoserine O-transsuccinylase Cystathionine-γ-synthase Cystathionine-β-lyase Methionine synthase (in mammals, this step is performed by homocysteine methyltransferase or betaine—homocysteine S-methyltransferase.) == Other biochemical pathways == Although mammals cannot synthesize methionine, they can still use it in a variety of biochemical pathways: === Catabolism === Methionine is converted to S-adenosylmethionine (SAM-e) by (1) methionine adenosyltransferase. SAM-e serves as a methyl donor in many (2) methyltransferase reactions, and is converted to S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH). (3) Adenosylhomocysteinase cysteine. === Regeneration === Methionine can be regenerated from homocysteine via (4) methionine synthase in a reaction that requires vitamin B12 as a cofactor. Homocysteine can also be remethylated using glycine betaine (N,N,N-trimethylglycine, TMG) to methionine via the enzyme betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase (E.C.2.1.1.5, BHMT). BHMT makes up to 1.5% of all the soluble protein of the liver, and recent evidence suggests that it may have a greater influence on methionine and homocysteine homeostasis than methionine synthase. === Reverse-transulfurylation pathway: conversion to cysteine === Homocysteine can be converted to cysteine. (5) Cystathionine-β-synthase (an enzyme which requires pyridoxal phosphate, the active form of vitamin B6) combines homocysteine and serine to produce cystathionine. Instead of degrading cystathionine via cystathionine-β-lyase, as in the biosynthetic pathway, cystathionine is broken down to cysteine and α-ketobutyrate via (6) cystathionine-γ-lyase. (7) The enzyme α-ketoacid dehydrogenase converts α-ketobutyrate to propionyl-CoA, which is metabolized to succinyl-CoA in a three-step process (see propionyl-CoA for pathway). === Ethylene synthesis === This amino acid is also used by plants for synthesis of ethylene. The process is known as the Yang cycle or the methionine cycle. == Metabolic diseases == The degradation of methionine is impaired in the following metabolic diseases: Combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA) Homocystinuria Methylmalonic acidemia Propionic acidemia == Chemical synthesis == The industrial synthesis combines acrolein, methanethiol, and cyanide, which affords the hydantoin. Racemic methionine can also be synthesized from diethyl sodium phthalimidomalonate by alkylation with chloroethylmethylsulfide (ClCH2CH2SCH3) followed by hydrolysis and decarboxylation. Also see Methanol. == Human nutrition == There is inconclusive clinical evidence on methionine supplementation. Dietary restriction of methionine can lead to bone-related disorders. Methionine supplementation may benefit those suffering from copper poisoning. Overconsumption of methionine, the methyl group donor in DNA methylation, is related to cancer growth in a number of studies. === Requirements === The Food and Nutrition Board of the U.S. Institute of Medicine set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for essential amino acids in 2002. For methionine combined with cysteine, for adults 19 years and older, 19 mg/kg body weight/day. This translates to about 1.33 grams per day for a 70 kilogram individual. === Dietary sources === High levels of methionine can be found in eggs, meat, and fish; sesame seeds, Brazil nuts, and some other plant seeds; and cereal grains. Most fruits and vegetables contain very little. Most legumes, though protein dense, are low in methionine. Proteins without adequate methionine are not considered to be complete proteins. For that reason, racemic methionine is sometimes added as an ingredient to pet foods. == Health == Loss of methionine has been linked to senile greying of hair. Its lack leads to a buildup of hydrogen peroxide in hair follicles, a reduction in tyrosinase effectiveness, and a gradual loss of hair color. Methionine raises the intracellular concentration of glutathione, thereby promoting antioxidant-mediated cell defense and redox regulation. It also protects cells against dopamine induced nigral cell loss by binding oxidative metabolites. Methionine is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of cysteine, carnitine, taurine, lecithin, phosphatidylcholine, and other phospholipids. Improper conversion of methionine can lead to atherosclerosis due to accumulation of homocysteine. == Other uses == DL-Methionine is sometimes given as a supplement to dogs; It helps reduce the chances of kidney stones in dogs. Methionine is also known to increase the urinary excretion of quinidine by acidifying the urine. Aminoglycoside antibiotics used to treat urinary tract infections work best in alkaline conditions, and urinary acidification from using methionine can reduce its effectiveness. If a dog is on a diet that acidifies the urine, methionine should not be used. Methionine is allowed as a supplement to organic poultry feed under the US certified organic program. Methionine can be used as a nontoxic pesticide option against giant swallowtail caterpillars, which are a serious pest to orange crops. == See also == Allantoin Formylmethionine Methionine oxidation Paracetamol poisoning Photoreactive methionine S-Methylcysteine == References == == External links == Rudra MN, Chowdhury LM (30 September 1950).

88518.0	('Dapc', 'Epitope id:140960', 'A-lecithin-diarachidonoyl', 'Diarachidonyl lecithin', 'Pc(20:4/20:4)')	mouse	 There are over 30 mouse models with mutations or inactivations in the dystrophin-associated protein complex. This complex is thought to play a crucial role in the functioning of muscle, as both a shock absorber and signalling centre, although its role in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy is not fully understood. The first mouse model of muscular dystrophy to be identified with a mutation in a component of the dystrophin-associated complex (dystrophin) was the mdx mouse in 1984. Here, we evaluate the key characteristics of the mdx in comparison with other mouse mutants with inactivations in DAPC components, along with key modifiers of the disease phenotype. By discussing the differences between the individual phenotypes, we show that the functioning of the DAPC and consequently its role in the pathogenesis is more complicated than perhaps currently appreciated. Inference of genetic clusters is a key aim of population genetics, sparking development of numerous analytical methods. Within these, there is a conceptual divide between finding de novo structure versus assessment of a priori groups. Recently developed, Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC), combines discriminant analysis (DA) with principal component (PC) analysis. When applying DAPC, the groups used in the DA (specified a priori or described de novo) need to be carefully assessed. While DAPC has rapidly become a core technique, the sensitivity of the method to misspecification of groups and how it is being empirically applied, are unknown. To address this, we conducted a simulation study examining the influence of a priori versus de novo group designations, and a literature review of how DAPC is being applied. We found that with a priori groupings, distance between genetic clusters reflected underlying F Multiple components of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DAPC) are expressed in numerous tissues including the brain. Members of the DAPC and dysbindin are abnormally expressed in the brain of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) patients, which has been associated with cognitive impairments. However, little is known about the expression pattern of individual members of the DAPC in animal models of DMD and their relationship with dysbindin. Ten mdx mice were randomly allocated into a control and intervention group [(-)-epicatechin (Epi) 1mg/kg/day for four weeks] and results compared to a wild-type mice. After sacrifice, brain pre-frontal cortices were collected for Western blotting and immunoprecipitation assays, and sagittal sections processed for immunohistochemistry. Epi promotes a partial recovery of DAPC members [α1-Syntrophin, sarcoglycans (SG), dystrophin 71 (Dp71)], dysbindin, and utrophin protein levels. Epi also appears to restore the association of DAPC between dysbindin, and utrophin with Dp71 and ε-SG. Co-immunostaining evidence increased protein levels of dysbindin, dystrophin, and ε-SG and their colocalization. Altogether, results suggest that Epi is capable of restoring pre-frontal cortex DAPC and dysbindin levels of mdx mice towards that of healthy brains. The functional implications of such studies warrant further investigation.	Dapc	PUBMED	('INFO', [('INFO', 0.0)])
61757.0	('Triphenyltetrazolium', 'Gnf-pf-5041', 'Cbdive_016098', 'Iflab1_000263')	mouse	 Irreversible electroporation (IRE) is a tissue ablation method, uses short high electric pulses and results in cell death in target tissue by irreversibly permeabilizing the cell membrane. Potato is commonly used as a tissue model for electroporation experiments. The blackened area that forms 12 h after electric pulsing is regarded as an IRE-ablated area caused by melanin accumulation. Here, the 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) was used as a dye to assess the IRE-ablated area 3 h after potato model ablation. Comparison between the blackened area and TTC-unstained white area in various voltage conditions showed that TTC staining well delineated the IRE-ablated area. Moreover, whether the ablated area was consistent over time and at different staining times was investigated. In addition, the presumed reversible electroporation (RE) area was formed surrounding the IRE-ablated area. Overall, TTC staining can provide a more rapid and accurate electroporated area evaluation. The widespread use of polymer composite materials (PCM) leads to an increase in non-recyclable waste. This paper discusses the feasibility of recycling fiberglass with an epoxy matrix by solvolysis in ethanol under supercritical conditions. The solvolysis process completes successfully within four hours in an environment of a pure solvent containing 10% water at a temperature of 280 °C when the solvent passes into the supercritical state. The treatment time increases up to 10 h at a process temperature of 250 °C. When using a coordination compound of copper(II) chloride with organic chloride salt having 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium as the counterion, having the composition of (2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium) Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) is one of the most conventional stains to detect infarcted area of the heart in animal experiments. However, its availability and limitations have not been thoroughly discussed in the forensic field. Here, authors stained human hearts with TTC soon after the harvest. Photographs of the samples were analyzed using image analysis software, which evaluated the occupying ratio of the stained area on the surface of each slice. The results showed that the stainability of TTC declines with the length of the postmortem interval (PMI). Specimens reacted well to TTC within 1.5 days after death and then decreased the stainability logarithmically with PMI (y = - 0.294 In (x) + 1.0441; x = PMI, y = TTC-stained area / total myocardial area, R = 0.5673). Samples with old myocardial infarction produced clear TTC contrast; normal tissue is vivid red, and fibrotic myocardium is white discoloration. In acute myocardial infarction cases where death occurred within 9 hours after the attack, however, the detection of infarcted area was very difficult even when PMI was less than 1.5 days. In summary, the TTC method may be useful within 1.5 days after death, but short suffering period before death disturbs its staining efficiency.

21990.0	('Tryptophan', 'H-trp-oh', 'Tryptophane', '(s)-tryptophan', 'Trofan')	mouse	"Tryptophan (symbol Trp or W) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Tryptophan contains an α-amino group, an α-carboxylic acid group, and a side chain indole, making it a polar molecule with a non-polar aromatic beta carbon substituent. Tryptophan is also a precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin, the hormone melatonin, and vitamin B3 (niacin). It is encoded by the codon UGG. Like other amino acids, tryptophan is a zwitterion at physiological pH where the amino group is protonated (–NH+3; pKa = 9.39) and the carboxylic acid is deprotonated ( –COO−; pKa = 2.38). Humans and many animals cannot synthesize tryptophan: they need to obtain it through their diet, making it an essential amino acid. Tryptophan is named after the digestive enzymes trypsin, which were used in its first isolation from casein proteins. It was assigned the one-letter symbol W based on the double ring being visually suggestive to the bulky letter. == Function == Amino acids, including tryptophan, are used as building blocks in protein biosynthesis, and proteins are required to sustain life. Tryptophan is among the less common amino acids found in proteins, but it plays important structural or functional roles whenever it occurs. For instance, tryptophan and tyrosine residues play special roles in ""anchoring"" membrane proteins within the cell membrane. Tryptophan, along with other aromatic amino acids, is also important in glycan-protein interactions. In addition, tryptophan functions as a biochemical precursor for the following compounds: Serotonin (a neurotransmitter), synthesized by tryptophan hydroxylase. Melatonin (a neurohormone) is in turn synthesized from serotonin, via N-acetyltransferase and 5-hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase enzymes. Kynurenine, to which tryptophan is mainly (more than 95%) metabolized. Two enzymes, namely indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in the immune system and the brain, and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) in the liver, are responsible for the synthesis of kynurenine from tryptophan. The kynurenine pathway of tryptophan catabolism is altered in several diseases, including psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder. Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is synthesized from tryptophan via kynurenine and quinolinic acids. Auxins (a class of phytohormones) are synthesized from tryptophan. The disorder fructose malabsorption causes improper absorption of tryptophan in the intestine, reduced levels of tryptophan in the blood, and depression. In bacteria that synthesize tryptophan, high cellular levels of this amino acid activate a repressor protein, which binds to the trp operon. Binding of this repressor to the tryptophan operon prevents transcription of downstream DNA that codes for the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of tryptophan. So high levels of tryptophan prevent tryptophan synthesis through a negative feedback loop, and when the cell's tryptophan levels go down again, transcription from the trp operon resumes. This permits tightly regulated and rapid responses to changes in the cell's internal and external tryptophan levels. == Recommended dietary allowance == In 2002, the U.S. Institute of Medicine set a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of 5 mg/kg body weight/day of tryptophan for adults 19 years and over. === Dietary sources === Tryptophan is present in most protein-based foods or dietary proteins. It is particularly plentiful in chocolate, oats, dried dates, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, red meat, eggs, fish, poultry, sesame, chickpeas, almonds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, hemp seeds, buckwheat, spirulina, and peanuts. Contrary to the popular belief that cooked turkey contains an abundance of tryptophan, the tryptophan content in turkey is typical of poultry. == Medical use == === Depression === Because tryptophan is converted into 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) which is then converted into the neurotransmitter serotonin, it has been proposed that consumption of tryptophan or 5-HTP may improve depression symptoms by increasing the level of serotonin in the brain. Tryptophan is sold over the counter in the United States (after being banned to varying extents between 1989 and 2005) and the United Kingdom as a dietary supplement for use as an antidepressant, anxiolytic, and sleep aid. It is also marketed as a prescription drug in some European countries for the treatment of major depression. There is evidence that blood tryptophan levels are unlikely to be altered by changing the diet, but consuming purified tryptophan increases the serotonin level in the brain, whereas eating foods containing tryptophan does not. In 2001 a Cochrane review of the effect of 5-HTP and tryptophan on depression was published. The authors included only studies of a high rigor and included both 5-HTP and tryptophan in their review because of the limited data on either. Of 108 studies of 5-HTP and tryptophan on depression published between 1966 and 2000, only two met the authors' quality standards for inclusion, totaling 64 study participants. The substances were more effective than placebo in the two studies included but the authors state that ""the evidence was of insufficient quality to be conclusive"" and note that ""because alternative antidepressants exist which have been proven to be effective and safe, the clinical usefulness of 5-HTP and tryptophan is limited at present"". The use of tryptophan as an adjunctive therapy in addition to standard treatment for mood and anxiety disorders is not supported by the scientific evidence. === Insomnia === The American Academy of Sleep Medicine's 2017 clinical practice guidelines recommended against the use of tryptophan in the treatment of insomnia due to poor effectiveness. == Side effects == Potential side effects of tryptophan supplementation include nausea, diarrhea, drowsiness, lightheadedness, headache, dry mouth, blurred vision, sedation, euphoria, and nystagmus (involuntary eye movements). == Interactions == Tryptophan taken as a dietary supplement (such as in tablet form) has the potential to cause serotonin syndrome when combined with antidepressants of the MAOI or SSRI class or other strongly serotonergic drugs. Because tryptophan supplementation has not been thoroughly studied in a clinical setting, its interactions with other drugs are not well known. == Isolation == The isolation of tryptophan was first reported by Frederick Hopkins in 1901. Hopkins recovered tryptophan from hydrolysed casein, recovering 4–8 g of tryptophan from 600 g of crude casein. == Biosynthesis and industrial production == As an essential amino acid, tryptophan is not synthesized from simpler substances in humans and other animals, so it needs to be present in the diet in the form of tryptophan-containing proteins. Plants and microorganisms commonly synthesize tryptophan from shikimic acid or anthranilate: anthranilate condenses with phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP), generating pyrophosphate as a by-product. The ring of the ribose moiety is opened and subjected to reductive decarboxylation, producing indole-3-glycerol phosphate; this, in turn, is transformed into indole. In the last step, tryptophan synthase catalyzes the formation of tryptophan from indole and the amino acid serine. The industrial production of tryptophan is also biosynthetic and is based on the fermentation of serine and indole using either wild-type or genetically modified bacteria such as B. amyloliquefaciens, B. subtilis, C. glutamicum or E. coli. These strains carry mutations that prevent the reuptake of aromatic amino acids or multiple/overexpressed trp operons. The conversion is catalyzed by the enzyme tryptophan synthase. == Society and culture == === Showa Denko contamination scandal === There was a large outbreak of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) in the U.S. in 1989, with more than 1,500 cases reported to the CDC and at least 37 deaths. After preliminary investigation revealed that the outbreak was linked to intake of tryptophan, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recalled tryptophan supplements in 1989 and banned most public sales in 1990, with other countries following suit. Subsequent studies suggested that EMS was linked to specific batches of L-tryptophan supplied by a single large Japanese manufacturer, Showa Denko. It eventually became clear that recent batches of Showa Denko's L-tryptophan were contaminated by trace impurities, which were subsequently thought to be responsible for the 1989 EMS outbreak. However, other evidence suggests that tryptophan itself may be a potentially major contributory factor in EMS. There are also claims that a precursor reached sufficient concentrations to form a toxic dimer. The FDA loosened its restrictions on sales and marketing of tryptophan in February 2001, but continued to limit the importation of tryptophan not intended for an exempted use until 2005. The fact that the Showa Denko facility used genetically engineered bacteria to produce the contaminated batches of L-tryptophan later found to have caused the outbreak of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome has been cited as evidence of a need for ""close monitoring of the chemical purity of biotechnology-derived products"". Those calling for purity monitoring have, in turn, been criticized as anti-GMO activists who overlook possible non-GMO causes of contamination and threaten the development of biotech. === Turkey meat and drowsiness hypothesis === A common assertion in the US and the UK is that heavy consumption of turkey meat—as seen during Thanksgiving and Christmas—results in drowsiness, due to high levels of tryptophan contained in turkey. However, the amount of tryptophan in turkey is comparable with that of other meats. Drowsiness after eating may be caused by other foods eaten with the turkey, particularly carbohydrates. Ingestion of a meal rich in carbohydrates triggers the release of insulin. Insulin in turn stimulates the uptake of large neutral branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), but not tryptophan, into muscle, increasing the ratio of tryptophan to BCAA in the blood stream. The resulting increased tryptophan ratio reduces competition at the large neutral amino acid transporter (which transports both BCAA and aromatic amino acids), resulting in more uptake of tryptophan across the blood–brain barrier into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Once in the CSF, tryptophan is converted into serotonin in the raphe nuclei by the normal enzymatic pathway. The resultant serotonin is further metabolised into the hormone melatonin—which is an important mediator of the circadian rhythm—by the pineal gland. Hence, these data suggest that ""feast-induced drowsiness""—or postprandial somnolence—may be the result of a heavy meal rich in carbohydrates, which indirectly increases the production of melatonin in the brain, and thereby promotes sleep. == Research == === Yeast amino acid metabolism === In 1912 Felix Ehrlich demonstrated that yeast metabolizes the natural amino acids essentially by splitting off carbon dioxide and replacing the amino group with a hydroxyl group. By this reaction, tryptophan gives rise to tryptophol. === Serotonin precursor === Tryptophan affects brain serotonin synthesis when given orally in a purified form and is used to modify serotonin levels for research. Low brain serotonin level is induced by administration of tryptophan-poor protein in a technique called acute tryptophan depletion. Studies using this method have evaluated the effect of serotonin on mood and social behavior, finding that serotonin reduces aggression and increases agreeableness. === Psychedelic effects === Tryptophan produces the head-twitch response (HTR) in rodents when administered at sufficiently high doses. The HTR is induced by serotonergic psychedelics like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin and is a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects. Tryptophan is converted into the trace amine tryptamine and tryptamine is N-methylated by indolethylamine N-methyltransferase (INMT) into N-methyltryptamine (NMT) and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (N,N-DMT), which are known serotonergic psychedelics. === Fluorescence === Tryptophan is an important intrinsic fluorescent probe (amino acid), which can be used to estimate the nature of the microenvironment around the tryptophan residue. Most of the intrinsic fluorescence emissions of a folded protein are due to excitation of tryptophan residues. == See also == 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) α-Methyltryptophan Acree–Rosenheim reaction Adamkiewicz reaction Attenuator (genetics) N,N-Dimethyltryptamine Hopkins–Cole reaction Serotonin Tryptamine == References == == Further reading == == External links =="	Tryptophan	WIKIPEDIA	('FOOD, MEDICAL', [('FO', -0.01799868792295456), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.10022026300430298), (' MED', -0.038616843521595), ('ICAL', 0.0)])
96116.0	('Palmitoylethanolamide', 'Palmidrol', 'N-(2-hydroxyethyl)hexadecanamide', 'Palmitoyl ethanolamide', 'Palmitamide mea')	mouse	"Palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) is an endogenous fatty acid amide, and lipid modulator. A main target of PEA is proposed to be the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-α). PEA also has affinity to cannabinoid-like G-coupled receptors GPR55 and GPR119. PEA cannot strictly be considered a classic endocannabinoid because it lacks affinity for the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. == Early and recent studies == In 1975, Czech physicians described the results of a clinical trial looking at joint pain, where the analgesic action of aspirin versus PEA was tested; both drugs were reported to enhance joint movements and decrease pain. In 1970 the drug manufacturer Spofa in Czechoslovakia introduced Impulsin, a tablet dose of PEA, for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza and other respiratory infections. In Spain, the company Almirall introduced Palmidrol in tablet and suspension forms in 1976, for the same indications. In the mid-1990s, the relationship between anandamide and PEA was described; the expression of mast cell receptors sensitive to the two molecules was demonstrated by Levi-Montalcini and coworkers. During this period, more insight into the functions of endogenous fatty acid derivatives emerged, and compounds such as oleamide, palmitoylethanolamide, 2-lineoylglycerol and 2-palmitoylglycerol were explored for their capacity to modulate pain sensitivity and inflammation via what at that time was thought to be the endocannabinoid signalling pathway. Primary reports also have provided evidence that PEA downregulates hyperactive mast cells in a dose-dependent manner, and that it alleviates pain elicited in mouse models. PEA and related compounds such as anandamide also seem to have synergistic effects in models of pain and analgesia. == Animal models == In a variety of animal models, PEA seems to have some promise; researchers have been able to demonstrate relevant clinical efficacy in a variety of disorders, from multiple sclerosis to neuropathic pain. In the mouse forced swimming test, palmitoylethanolamide was comparable to fluoxetine for depression. An Italian study published in 2011 found that PEA reduced the raised intraocular pressure of glaucoma. In a spinal trauma model, PEA reduced the resulting neurological deficit via the reduction of mast cell infiltration and activation. PEA in this model also reduced the activation of microglia and astrocytes. Its activity as an inhibitor of inflammation counteracts reactive astrogliosis induced by beta-amyloid peptide, in a model relevant for neurodegeneration, probably via the PPAR-α mechanism of action. In models of stroke and other CNS trauma, PEA exerted neuroprotective properties. == Animal models of chronic pain and inflammation == Chronic pain and neuropathic pain are indications for which there is high unmet need in the clinic. PEA has been tested in a variety of animal models for chronic and neuropathic pain, because cannabinoids, such as THC, have been proven to be effective in neuropathic pain states. The analgesic and antihyperalgesic effects of PEA in two models of acute and persistent pain seemed to be explained at least partly via the de novo neurosteroid synthesis. In chronic granulomatous pain and inflammation model, PEA could prevent nerve formation and sprouting, mechanical allodynia, and PEA inhibited dorsal root ganglia activation, which is a hallmark for winding up in neuropathic pain. The mechanism of action of PEA as an analgesic and anti-inflammatory molecule is probably based on different aspects. PEA inhibits the release of both preformed and newly synthesised mast cell mediators, such as histamine and TNF-alpha. PEA, as well as its analogue adelmidrol (di-amide derivative of azelaic acid), can both down-regulate mast cells. PEA reduces the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and prevents IkB-alpha degradation and p65 NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, the latter related to PEA as an endogenous PPAR-alpha agonist. In 2012 it became clear that PEA can also reduce reperfusion injury and the negative impact of shock on various outcome parameters, such as renal dysfunction, ischemic injury and inflammation, most probably via the PPAR-alpha pathway. Studies have shown that PEA activates PPAR-alpha and TRPV1 receptors that control inflammation and the sensation of pain. Among the reperfusion and inflammation markers measured PEA could reduce the increase in creatinine, γGT, AST, nuclear translocation of NF-κBp65; kidney MPO activity and MDA levels, nitrotyrosine, PAR and adhesion molecules expression, the infiltration and activation of mast cells and apoptosis. The biological responses to PEA dosing in animal models and in humans are being investigated vis-à-vis its involvement in a repair mechanism relevant to patient conditions of chronic inflammation and chronic pain. In a model of visceral pain (inflammation of the urinary bladder) PEA was able to attenuate the viscero-visceral hyper-reflexia induced by inflammation of the urinary bladder, one of the reasons why PEA is currently explored in the painful bladder syndrome. In a different model for bladder pain, the turpentine-induced urinary bladder inflammation in the rat, PEA also attenuated a referred hyperalgesia in a dose-dependent way. Chronic pelvic pain in patients seem to respond favourably to a treatment with PEA. == Activity in non-neuronal cells == PEA, as an N-acylethanolamine, has physico-chemical properties comparable to anandamide, and, while it is not strictly an endocannabinoid, it is often studied in conjunction with anandamide because of their overlapping synthetic and metabolic pathways. N-acylethanolamines such as PEA often act as signaling molecules, activating receptors and regulating a variety of physiological functions. PEA is known to activate intracellular, nuclear and membrane-associated receptors, and to regulate many physiological functions related to the inflammatory cascade and chronic pain states. Endocannabinoid lipids like PEA are widely distributed in nature, in a variety of plant, invertebrate, and mammalian tissues. PEA's mechanism of action sometimes is described as Autacoid Local Injury Antagonism (acronym ALIA), and PEA under this nomenclature is an ALIAmide. Levi-Montalcini and coworkers presented evidence in 1993 that lipid amides of the N-acylethanolamine type, such as PEA, are potential prototypes of naturally occurring molecules capable of modulating mast cell activation, and her group used the acronym ALIA in that report. An autocoid is a regulating molecule, locally produced. An ALIAmide is an autocoid synthesized on-demand in response to injury, and acts locally to counteract such pathology. Soon after the breakthrough paper of Levi-Montalcini, the mast cell appeared to be an important target for the anti-inflammatory activity of PEA. Since 1993, at least 25 papers have been published on the various effects of PEA on mast cells. These cells are often found in proximity to sensory nerve endings, and their degranulation can enhance the nociceptive signal, the reason why peripheral mast cells are considered to be pro-inflammatory and pro-nociceptive. PEA's activity is currently seen as a new inroad in the treatment of neuropathic pain and related disorders based on overactivation of glia and glia-related cells, such as in diabetes and glaucoma. Microglia plays a key role in the winding up phenomenon and central sensitization. == Clinical relevance == The effects of oral dosing of PEA have been explored in humans, and include clinical trials for a variety of pain states, for inflammatory and pain syndromes. Daily doses range from 300 to 1200 mg per day. In a 2017 systematic meta-analysis involving 10 studies including data from 786 patients receiving PEA for pain-related indications and 512 controls, PEA was found to be associated with pain reduction significantly greater than observed in controls (P < 0.001). Positive influences have also been observed in dermal applications, specifically atopic eczema, which may be linked to PPAR alpha activation. In a 2015 analysis of a double blind placebo controlled study of PEA in sciatic pain, the Numbers Needed to Treat was 1.5. Its positive influence in chronic pain, and inflammatory states such as atopic eczema, seems to originate mainly from PPAR alpha activation. Since 2012 a number of new trials have been published, among which studies in glaucoma. PEA also seems to be one of the factors responsible for the decrease in pain sensitivity during and after sport, comparable to the endogenous opiates (endorphines). From a clinical perspective the most important and promising indications for PEA are linked to neuropathic and chronic pain states, such as diabetic neuropathic pain, sciatic pain, CRPS, pelvic pain and entrapment neuropathic pain states. In a blind trial reported in a conference proceeding, patients affected by pain from synovitis or TMJ osteoarthritis (N=25, in total) were randomly assigned to PEA or ibuprofen groups for two weeks; the decrease in pain reported after two weeks was significantly higher for the PEA-treated group, likewise for improved masticatory function. In 2012, 20 patients with thalidomide and bortezomib induced neuropathy were reported to have improved nerve functions and less pain after a two-month treatment with PEA. The authors pointed out that although a placebo effect might play a role in the reported pain relief, the changes in neurophysiological measures clearly indicated that PEA exerted a positive action on the myelinated fibre groups. Sixteen men and fourteen women with two major types of neuropathic pain refractory to analgesic treatment—peripheral diabetic neuropathy (4 men, 7 women) or post-herpetic neuralgia (12 men, 7 women)—whose symptoms spanned eight pain categories (""burning"", ""osteoarticular"", ""piercing"", etc.) who were under prior treatment with pregabalin were transferred to PEA, after which pregabalin treatment was gradually reintroduced; all were responding well after 45 days, and presented significant decreases in pain scores (without drug-drug interactions). In 2013, a metareview was published on the clinical efficacy and safety of PEA in the treatment of the common cold and influenza, based on reports from six double-blind, placebo, randomized controlled trials, addressing PEA's proposed anti-inflammatory and retinoprotectant effects. In 2019, significant increases in fatty acid amides including PEA, arachidonoylethanolamide, and oleoylethanolamide were noted in a Scottish woman with a previously undocumented variant of congenital insensitivity to pain. This was found to be a result of a combination of a hypomorphic single nucleotide polymorphism of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), alongside a mutation of the pseudogene, FAAH-OUT. The pseudogene was previously considered to be non-coding DNA, FAAH-OUT was found to be capable of modulating the expression of FAAH, making it a possible future target for novel analgesia/anxiolytic drug development. In 2020, PEA has been suggested as a drug that may prove beneficial for the treatment of lung inflammation caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection. A pharmaceutical company called FSD Pharma have entered PEA into a Phase 1 clinical trial under the name FSD-201, and has approval from the FDA for progressing to Phase 2a for this indication. == Metabolism == PEA is metabolized by the cellular enzymes fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and N-acylethanolamine acid amide hydrolase (NAAA), the latter of which has more specificity toward PEA over other fatty acid amides. == Safety == PEA is generally considered safe, and without adverse drug reactions (ADRs) or drug interactions. A 2016 study assessing safety claims in sixteen clinical trials, six case reports/pilot studies and a meta‐analysis of PEA as an analgesic, concluded that for treatment periods up to 49 days, clinical data argued against serious ADRs at an incidence of 1/200 or greater. A 2016 pooled meta-analysis involving twelve studies found that no serious ADRs were registered and/or reported. No data on interactions with PEA have been reported. Based on its mechanism, PEA may be considered likely to interact with other PPAR-α agonists used to treat high triglycerides; this remains unconfirmed. == See also == N-Acylethanolamine N-Acylphosphatidylethanolamine == References == == Further reading =="	Palmitoylethanolamide	WIKIPEDIA	('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.011267447844147682), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.2664456789934775e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.00012368128227535635), (' MED', -0.14286799728870392), ('ICAL', 0.0)])
3787.0	('Uridine', 'Uridin', 'Uracil riboside', 'Beta-uridine', 'Uracil, 1-beta-d-ribofuranosyl-')	mouse	"Uridine (symbol U or Urd) is a glycosylated pyrimidine analog containing uracil attached to a ribose ring (or more specifically, a ribofuranose) via a β-N1-glycosidic bond. The analog is one of the five standard nucleosides which make up nucleic acids, the others being adenosine, thymidine, cytidine and guanosine. The five nucleosides are commonly abbreviated to their symbols, U, A, dT, C, and G, respectively. However, thymidine is more commonly written as 'dT' ('d' represents 'deoxy') as it contains a 2'-deoxyribofuranose moiety rather than the ribofuranose ring found in uridine. This is because thymidine is found in deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and usually not in ribonucleic acid (RNA). Conversely, uridine is found in RNA and not DNA. The remaining three nucleosides may be found in both RNA and DNA. In RNA, they would be represented as A, C and G whereas in DNA they would be represented as dA, dC and dG. == Biosynthesis == Uridine is widely produced in nature as uridine monophosphate (uridylate) by de novo synthesis by the decarboxylation of orotidylate, which is catalyzed by orotidylate decarboxylase. The orotidylate is produced from orotate, which is combined with 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) to form orotidylate by pyrimidine phosphoribosyltransferase. PRPP is created from ribose-5-phosphate by a further phosphorylation, serving as an energetic molecule to drive the reaction forward, while orotate is generated in several steps from carbamoyl phosphate and aspartate. == Dietary sources == Uridine is regarded as a non-essential nutrient, as it is produced by the human body as needed and supplementation is not generally recommended, though it has been explored for specific applications. Some foods that contain uridine in the form of RNA are listed below. Although claimed that virtually none of the uridine in this form is bioavailable ""since – as shown by Handschumacher's Laboratory at Yale School of Medicine in 1981 – it is destroyed in the liver and gastrointestinal tract, and no food, when consumed, has ever been reliably shown to elevate blood uridine levels'. This is contradicted by Yamamoto et al., plasma uridine levels rose 1.8-fold 30 minutes after beer ingestion, suggesting, at the very least, conflicting data. On the other hand, ethanol on its own (which is present in beer) increases uridine levels, which may explain the raise of uridine levels in the study by Yamamoto et al. In infants consuming mother's milk or commercial infant formulas, uridine is present as its monophosphate, UMP, which is both bioavailable and able to enter the circulation from the digestive tract. goat's and sheep's milk and milk products Sugarcane extract Tomatoes (0.5 to 1.0 g uridine per kilogram dry weight) Brewer's yeast (1.7% uridine by dry weight) Beer Broccoli Organ meats (liver, pancreas, etc.) Consumption of RNA-rich foods may lead to high levels of purines (adenine and guanosine) in blood. High levels of purines are known to increase uric acid production and may aggravate or lead to conditions such as gout. Harvard researchers report that omega-3 fatty acids and uridine, two substances in foods such as fish, walnuts, molasses, and sugar beets, prevented depression in rats as effectively as antidepressant drugs. ""Giving rats a combination of uridine and omega-3 fatty acids produced immediate effects that were indistinguishable from those caused by giving the rats standard antidepressant medications,"" said lead author of the study William Carlezon, director of McLean's Behavioral Genetics Laboratory. == Galactose glycolysis == Uridine plays a role in the glycolysis pathway of galactose. There is no catabolic process to metabolize galactose. Therefore, galactose is converted to glucose and metabolized in the common glucose pathway. Once the incoming galactose has been converted into galactose 1-phosphate (Gal-1-P), it is involved in a reaction with UDP-glucose, a glucose molecule bonded to uridine diphosphate (UDP). This process is catalyzed by the enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase and transfers the UDP to the galactose molecule. The end result is UDP-galactose and glucose-1-phosphate. This process is continued to allow the proper glycolysis of galactose. == See also == Deoxyuridine monophosphate Pseudouridine Uridine monophosphate == References =="	Uridine	WIKIPEDIA	('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.00044008632539771497), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.00010914575977949426), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.0007102862582542002), (' FOOD', -6.611323624383658e-05)])

36757.0	('Mannitol', 'Mannite', 'Osmitrol', 'Manna sugar', 'Cordycepic acid')	mouse	"Mannitol is a type of sugar alcohol used as a sweetener and medication. It is used as a low calorie sweetener as it is poorly absorbed by the intestines. As a medication, it is used to decrease pressure in the eyes, as in glaucoma, and to lower increased intracranial pressure. Medically, it is given by injection or inhalation. Effects typically begin within 15 minutes and last up to 8 hours. Common side effects from medical use include electrolyte problems and dehydration. Other serious side effects may include worsening heart failure and kidney problems. It is unclear if use is safe in pregnancy. Mannitol is in the osmotic diuretic family of medications and works by pulling fluid from the brain and eyes. The discovery of mannitol is attributed to Joseph Louis Proust in 1806. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It was originally made from the flowering ash and called manna due to its supposed resemblance to the Biblical food. Mannitol is on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned substances list due to concerns that it may mask prohibited drugs. == Uses == === Medical uses === In the United States, mannitol is indicated for the reduction of intracranial pressure and treatment of cerebral edema and elevated intraocular pressure. In the European Union, mannitol is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in adults aged 18 years and above as an add-on therapy to best standard of care. Mannitol is used intravenously to reduce acutely raised intracranial pressure until more definitive treatment can be applied, e.g., after head trauma. While mannitol injection is the mainstay for treating high pressure in the skull after a bad brain injury, it is no better than hypertonic saline as a first-line treatment. In treatment-resistant cases, hypertonic saline works better. Intra-arterial infusions of mannitol can transiently open the blood–brain barrier by disrupting tight junctions. It may also be used for certain cases of kidney failure with low urine output, decreasing pressure in the eye, to increase the elimination of certain toxins, and to treat fluid build up. Intraoperative mannitol prior to vessel clamp release during renal transplant has been shown to reduce post-transplant kidney injury, but has not been shown to reduce graft rejection. Mannitol acts as an osmotic laxative in oral doses larger than 20 g, and is sometimes sold as a laxative for children. The use of mannitol, when inhaled, as a bronchial irritant as an alternative method of diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma has been proposed. A 2013 systematic review concluded evidence to support its use for this purpose at this time is insufficient. Mannitol is commonly used in the circuit prime of a heart lung machine during cardiopulmonary bypass. The presence of mannitol preserves renal function during the times of low blood flow and pressure, while the patient is on bypass. The solution prevents the swelling of endothelial cells in the kidney, which may have otherwise reduced blood flow to this area and resulted in cell damage. Mannitol can also be used to temporarily encapsulate a sharp object (such as a helix on a lead for an artificial pacemaker) while it passes through the venous system. Because the mannitol dissolves readily in blood, the sharp point becomes exposed at its destination. Mannitol is also the first drug of choice to treat acute glaucoma in veterinary medicine. It is administered as a 20% solution intravenously. It dehydrates the vitreous humor and, therefore, lowers the intraocular pressure. However, it requires an intact blood-ocular barrier to work. === Food === Mannitol increases blood glucose to a lesser extent than sucrose (thus having a relatively low glycemic index) so is used as a sweetener for people with diabetes, and in chewing gums. Although mannitol has a higher heat of solution than most sugar alcohols, its comparatively low solubility reduces the cooling effect usually found in mint candies and gums. However, when mannitol is completely dissolved in a product, it induces a strong cooling effect. Also, it has a very low hygroscopicity – it does not pick up water from the air until the humidity level is 98%. This makes mannitol very useful as a coating for hard candies, dried fruits, and chewing gums, and it is often included as an ingredient in candies and chewing gum. The pleasant taste and mouthfeel of mannitol also makes it a popular excipient for chewable tablets. === Analytical chemistry === Mannitol can be used to form a complex with boric acid. This increases the acid strength of the boric acid, permitting better precision in volumetric analysis of this acid. === Other === Mannitol is the primary ingredient of mannitol salt agar, a bacterial growth medium, and is used in others. Mannitol is used as a cutting agent in various drugs that are used intranasally (snorted), such as heroin and cocaine. A mixture of mannitol and fentanyl (or fentanyl analogs) in ratio 1:10 is labeled and sold as ""China white"", a popular heroin substitute. Mannitol is a sugar alcohol with ""50-70 percent of the relative sweetness of sugar, which means more must be used to equal the sweetness of sugar. Mannitol lingers in the intestines for a long time and therefore often causes bloating and diarrhea."" == Contraindications == Mannitol is contraindicated in people with anuria, severe hypovolemia, pre-existing severe pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and active intracranial bleeding except during craniotomy. Adverse effects include hyponatremia and volume depletion leading to metabolic acidosis. == Chemistry == Mannitol is an isomer of sorbitol, another sugar alcohol; the two differ only in the orientation of the hydroxyl group on carbon 2. While similar, the two sugar alcohols have very different sources in nature, melting points, and uses. == Production == Mannitol is classified as a sugar alcohol; that is, it can be derived from a sugar (mannose) by reduction. Other sugar alcohols include xylitol and sorbitol. === Industrial synthesis === Mannitol is commonly produced via the hydrogenation of fructose, which is formed from either starch or sucrose (common table sugar). Although starch is a cheaper source than sucrose, the transformation of starch is much more complicated. Eventually, it yields a syrup containing about 42% fructose, 52% glucose, and 6% maltose. Sucrose is simply hydrolyzed into an invert sugar syrup, which contains about 50% fructose. In both cases, the syrups are chromatographically purified to contain 90–95% fructose. The fructose is then hydrogenated over a nickel catalyst into a mixture of isomers sorbitol and mannitol. Yield is typically 50%:50%, although slightly alkaline reaction conditions can slightly increase mannitol yields. === Biosyntheses === Mannitol is one of the most abundant energy and carbon storage molecules in nature, produced by a plethora of organisms, including bacteria, yeasts, fungi, algae, lichens, and many plants. Fermentation by microorganisms is an alternative to the traditional industrial synthesis. A fructose to mannitol metabolic pathway, known as the mannitol cycle in fungi, has been discovered in a type of red algae (Caloglossa leprieurii), and it is highly possible that other microorganisms employ similar such pathways. A class of lactic acid bacteria, labeled heterofermentive because of their multiple fermentation pathways, convert either three fructose molecules or two fructose and one glucose molecule into two mannitol molecules, and one molecule each of lactic acid, acetic acid, and carbon dioxide. Feedstock syrups containing medium to large concentrations of fructose (for example, cashew apple juice, containing 55% fructose: 45% glucose) can produce yields 200 g (7.1 oz) mannitol per liter of feedstock. Further research is being conducted, studying ways to engineer even more efficient mannitol pathways in lactic acid bacteria, as well as the use of other microorganisms such as yeast and E. coli in mannitol production. When food-grade strains of any of the aforementioned microorganisms are used, the mannitol and the organism itself are directly applicable to food products, avoiding the need for careful separation of microorganism and mannitol crystals. Although this is a promising method, steps are needed to scale it up to industrially needed quantities. === Natural extraction === Since mannitol is found in a wide variety of natural products, including almost all plants, it can be directly extracted from natural products, rather than chemical or biological syntheses. In fact, in China, isolation from seaweed is the most common form of mannitol production. Mannitol concentrations of plant exudates can range from 20% in seaweeds to 90% in the plane tree. It is a constituent of saw palmetto (Serenoa). Traditionally, mannitol is extracted by the Soxhlet extraction, using ethanol, water, and methanol to steam and then hydrolysis of the crude material. The mannitol is then recrystallized from the extract, generally resulting in yields of about 18% of the original natural product. Another method of extraction is using supercritical and subcritical fluids. These fluids are at such a stage that no difference exists between the liquid and gas stages, so are more diffusive than normal fluids. This is considered to make them much more effective mass transfer agents than normal liquids. The super- or subcritical fluid is pumped through the natural product, and the mostly mannitol product is easily separated from the solvent and minute amount of byproduct. Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction of olive leaves has been shown to require less solvent per measure of leaf than a traditional extraction – 141.7 g (5.00 oz) CO2 versus 194.4 g (6.86 oz) ethanol per 1 g (0.035 oz) olive leaf. Heated, pressurized, subcritical water is even cheaper, and is shown to have dramatically greater results than traditional extraction. It requires only 4.01 g (0.141 oz) water per 1 g (0.035 oz) of olive leaf, and gives a yield of 76.75% mannitol. Both super- and subcritical extractions are cheaper, faster, purer, and more environmentally friendly than the traditional extraction. However, the required high operating temperatures and pressures are causes for hesitancy in the industrial use of this technique. == History == In the early 1880s, Julije Domac elucidated the structure of hexene and mannitol obtained from Caspian manna. He determined the place of the double bond in hexene obtained from mannitol and proved that it is a derivative of a normal hexene. This also solved the structure of mannitol, which was unknown until then. == Controversy == The three studies that originally found high-dose mannitol effective in treating severe head injury were the subject of an investigation. Published in 2007 after the lead author Dr Julio Cruz's death, the investigation questioned whether the studies had actually taken place. The co-authors of the paper were not able to confirm the existence of the study patients, and the Federal University of São Paulo, which Cruz gave as his affiliation, had never employed him. As a result of doubt surrounding Cruz's work, an updated version of the Cochrane review excludes all studies by Julio Cruz, leaving only four studies. Due to differences in selection of control groups, a conclusion about the clinical use of mannitol has not been reached. == Compendial status == British Pharmacopoeia Japanese Pharmacopoeia United States Pharmacopeia == See also == == References == == External links == Media related to Mannitol at Wikimedia Commons"	Mannitol	WIKIPEDIA	('MEDICAL, FOOD, INDUSTRIAL', [('MED', -0.023249322548508644), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.00022594700567424297), (',', -0.4745074510574341), (' INDUSTR', -0.016992919147014618), ('IAL', 0.0)])

Daily samples of bile were obtained, and biliary bile acids were extracted and purified to determine bile acid kinetics. During ursocholic acid therapy ursocholic acid became the principal bile acid (35% +/- 3% of total bile acids, mean +/- S.E.M.), and the percentage of biliary cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids decreased (p less than 0.05). Cholic acid production fell from 190 +/- 15 mg/day to 135 +/- 20 mg/day (p = 0.078). The total bile acid pool was increased twofold (p less than 0.05), whereas the deoxycholic acid pool was enlarged from 440 +/- 170 mg to 1,175 +/- 90 mg (p less than 0.02). As much as 28% of the fed ursocholic acid was excreted in the urine, 85% as the free acid and 15% as the glycine conjugate. During treatment, ursocholic acid became the source for 69% +/- 11% of biliary deoxycholic acid. The time course of the deoxycholic acid specific activity was modeled as a single pool precursor-product system with a variable time delay for the C-7-dehydroxylation of cholic and ursocholic acids (mean delay 0.86 +/- 0.11 days, p less than 0.001 vs. zero delay). Most of this delay probably arises from a slow process of bacterial C-7-dehydroxylation within the colon. These results demonstrate that during ursocholic acid therapy the synthesis of primary bile acids continues whereas the formation of secondary bile acids is greatly increased. The preventive effect of 3 alpha, 7 beta, 12 alpha-trihydroxy-5 beta-cholanoic acid (ursocholic acid) and ursodeoxycholic acid on the formation of biliary cholesterol crystals was studied in mice. Cholesterol crystals developed with 80% incidence after feeding for five weeks a lithogenic diet containing 0.5% cholesterol and 0.25% sodium cholate. When 0.25% ursocholic acid or ursodeoxycholic acid was added to the lithogenic diet, the incidence as well as the grade (severity) of the gallstones were reduced. Plasma and liver cholesterol levels were decreased by ursodeoxycholic acid but not by ursocholic acid. Gallbladder cholesterol and phospholipid levels were decreased by both bile acids. The biliary bile acid level was decreased by ursocholic acid but not by ursodeoxycholic acid. After feeding ursocholic acid, its level in the bile was about 25% and the levels of cholic acid and beta-muricholic acid decreased. Fecal sterol excretion was not changed by ursocholic acid, but was increased by ursodeoxycholic acid. After feeding ursocholic acid, fecal excretion of deoxycholic acid, cholic acid, and ursocholic acid increased. No differences were found between mice, with or without gallstones, in plasma and liver cholesterol levels, biliary phospholipid and bile acid levels, fecal sterol and bile acid levels, and biliary and fecal bile acid composition. The results suggest that the lower incidence of crystal formation after treatment with ursocholic acid is probably by a different mechanism than with ursodeoxycholic acid. In the mouse model, ursodeoxycholic acid exerts its effect at least partially, by decreasing cholesterol absorption. Ursocholic acid is well absorbed and excreted into bile and transformed into deoxycholic acid by the intestinal microflora in mice. The biliary bile acid and bile lipid responses to six weeks treatment with approximately 5, 10, and 15 mg/kg/day of ursocholic acid (UCA) were studied in 11 gall stone patients. Maximum enrichment of bile with UCA (24 (SE) 4.9%) occurred with 15 mg UCA/kg/day. The maximum reduction in biliary cholesterol saturation was seen with the 10 mg/kg/day dose when the moles % cholesterol fell from 14 (2.4)% before treatment to 5.6 (0.83)% (p less than 0.02) and the saturation index fell from 1.4 (0.23) to 0.77 (0.13) (p less than 0.05). Clinical studies of the safety and efficacy of UCA in dissolving gall stones were carried out in 13 patients treated for up to two years with a dose of approximately 10 mg/kg/day. Diarrhoea caused withdrawal of treatment in three patients. There were no significant changes in liver function or haematology tests but fasting serum cholesterol tended to rise during treatment. Of nine patients treated for greater than 6 months, only one showed complete gall stone dissolution. As UCA may cause diarrhoea and hypercholesterolaemia, has only a modest effect on biliary cholesterol saturation and low gall stone dissolution efficacy, it is unlikely to replace existing forms of gall stone dissolution therapy.

42917.0	('Azithromycin', 'Zithromax', 'Sumamed', 'Hemomycin', 'Azasite')	mouse	"Azithromycin, sold under the brand names Zithromax (in oral form) and Azasite (as an eye drop), is an antibiotic medication used for the treatment of several bacterial infections. This includes middle ear infections, strep throat, pneumonia, traveler's diarrhea, and certain other intestinal infections. Along with other medications, it may also be used for malaria. It is administered by mouth, into a vein, or into the eye. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and upset stomach. An allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis, or a type of diarrhea caused by Clostridioides difficile is possible. Azithromycin causes QT prolongation that may cause life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. No harm has been found with its use during pregnancy. Its safety during breastfeeding is not confirmed, but it is likely safe. Azithromycin is an azalide, a type of macrolide antibiotic. It works by decreasing the production of protein, thereby stopping bacterial growth. Azithromycin was discovered in Yugoslavia (present day Croatia) in 1980 by the pharmaceutical company Pliva and approved for medical use in 1988. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization lists it as an example under ""Macrolides and ketolides"" in its Critically Important Antimicrobials for Human Medicine (designed to help manage antimicrobial resistance). It is available as a generic medication and is sold under many brand names worldwide. In 2022, it was the 78th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Azithromycin is used to treat diverse infections, including: Acute bacterial sinusitis due to H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, or S. pneumoniae. A 1999 study found Azithromycin to be faster in resolving symptoms as compared to amoxicillin / clavulanic. Acute otitis media caused by H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis or S. pneumoniae. A 2021 study concluded that Azithromycin was comparable to amoxicillin/clavulanate in its treatment and that it was safer and more tolerable in children. Community-acquired pneumonia due to C. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. pneumoniae, or S. pneumoniae. Genital ulcer disease (chancroid) in men due to H. ducreyi Pharyngitis or tonsillitis caused by S. pyogenes as an alternative to first-line therapy in individuals who cannot use first-line therapy Prevention and treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, or S. pneumoniae. The benefits of long-term prophylaxis must be weighed on a patient-by-patient basis against the risk of cardiovascular and other adverse effects. Trachoma due to C. trachomatis Uncomplicated skin infections due to S. aureus, S. pyogenes, or S. agalactiae Whooping cough caused by B. pertussis. Scrub typhus caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi. === Bacterial susceptibility === Azithromycin has relatively broad but shallow antibacterial activity. It inhibits some Gram-positive bacteria, some Gram-negative bacteria, and many atypical bacteria. Aerobic and facultative Gram-positive microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus (Methicillin-sensitive only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes Aerobic and facultative anaerobic Gram-negative microorganisms Bordetella pertussis Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Legionella pneumophila Moraxella catarrhalis Neisseria gonorrhoeae Anaerobic microorganisms Peptostreptococcus species Prevotella bivia Other microorganisms Chlamydia trachomatis Chlamydophila pneumoniae Mycoplasma genitalium Mycoplasma pneumoniae Ureaplasma urealyticum === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === While some studies claim that no harm has been found with use during pregnancy, more recent studies with mice during late pregnancy has shown adverse effects on embryonic testicular and neural development of prenatal azithromycin exposure (PAzE) . One recent study claims obvious fetus changes were observed under high-dose, mid-pregnancy and multi-course exposure. However, there need to be more well-controlled studies in pregnant women. The safety of the medication during breastfeeding is unclear. It was reported that because only low levels are found in breast milk and the medication has also been used in young children, it is unlikely that breastfed infants would have adverse effects. === Airway diseases === Azithromycin has beneficial effects in the treatment of asthma. It possesses antibacterial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory properties which contribute to its effectiveness. Asthma exacerbations can be caused by chronic neutrophilic inflammation, and azithromycin is known to reduce this type of inflammation due to its immunomodulatory properties. The recommended dosage for controlling asthma exacerbations with azithromycin is either 500 mg or 250 mg taken orally as tablets three times a week. In adults with severe asthma, low-dose azithromycin may be prescribed as an add-on treatment when standard therapies such as inhaled corticosteroids or long-acting beta2-agonists are not sufficient. Long-term use of azithromycin in patients with persistent symptomatic asthma aims to decrease the frequency of asthma exacerbations and improve their quality of life. While both its anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects play crucial roles in treating asthma, studies suggest that responsiveness to azithromycin therapy depends on individual variations in lung bacterial burden and microbial composition, collectively referred to as the lung microbiome. The richness (diversity) of the lung microbiome has been identified as a key factor in determining the effectiveness of azithromycin treatment. Azithromycin has significant interactions with the patient's microbiome. Long-term use of azithromycin reduces the presence of H. influenzae bacteria in the airways but also increases resistance against macrolide antibiotics. The specific pharmacological mechanisms through which azithromycin interacts with the patient's microbiome remain unknown as of 2024; research continues to explore how changes in microbial composition influence drug efficacy and patient outcomes. Azithromycin appears to be effective in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease through its suppression of inflammatory processes. Azithromycin is potentially useful in sinusitis via this mechanism. Azithromycin is believed to produce its effects through suppressing certain immune responses that may contribute to inflammation of the airways. == Adverse effects == Most common adverse effects are diarrhea (5%), nausea (3%), abdominal pain (3%), and vomiting. Fewer than 1% of people stop taking the drug due to side effects. Nervousness, skin reactions, and anaphylaxis have been reported. Clostridioides difficile infection has been reported with use of azithromycin. Azithromycin does not affect the efficacy of birth control unlike some other antibiotics such as rifampin. Hearing loss has been reported. Occasionally, people have developed cholestatic hepatitis or delirium. Accidental intravenous overdose in an infant caused severe heart block, resulting in residual encephalopathy. In 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning that azithromycin ""can cause abnormal changes in the electrical activity of the heart that may lead to a potentially fatal irregular heart rhythm."" The FDA noted in the warning a 2012 study that found the drug may increase the risk of death, especially in those with heart problems, compared with those on other antibiotics such as amoxicillin or no antibiotic. The warning indicated people with preexisting conditions are at particular risk, such as those with abnormalities in the QT interval, low blood levels of potassium or magnesium, a slower than normal heart rate, or those who use certain drugs to treat abnormal heart rhythms. The warning mentioned that azithromycin causes QT prolongation that may cause life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. == Interactions == === Colchicine === Azithromycin, should not be taken with colchicine as it may lead to colchicine toxicity. Symptoms of colchicine toxicity include gastrointestinal upset, fever, myalgia, pancytopenia, and organ failure. === Drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 === CYP3A4 is an enzyme that metabolizes many drugs in the liver. Some drugs can inhibit CYP3A4, which means they reduce its activity and increase the blood levels of the drugs that depend on it for elimination. This can lead to adverse effects or drug-drug interactions. Azithromycin is a member of macrolides that are a class of antibiotics with a cyclic structure with a lactone ring and sugar moieties. Macrolides can inhibit CYP3A4 by a mechanism called mechanism-based inhibition (MBI), which involves the formation of reactive metabolites that bind covalently and irreversibly to the enzyme, rendering it inactive. Mechanism-based inhibition is more serious and long-lasting than reversible inhibition, as it requires the synthesis of new enzyme molecules to restore the activity. The degree of mechanism-based inhibition by macrolides depends on the size and structure of their lactone ring. Clarithromycin and erythromycin have a 14-membered lactone ring, which is more prone to demethylation by CYP3A4 and subsequent formation of nitrosoalkenes, the reactive metabolites that cause mechanism-based inhibition. Azithromycin, on the other hand, has a 15-membered lactone ring, which is less susceptible to demethylation and nitrosoalkene formation. Therefore, azithromycin is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, while clarithromycin and erythromycin are strong inhibitors which increase the area under the curve (AUC) value of co-administered drugs more than five-fold. AUC it is a measure of the drug exposure in the body over time. By inhibiting CYP3A4, macrolide antibitiotics, such as erythromycin and clarithromycin, but not azithromycin, can significantly increase the AUC of the drugs that depend on it for clearance, which can lead to higher risk of adverse effects or drug-drug interactions. Azithromycin stands apart from other macrolide antibiotics because it is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, and does not significantly increase AUC value of co-administered drugs. The difference in CYP3A4 inhibition by macrolides has clinical implications, for example for people who take statins, which are cholesterol-lowering drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4. Co-administration of clarithromycin or erythromycin with statins can increase the risk of statin-induced myopathy, a condition that causes muscle pain and damage. Azithromycin, however, does not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of statins and is considered a safer alternative than other macrolide antibiotics. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Azithromycin prevents bacteria from growing by interfering with their protein synthesis. It binds to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, thus inhibiting translation of mRNA. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. === Pharmacokinetics === Azithromycin is an acid-stable antibiotic, so it can be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed, but absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration (Tmax) in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to its high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma due to ion trapping and its high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single dose of 500 mg, the apparent terminal elimination half-life of azithromycin is 68 hours. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, about 6% of the administered dose appears as an unchanged drug in urine. == History == A team of researchers at the pharmaceutical company Pliva in Zagreb, Croatia discovered azithromycin in 1980. The company Pliva patented it in 1981. In 1986, Pliva and Pfizer signed a licensing agreement, which gave Pfizer exclusive rights for the sale of azithromycin in Western Europe and the United States. Pliva put its azithromycin on the market in Central and Eastern Europe. Pfizer launched azithromycin under Pliva's license in other markets under the brand name Zithromax in 1991. Patent protection ended in 2005. == Society and culture == === Available forms === Azithromycin is available as a generic medication. Azithromycin is administered in film-coated tablet, capsule, oral suspension, intravenous injection, granules for suspension in sachet, and ophthalmic solution. === Usage === In 2010, azithromycin was the most prescribed antibiotic for outpatients in the US, whereas in Sweden, where outpatient antibiotic use is a third as prevalent, macrolides are only on 3% of prescriptions. In 2017, and 2022, azithromycin was the second most prescribed antibiotic for outpatients in the United States. In 2022, it was the 78th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8 million prescriptions. === Brand names === == Research == Azithromycin is researched for its supposed anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, which are believed to be exhibited through its suppression of proinflammatory cytokines and enhancing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, which is important in dampening inflammation. Cytokines are small proteins that are secreted by immune cells and play a key role in the immune response. Studies suggest that azithromycin can decrease the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 while increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. By decreasing the number of pro-inflammatory cytokines, azithromycin probably controls potential tissue damage during inflammation. These effects are believed to be due to azithromycin's ability to suppress a transcription factor called nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) resulting in blockade of inflammatory response pathways downstream from NF-κB activation leading to decreased chemokine receptor CXCR4 signaling causing reduced inflammation. Despite the efficiency of treating rosacea with azithromycin, the exact mechanism of why azithromycin is effective in treating rosacea are not completely understood. It is unclear whether its antibacterial or immunomodulatory properties or a combination of both mechanisms contribute to its efficacy. Azithromycin may prevent mast cell degranulation and thus can suppress inflammation of dorsal root ganglia through various signaling pathways such as decreased numbers of CD4+ T cells which are particularly relevant since they mediate the response of hair follicle antigens. Inflammation in rosacea is thought to be associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by inflammatory cells. The ability of azithromycin to decrease ROS production can help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, but this remains speculation. The therapeutic role of azithromycin has been explored in various diseases such as cystic fibrosis exacerbation, burn injury-induced lung injury, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in COVID-19 infection. Despite early evidence showing azithromycin slowed down coronavirus multiplication in laboratory settings, further research indicates it to be ineffective as a treatment for COVID-19 in humans. Azithromycin in conjunction with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine has been associated with deleterious outcomes in COVID-19 patients, including drug-induced QT prolongation. After a large-scale trial showed no benefit of using azithromycin in treating COVID-19, the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) updated its guidance and no longer recommends the medication for COVID-19. Azithromycin has been studied in the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and has been reported to improve or even resolve symptoms in some cases. However, these studies have been described as being of very low quality. In any case, the beneficial effects might be by eradication of chronic bacterial infections that are possibly contributing to or causing CFS or by the immunomodulatory effects of azithromycin. Azithromycin therapy in cystic fibrosis patients yields a modest respiratory function improvement, reduces exacerbation risk, and extends time to exacerbation up to six months; still, long-term efficacy data is a subject of ongoing research. Potential benefits of azithromycin therapy is azithromycin's good safety profile, minimal treatment burden, and cost-effectiveness, but the drawbacks are gastrointestinal side effects with weekly dosing, which are ameliorated by a split dose regimen. The potential role of azithromycin in inhibiting the autophagic destruction of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) within macrophages has garnered significant attention. This mechanism may contribute to the observed correlation between long-term macrolide monotherapy and an increased risk of NTM infection and the emergence of macrolide-resistant strains. Azithromycin's interference with autophagy could potentially predispose patients with cystic fibrosis to mycobacterial infections. Despite repeated refutations of a direct association between azithromycin use and NTM infection, there remains a high level of concern regarding the potential for the development of NTM strains resistant to macrolides. Azithromycin has been shown to be an effective preventive measure against many postpartum infections in mothers following planned vaginal births; still, its impact on neonatal outcomes remains inconclusive and is the subject of ongoing research. == References == == See also == Zrinka Tamburašev, Croatian biochemist on the team that discovered azithromycin"	Azithromycin	WIKIPEDIA	('MEDICAL', [('MED', 0.0), ('ICAL', 0.0)])

N-(Deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-N-methyl-4-aminoazobenzene, previously characterized as the major adduct formed in this reaction, occurred as cis and trans isomers which were interconvertible and together accounted for 75% of the reaction of N-benzoyloxy-N-methyl-4-aminoazobenzene with [8-14C]deoxyadenosine. The products obtained by reaction of DNA with N-benzoyloxy-N-methyl-4-aminoazobenzene and subsequent digestion to deoxynucleosides had a profile similar to that of the products obtained from deoxyguanosine except that the DNA digest contained a second major product that was formed in only small amounts on reaction with deoxyguanosine. The latter product has been identified as 3-(deoxy-guanosin-N2-yl)-N-methyl-4--aminoazobenzene by Beland et. al. (Chem.-Biol. Interactions, in press). Reaction with [purine-14C]DNA showed that most, if not all, of the products were derived from purine nucleosides. Digests of the DNA from the livers of C57BL/6 X C3H/He F1 mice, given injections at 12 days of age with [prime ring-3H]N-methyl- or N,N-dimethyl-4-aminoazobenzene, contained the same major adducts as did those obtained from DNA reacted with N-benzoyloxy-N-methyl-4-aminoazobenzene. The hepatic DNA also yielded a series of minor products that comigrated on high-performance liquid chromatography with adducts obtained in the reactions with N-benzoyloxy-N-methyl-4-aminoazobenzene. Approximately 70 and 30%, respectively, of the N-(deoxyguanosin-8-yl)-N-methyl-4-aminoazobenzene and of the second major product were removed from the mouse liver DNA within 10 days after administration of [prime ring-3H]N,N-dimethyl-4-aminoazobenzene. These data are of interest in view of the development of multiple hepatic tumors in mice of this hybrid treated prior to weaning with N-methyl- or N,N-dimethyl-4-aminoazobenzene. Rate constants for guanine rotation about the Pt-N7 bond in (R,S,S,R)-Me(2)DABPtG(2) complexes (Me(2)DAB = N,N'-dimethyl-2,3-diaminobutane; G = 9-EtG, 3'-GMP, and 5'-GMP) were evaluated from line-shape analysis of H8 resonances. Three diastereomers, two in head-to-tail (DeltaHT and LambdaHT) and one in head-to-head (HH) conformations, exist in equilibrium in solution. The two guanines are equivalent in DeltaHT and LambdaHT conformers and nonequivalent in the HH form; therefore, four rate constants (k(Delta)(HT), k(Lambda)(HT), k(HH)()s, and k(HH)()d; sub-subscripts s and d stand for H8-shielded and -deshielded guanine, respectively) were evaluated. Activation parameters (DeltaH and DeltaS) were evaluated from the rate constant dependence on temperature. High values of DeltaH (78-93 kJ mol(-)(1)) and DeltaS (51-71 J K(-)(1) mol(-)(1)) were found for G rotation in the preferred DeltaHT rotamer having the six-membered ring of each guanine more canted toward the cis-G and a favorable dipole-dipole internucleotide interaction. Lower values of DeltaH() (64-76 kJ mol(-)(1)) and very small values of DeltaS() (-7-11 J K(-)(1) mol(-)(1)) were found for G rotation in the less favorable LambdaHT rotamer, indicating that the ground-state entropy of this rotamer is close to that of the activated complex and the ground-state enthalpy closer to that of the activated complex than for the DeltaHT rotamer. For the two guanines in the HH rotamer there is no large difference in activation parameters. In general DeltaH falls in the range 66-84 kJ mol(-)(1) (rather close to the values for the LambdaHT rotamer) and DeltaS in the range 14-41 J K(-)(1) mol(-)(1). The equilibrium constant between HT and HH rotamers was also evaluated together with the corresponding thermodynamic parameters (DeltaH and DeltaS). It is found that the low enthalpy is the major stabilizing factor for DeltaHT as compared to HH, while the entropy factor would favor the latter rotamer. In contrast the greater entropy is the stabilizing factor for the LambdaHT rotamer (the second most abundant conformer for 9-EtG and 3'-GMP) over the HH rotamer. In the latter case the enthalpy would favor the HH rotamer. In the case of the 5'-GMP derivative the greater entropy of the LambdaHT rotamer is not such to compensate for the lower enthalpy of the HH rotamer, and the latter remains the second most abundant rotamer. This investigation has allowed for the first time the enthalpic and entropic contributions favoring different rotamers to be distinguished.

12936.0	('Panthenol', 'Pantothenol', 'Pantothenyl alcohol', 'Panthenolum', 'Panthenol, racemic')	mouse	Panthenol (also called pantothenol) is the alcohol analog of pantothenic acid (vitamin B5), and is thus a provitamin of B5. In organisms, it is quickly oxidized to pantothenic acid. It is a viscous transparent liquid at room temperature. Panthenol is used in pharmaceutical and children's products as a moisturizer and to hasten wound healing. == Adverse effects == Panthenol is generally well tolerated. In rare cases, skin irritation and contact allergies have been reported. == Pharmacology == Panthenol readily penetrates into the skin and mucous membranes (including the intestinal mucosa), where it is quickly oxidized to pantothenic acid. Pantothenic acid is extremely hygroscopic. It is also used in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A, which plays a role in a wide range of enzymatic reactions and in cell growth. == Physical and chemical properties == Panthenol is an odourless, slightly bitter, highly viscous, transparent, and colourless liquid at room temperature, but salts of pantothenic acid (for example sodium pantothenate) are powders that are typically white. It is easily soluble in water and alcohol, moderately soluble in diethyl ether, soluble in chloroform (1:100), in propylene glycol, and slightly soluble in glycerin. Panthenol's expanded chemical formula is HO–CH2–C(CH3)2–CH(OH)–CONH–CH2CH2CH2–OH. === Stereochemistry === Panthenol comes in two enantiomers: D, and L. Only D-panthenol (dexpanthenol) is biologically active, however both forms have moisturizing properties. For cosmetic use, panthenol comes either in D form, or as a racemic mixture of D and L (DL-panthenol). == References ==	Panthenol	WIKIPEDIA	('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('MED', -0.35468587279319763), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -0.010536001063883305), (' CARE', 0.0)])

84384.0	('Progesterone', 'Pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione', 'Agolutin', 'Crinone', 'Prometrium')	mouse	"Progesterone ( ; P4) is an endogenous steroid and progestogen sex hormone involved in the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, and embryogenesis of humans and other species. It belongs to a group of steroid hormones called the progestogens and is the major progestogen in the body. Progesterone has a variety of important functions in the body. It is also a crucial metabolic intermediate in the production of other endogenous steroids, including the sex hormones and the corticosteroids, and plays an important role in brain function as a neurosteroid. In addition to its role as a natural hormone, progesterone is also used as a medication, such as in combination with estrogen for contraception, to reduce the risk of uterine or cervical cancer, in hormone replacement therapy, and in feminizing hormone therapy. It was first prescribed in 1934. == Biological activity == Progesterone is the most important progestogen in the body. As a potent agonist of the nuclear progesterone receptor (nPR) (with an affinity of KD = 1 nM) the resulting effects on ribosomal transcription plays a major role in regulation of female reproduction. In addition, progesterone is an agonist of the more recently discovered membrane progesterone receptors (mPRs), of which the expression has regulation effects in reproduction function (oocyte maturation, labor, and sperm motility) and cancer although additional research is required to further define the roles. It also functions as a ligand of the PGRMC1 (progesterone receptor membrane component 1) which impacts tumor progression, metabolic regulation, and viability control of nerve cells. Moreover, progesterone is also known to be an antagonist of the sigma σ1 receptor, a negative allosteric modulator of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and a potent antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR). Progesterone prevents MR activation by binding to this receptor with an affinity exceeding even those of aldosterone and glucocorticoids such as cortisol and corticosterone, and produces antimineralocorticoid effects, such as natriuresis, at physiological concentrations. In addition, progesterone binds to and behaves as a partial agonist of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), albeit with very low potency (EC50 >100-fold less relative to cortisol). Progesterone, through its neurosteroid active metabolites such as 5α-dihydroprogesterone and allopregnanolone, acts indirectly as a positive allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor. Progesterone and some of its metabolites, such as 5β-dihydroprogesterone, are agonists of the pregnane X receptor (PXR), albeit weakly so (EC50 >10 μM). In accordance, progesterone induces several hepatic cytochrome P450 enzymes, such as CYP3A4, especially during pregnancy when concentrations are much higher than usual. Perimenopausal women have been found to have greater CYP3A4 activity relative to men and postmenopausal women, and it has been inferred that this may be due to the higher progesterone levels present in perimenopausal women. Progesterone modulates the activity of CatSper (cation channels of sperm) voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Since eggs release progesterone, sperm may use progesterone as a homing signal to swim toward eggs (chemotaxis). As a result, it has been suggested that substances that block the progesterone binding site on CatSper channels could potentially be used in male contraception. == Biological function == === Hormonal interactions === Progesterone has a number of physiological effects that are amplified in the presence of estrogens. Estrogens through estrogen receptors (ERs) induce or upregulate the expression of the PR. One example of this is in breast tissue, where estrogens allow progesterone to mediate lobuloalveolar development. Elevated levels of progesterone potently reduce the sodium-retaining activity of aldosterone, resulting in natriuresis and a reduction in extracellular fluid volume. Progesterone withdrawal, on the other hand, is associated with a temporary increase in sodium retention (reduced natriuresis, with an increase in extracellular fluid volume) due to the compensatory increase in aldosterone production, which combats the blockade of the mineralocorticoid receptor by the previously elevated level of progesterone. === Early sexual differentiation === Progesterone plays a role in early human sexual differentiation. Placental progesterone is the feedstock for the 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT) produced via the backdoor pathway found operating in multiple non-gonadal tissues of the fetus, whereas deficiencies in this pathway lead to undervirilization of the male fetus, resulting in incomplete development of the male genitalia. DHT is a potent androgen that is responsible for the development of male genitalia, including the penis and scrotum. During early fetal development, the undifferentiated gonads can develop into either testes or ovaries. The presence of the Y chromosome leads to the development of testes. The testes then produce testosterone, which is converted to DHT via the enzyme 5α-reductase. DHT is a potent androgen that is responsible for the masculinization of the external genitalia and the development of the prostate gland. Progesterone, produced by the placenta during pregnancy, plays a role in fetal sexual differentiation by serving as a precursor molecule for the synthesis of DHT via the backdoor pathway. In the absence of adequate levels of steroidogenic enzymes during fetal development, the backdoor pathway for DHT synthesis can become deficient, leading to undermasculinization of the male fetus. This can result in the development of ambiguous genitalia or even female genitalia in some cases. Therefore, both DHT and progesterone play crucial roles in early fetal sexual differentiation, with progesterone acting as a precursor molecule for DHT synthesis and DHT promoting the development of male genitalia. === Reproductive system === Progesterone has key effects via non-genomic signalling on human sperm as they migrate through the female reproductive tract before fertilization occurs, though the receptor(s) as yet remain unidentified. Detailed characterisation of the events occurring in sperm in response to progesterone has elucidated certain events including intracellular calcium transients and maintained changes, slow calcium oscillations, now thought to possibly regulate motility. It is produced by the ovaries. Progesterone has also been shown to demonstrate effects on octopus spermatozoa. Progesterone is sometimes called the ""hormone of pregnancy"", and it has many roles relating to the development of the fetus: Progesterone converts the endometrium to its secretory stage to prepare the uterus for implantation. At the same time progesterone affects the vaginal epithelium and cervical mucus, making it thick and impenetrable to sperm. Progesterone is anti-mitogenic in endometrial epithelial cells, and as such, mitigates the tropic effects of estrogen. If pregnancy does not occur, progesterone levels will decrease, leading to menstruation. Normal menstrual bleeding is progesterone-withdrawal bleeding. If ovulation does not occur and the corpus luteum does not develop, levels of progesterone may be low, leading to anovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding. During implantation and gestation, progesterone appears to decrease the maternal immune response to allow for the acceptance of the pregnancy. Progesterone decreases contractility of the uterine smooth muscle. This effect contributes to prevention of preterm labor. Studies have shown that in individuals who are pregnant with a single fetus, asymptomatic in the prenatal stage, and at a high risk of giving pre-term birth spontaneously, vaginal progesterone medication has been found to be effective in preventing spontaneous pre-term birth. Individuals who are at a high risk of giving pre-term birth spontaneously are those who have a short cervix of less than 25 mm or have previously given pre-term birth spontaneously. Although pre-term births are generally considered to be less than 37 weeks, these studies found that vaginal progesterone is associated with fewer pre-term births of less than 34 weeks. A drop in progesterone levels is possibly one step that facilitates the onset of labor. In addition, progesterone inhibits lactation during pregnancy. The fall in progesterone levels following delivery is one of the triggers for milk production. The fetus metabolizes placental progesterone in the production of adrenal steroids. === Breasts === ==== Lobuloalveolar development ==== Progesterone plays an important role in breast development. In conjunction with prolactin, it mediates lobuloalveolar maturation of the mammary glands during pregnancy to allow for milk production and thus lactation and breastfeeding of offspring following parturition (childbirth). Estrogen induces expression of the PR in breast tissue and hence progesterone is dependent on estrogen to mediate lobuloalveolar development. It has been found that RANKLTooltip Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand is a critical downstream mediator of progesterone-induced lobuloalveolar maturation. RANKL knockout mice show an almost identical mammary phenotype to PR knockout mice, including normal mammary ductal development but complete failure of the development of lobuloalveolar structures. ==== Ductal development ==== Though to a far lesser extent than estrogen, which is the major mediator of mammary ductal development (via the ERα), progesterone may be involved in ductal development of the mammary glands to some extent as well. PR knockout mice or mice treated with the PR antagonist mifepristone show delayed although otherwise normal mammary ductal development at puberty. In addition, mice modified to have overexpression of PRA display ductal hyperplasia, and progesterone induces ductal growth in the mouse mammary gland. Progesterone mediates ductal development mainly via induction of the expression of amphiregulin, the same growth factor that estrogen primarily induces the expression of to mediate ductal development. These animal findings suggest that, while not essential for full mammary ductal development, progesterone seems to play a potentiating or accelerating role in estrogen-mediated mammary ductal development. ==== Breast cancer risk ==== Progesterone also appears to be involved in the pathophysiology of breast cancer, though its role, and whether it is a promoter or inhibitor of breast cancer risk, has not been fully elucidated. Most progestins, or synthetic progestogens, like medroxyprogesterone acetate, have been found to increase the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal people in combination with estrogen as a component of menopausal hormone therapy. The combination of natural oral progesterone or the atypical progestin dydrogesterone with estrogen has been associated with less risk of breast cancer than progestins plus estrogen. However, this may simply be an artifact of the low progesterone levels produced with oral progesterone. More research is needed on the role of progesterone in breast cancer. === Skin health === The estrogen receptor, as well as the progesterone receptor, have been detected in the skin, including in keratinocytes and fibroblasts. At menopause and thereafter, decreased levels of female sex hormones result in atrophy, thinning, and increased wrinkling of the skin and a reduction in skin elasticity, firmness, and strength. These skin changes constitute an acceleration in skin aging and are the result of decreased collagen content, irregularities in the morphology of epidermal skin cells, decreased ground substance between skin fibers, and reduced capillaries and blood flow. The skin also becomes more dry during menopause, which is due to reduced skin hydration and surface lipids (sebum production). Along with chronological aging and photoaging, estrogen deficiency in menopause is one of the three main factors that predominantly influences skin aging. Hormone replacement therapy, consisting of systemic treatment with estrogen alone or in combination with a progestogen, has well-documented and considerable beneficial effects on the skin of postmenopausal people. These benefits include increased skin collagen content, skin thickness and elasticity, and skin hydration and surface lipids. Topical estrogen has been found to have similar beneficial effects on the skin. In addition, a study has found that topical 2% progesterone cream significantly increases skin elasticity and firmness and observably decreases wrinkles in peri- and postmenopausal people. Skin hydration and surface lipids, on the other hand, did not significantly change with topical progesterone. These findings suggest that progesterone, like estrogen, also has beneficial effects on the skin, and may be independently protective against skin aging. === Sexuality === ==== Libido ==== Progesterone and its neurosteroid active metabolite allopregnanolone appear to be importantly involved in libido in females. ==== Homosexuality ==== Dr. Diana Fleischman, of the University of Portsmouth, and colleagues looked for a relationship between progesterone and sexual attitudes in 92 women. Their research, published in the Archives of Sexual Behavior found that women who had higher levels of progesterone scored higher on a questionnaire measuring homoerotic motivation. They also found that men who had high levels of progesterone were more likely to have higher homoerotic motivation scores after affiliative priming compared to men with low levels of progesterone. === Nervous system === Progesterone, like pregnenolone and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), belongs to an important group of endogenous steroids called neurosteroids. It can be metabolized within all parts of the central nervous system. Neurosteroids are neuromodulators, and are neuroprotective, neurogenic, and regulate neurotransmission and myelination. The effects of progesterone as a neurosteroid are mediated predominantly through its interactions with non-nuclear PRs, namely the mPRs and PGRMC1, as well as certain other receptors, such as the σ1 and nACh receptors. === Brain damage === Previous studies have shown that progesterone supports the normal development of neurons in the brain, and that the hormone has a protective effect on damaged brain tissue. It has been observed in animal models that females have reduced susceptibility to traumatic brain injury and this protective effect has been hypothesized to be caused by increased circulating levels of estrogen and progesterone in females. ==== Proposed mechanism ==== The mechanism of progesterone protective effects may be the reduction of inflammation that follows brain trauma and hemorrhage. Damage incurred by traumatic brain injury is believed to be caused in part by mass depolarization leading to excitotoxicity. One way in which progesterone helps to alleviate some of this excitotoxicity is by blocking the voltage-dependent calcium channels that trigger neurotransmitter release. It does so by manipulating the signaling pathways of transcription factors involved in this release. Another method for reducing the excitotoxicity is by up-regulating the GABAA, a widespread inhibitory neurotransmitter receptor. Progesterone has also been shown to prevent apoptosis in neurons, a common consequence of brain injury. It does so by inhibiting enzymes involved in the apoptosis pathway specifically concerning the mitochondria, such as activated caspase 3 and cytochrome c. Not only does progesterone help prevent further damage, it has also been shown to aid in neuroregeneration. One of the serious effects of traumatic brain injury includes edema. Animal studies show that progesterone treatment leads to a decrease in edema levels by increasing the concentration of macrophages and microglia sent to the injured tissue. This was observed in the form of reduced leakage from the blood brain barrier in secondary recovery in progesterone treated rats. In addition, progesterone was observed to have antioxidant properties, reducing the concentration of oxygen free radicals faster than without. There is also evidence that the addition of progesterone can also help remyelinate damaged axons due to trauma, restoring some lost neural signal conduction. Another way progesterone aids in regeneration includes increasing the circulation of endothelial progenitor cells in the brain. This helps new vasculature to grow around scar tissue which helps repair the area of insult. === Addiction === Progesterone enhances the function of serotonin receptors in the brain, so an excess or deficit of progesterone has the potential to result in significant neurochemical issues. This provides an explanation for why some people resort to substances that enhance serotonin activity such as nicotine, alcohol, and cannabis when their progesterone levels fall below optimal levels. Sex differences in hormone levels may induce women to respond differently than men to nicotine. When women undergo cyclic changes or different hormonal transition phases (menopause, pregnancy, adolescence), there are changes in their progesterone levels. Therefore, females have an increased biological vulnerability to nicotine's reinforcing effects compared to males and progesterone may be used to counter this enhanced vulnerability. This information supports the idea that progesterone can affect behavior. Similar to nicotine, cocaine also increases the release of dopamine in the brain. The neurotransmitter is involved in the reward center and is one of the main neurotransmitters involved with substance abuse and reliance. In a study of cocaine users, it was reported that progesterone reduced craving and the feeling of being stimulated by cocaine. Thus, progesterone was suggested as an agent that decreases cocaine craving by reducing the dopaminergic properties of the drug. === Societal === In a 2012 University of Amsterdam study of 120 women, women's luteal phase (higher levels of progesterone, and increasing levels of estrogen) was correlated with a lower level of competitive behavior in gambling and math contest scenarios, while their premenstrual phase (sharply-decreasing levels of progesterone, and decreasing levels of estrogen) was correlated with a higher level of competitive behavior. === Other effects === Progesterone also has a role in skin elasticity and bone strength, in respiration, in nerve tissue and in female sexuality, and the presence of progesterone receptors in certain muscle and fat tissue may hint at a role in sexually dimorphic proportions of those. During pregnancy, progesterone is said to decrease uterine irritability. During pregnancy, progesterone helps to suppress immune responses of the mother to fetal antigens, which prevents rejection of the fetus. Progesterone raises epidermal growth factor-1 (EGF-1) levels, a factor often used to induce proliferation, and used to sustain cultures, of stem cells. Progesterone increases core temperature (thermogenic function) during ovulation. Progesterone reduces spasm and relaxes smooth muscle. Bronchi are widened and mucus regulated. (PRs are widely present in submucosal tissue.) Progesterone acts as an antiinflammatory agent and regulates the immune response. Progesterone reduces gall-bladder activity. Progesterone normalizes blood clotting and vascular tone, zinc and copper levels, cell oxygen levels, and use of fat stores for energy. Progesterone may affect gum health, increasing risk of gingivitis (gum inflammation). Progesterone appears to prevent endometrial cancer (involving the uterine lining) by regulating the effects of estrogen. Progesterone plays an important role in the signaling of insulin release and pancreatic function, and may affect the susceptibility to diabetes or gestational diabetes. Progesterone levels in the blood were found to be lower in those who had higher weight and higher BMI among those who became pregnant through in vitro fertilization. Current data shows that micronized progesterone, which is chemically identical to the progesterone produced in people's bodies, in combination with estrogen in menopausal hormone therapy does not seem to have significant effects on venous thromboembolism (blood clots in veins) and ischemic stroke (lack of blood flow to the brain due to blockage of a blood vessel that supplies the brain). However, more studies need to be conducted to see whether or not micronized progesterone alone or in combined menopausal hormone therapy changes the risk of myocardial infarctions (heart attacks). There have not been any studies done yet on the effects of micronized progesterone on hair loss due to menopause. Despite suggestions for using hormone therapy to prevent loss of muscle mass in post-menopausal individuals (50 and older), menopausal hormone therapy involving either estrogen alone or estrogen and progesterone has not been found to preserve muscle mass. Menopausal hormone therapy also does not result in body weight reduction, BMI reduction, or change in glucose metabolism. == Biochemistry == === Biosynthesis === In mammals, progesterone, like all other steroid hormones, is synthesized from pregnenolone, which itself is derived from cholesterol. Cholesterol undergoes double oxidation to produce 22R-hydroxycholesterol and then 20α,22R-dihydroxycholesterol. This vicinal diol is then further oxidized with loss of the side chain starting at position C22 to produce pregnenolone. This reaction is catalyzed by cytochrome P450scc. The conversion of pregnenolone to progesterone takes place in two steps. First, the 3β-hydroxyl group is oxidized to a keto group and second, the double bond is moved to C4, from C5 through a keto/enol tautomerization reaction. This reaction is catalyzed by 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/δ5-4-isomerase. Progesterone in turn is the precursor of the mineralocorticoid aldosterone, and after conversion to 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, of cortisol and androstenedione. Androstenedione can be converted to testosterone, estrone, and estradiol, highlighting the critical role of progesterone in testosterone synthesis. Pregnenolone and progesterone can also be synthesized by yeast. Approximately 25 mg of progesterone is secreted from the ovaries per day, while the adrenal glands produce about 2 mg of progesterone per day. === Distribution === Progesterone binds extensively to plasma proteins, including albumin (50–54%) and transcortin (43–48%). It has similar affinity for albumin relative to the PR. === Metabolism === The metabolism of progesterone is rapid and extensive and occurs mainly in the liver, though enzymes that metabolize progesterone are also expressed widely in the brain, skin, and various other extrahepatic tissues. Progesterone has an elimination half-life of only approximately 5 minutes in circulation. The metabolism of progesterone is complex, and it may form as many as 35 different unconjugated metabolites when it is ingested orally. Progesterone is highly susceptible to enzymatic reduction via reductases and hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases due to its double bond (between the C4 and C5 positions) and its two ketones (at the C3 and C20 positions). The major metabolic pathway of progesterone is reduction by 5α-reductase and 5β-reductase into the dihydrogenated 5α-dihydroprogesterone and 5β-dihydroprogesterone, respectively. This is followed by the further reduction of these metabolites via 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase into the tetrahydrogenated allopregnanolone, pregnanolone, isopregnanolone, and epipregnanolone. Subsequently, 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 20β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase reduce these metabolites to form the corresponding hexahydrogenated pregnanediols (eight different isomers in total), which are then conjugated via glucuronidation and/or sulfation, released from the liver into circulation, and excreted by the kidneys into the urine. The major metabolite of progesterone in the urine is the 3α,5β,20α isomer of pregnanediol glucuronide, which has been found to constitute 15 to 30% of an injection of progesterone. Other metabolites of progesterone formed by the enzymes in this pathway include 3α-dihydroprogesterone, 3β-dihydroprogesterone, 20α-dihydroprogesterone, and 20β-dihydroprogesterone, as well as various combination products of the enzymes aside from those already mentioned. Progesterone can also first be hydroxylated (see below) and then reduced. Endogenous progesterone is metabolized approximately 50% into 5α-dihydroprogesterone in the corpus luteum, 35% into 3β-dihydroprogesterone in the liver, and 10% into 20α-dihydroprogesterone. Relatively small portions of progesterone are hydroxylated via 17α-hydroxylase (CYP17A1) and 21-hydroxylase (CYP21A2) into 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone (21-hydroxyprogesterone), respectively, and pregnanetriols are formed secondarily to 17α-hydroxylation. Even smaller amounts of progesterone may be also hydroxylated via 11β-hydroxylase (CYP11B1) and to a lesser extent via aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) into 11β-hydroxyprogesterone. In addition, progesterone can be hydroxylated in the liver by other cytochrome P450 enzymes which are not steroid-specific. 6β-Hydroxylation, which is catalyzed mainly by CYP3A4, is the major transformation, and is responsible for approximately 70% of cytochrome P450-mediated progesterone metabolism. Other routes include 6α-, 16α-, and 16β-hydroxylation. However, treatment of women with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor, had minimal effects on progesterone levels, producing only a slight and non-significant increase, and this suggests that cytochrome P450 enzymes play only a small role in progesterone metabolism. === Levels === Progesterone levels are relatively low during the preovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle, rise after ovulation, and are elevated during the luteal phase, as shown in the diagram above. Progesterone levels tend to be less than 2 ng/mL prior to ovulation and greater than 5 ng/mL after ovulation. If pregnancy occurs, human chorionic gonadotropin is released, maintaining the corpus luteum and allowing it to maintain levels of progesterone. Between 7 and 9 weeks, the placenta begins to produce progesterone in place of the corpus luteum in a process called the luteal-placental shift. After the luteal-placental shift, progesterone levels start to rise further and may reach 100 to 200 ng/mL at term. Whether a decrease in progesterone levels is critical for the initiation of labor has been argued and may be species-specific. After delivery of the placenta and during lactation, progesterone levels are very low. Progesterone levels are low in children and postmenopausal people. Adult males have levels similar to those in women during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle. ==== Ranges ==== Blood test results should always be interpreted using the reference ranges provided by the laboratory that performed the results. Example reference ranges are listed below. === Sources === ==== Animal ==== Progesterone is produced in high amounts in the ovaries (by the corpus luteum) from the onset of puberty to menopause, and is also produced in smaller amounts by the adrenal glands after the onset of adrenarche in both males and females. To a lesser extent, progesterone is produced in nervous tissue, especially in the brain, and in adipose (fat) tissue, as well. During human pregnancy, progesterone is produced in increasingly high amounts by the ovaries and placenta. At first, the source is the corpus luteum that has been ""rescued"" by the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) from the conceptus. However, after the 8th week, production of progesterone shifts to the placenta. The placenta utilizes maternal cholesterol as the initial substrate, and most of the produced progesterone enters the maternal circulation, but some is picked up by the fetal circulation and used as substrate for fetal corticosteroids. At term the placenta produces about 250 mg progesterone per day. An additional animal source of progesterone is milk products. After consumption of milk products the level of bioavailable progesterone goes up. ==== Plants ==== In at least one plant, Juglans regia, progesterone has been detected. In addition, progesterone-like steroids are found in Dioscorea mexicana. Dioscorea mexicana is a plant that is part of the yam family native to Mexico. It contains a steroid called diosgenin that is taken from the plant and is converted into progesterone. Diosgenin and progesterone are also found in other Dioscorea species, as well as in other plants that are not closely related, such as fenugreek. Another plant that contains substances readily convertible to progesterone is Dioscorea pseudojaponica native to Taiwan. Research has shown that the Taiwanese yam contains saponins — steroids that can be converted to diosgenin and thence to progesterone. Many other Dioscorea species of the yam family contain steroidal substances from which progesterone can be produced. Among the more notable of these are Dioscorea villosa and Dioscorea polygonoides. One study showed that the Dioscorea villosa contains 3.5% diosgenin. Dioscorea polygonoides has been found to contain 2.64% diosgenin as shown by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Many of the Dioscorea species that originate from the yam family grow in countries that have tropical and subtropical climates. == Medical use == Progesterone is used as a medication. It is used in combination with estrogens mainly in hormone therapy for menopausal symptoms and low sex hormone levels. It may also be used alone to treat menopausal symptoms. Studies have shown that transdermal progesterone (skin patch) and oral micronized progesterone are effective treatments for certain symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes and night sweats, which are otherwise referred to as vasomotor symptoms or VMS. It is also used to support pregnancy and fertility and to treat gynecological disorders. Progesterone has been shown to prevent miscarriage in those with 1) vaginal bleeding early in their current pregnancy and 2) a previous history of miscarriage. Progesterone can be taken by mouth, through the vagina, and by injection into muscle or fat, among other routes. == Chemistry == Progesterone is a naturally occurring pregnane steroid and is also known as pregn-4-ene-3,20-dione. It has a double bond (4-ene) between the C4 and C5 positions and two ketone groups (3,20-dione), one at the C3 position and the other at the C20 position. === Synthesis === Progesterone is commercially produced by semisynthesis. Two main routes are used: one from yam diosgenin first pioneered by Marker in 1940, and one based on soy phytosterols scaled up in the 1970s. Additional (not necessarily economical) semisyntheses of progesterone have also been reported starting from a variety of steroids. For the example, cortisone can be simultaneously deoxygenated at the C-17 and C-21 position by treatment with iodotrimethylsilane in chloroform to produce 11-keto-progesterone (ketogestin), which in turn can be reduced at position-11 to yield progesterone. ==== Marker semisynthesis ==== An economical semisynthesis of progesterone from the plant steroid diosgenin isolated from yams was developed by Russell Marker in 1940 for the Parke-Davis pharmaceutical company. This synthesis is known as the Marker degradation. The 16-DPA intermediate is important to the synthesis of many other medically important steroids. A very similar approach can produce 16-DPA from solanine. ==== Soy semisynthesis ==== Progesterone can also be made from the stigmasterol found in soybean oil also. c.f. Percy Julian. ==== Total synthesis ==== A total synthesis of progesterone was reported in 1971 by W.S. Johnson. The synthesis begins with reacting the phosphonium salt 7 with phenyl lithium to produce the phosphonium ylide 8. The ylide 8 is reacted with an aldehyde to produce the alkene 9. The ketal protecting groups of 9 are hydrolyzed to produce the diketone 10, which in turn is cyclized to form the cyclopentenone 11. The ketone of 11 is reacted with methyl lithium to yield the tertiary alcohol 12, which in turn is treated with acid to produce the tertiary cation 13. The key step of the synthesis is the π-cation cyclization of 13 in which the B-, C-, and D-rings of the steroid are simultaneously formed to produce 14. This step resembles the cationic cyclization reaction used in the biosynthesis of steroids and hence is referred to as biomimetic. In the next step the enol orthoester is hydrolyzed to produce the ketone 15. The cyclopentene A-ring is then opened by oxidizing with ozone to produce 16. Finally, the diketone 17 undergoes an intramolecular aldol condensation by treating with aqueous potassium hydroxide to produce progesterone. == History == George W. Corner and Willard M. Allen discovered the hormonal action of progesterone in 1929. By 1931–1932, nearly pure crystalline material of high progestational activity had been isolated from the corpus luteum of animals, and by 1934, pure crystalline progesterone had been refined and obtained and the chemical structure of progesterone was determined. This was achieved by Adolf Butenandt at the Chemisches Institut of Technical University in Danzig, who extracted this new compound from several thousand liters of urine. Chemical synthesis of progesterone from stigmasterol and pregnanediol was accomplished later that year. Up to this point, progesterone, known generically as corpus luteum hormone, had been being referred to by several groups by different names, including corporin, lutein, luteosterone, and progestin. In 1935, at the time of the Second International Conference on the Standardization of Sex Hormones in London, England, a compromise was made between the groups and the name progesterone (progestational steroidal ketone) was created. === Veterinary use === The use of progesterone tests in dog breeding to pinpoint ovulation is becoming more widely used. There are several tests available but the most reliable test is a blood test with blood drawn by a veterinarian and sent to a lab for processing. Results can usually be obtained with 24 to 72 hours. The rationale for using progesterone tests is that increased numbers begin in close proximity to preovulatory surge in gonadotrophins and continue through ovulation and estrus. When progesterone levels reach certain levels they can signal the stage of estrus the female is. Prediction of birth date of the pending litter can be very accurate if ovulation date is known. Puppies deliver with a day or two of 9 weeks gestation in most cases. It is not possible to determine pregnancy using progesterone tests once a breeding has taken place, however. This is due to the fact that, in dogs, progesterone levels remain elevated throughout the estrus period. === Pricing === Pricing for progesterone can vary depending location, insurance coverage, discount coupons, quantity, shortages, manufacturers, brand or generic versions, different pharmacies, and so on. As of currently, 30 capsules of 100 mg of the generic version, Prometrium, from CVS Pharmacy is around $40 without any discounts or insurance applied. The brand version, Progesterone, is around $450 for 30 capsules without any discounts or insurance applied. In comparison, Walgreens offers 30 capsules of 100 mg in the generic version for $51 without insurance or coupons applied. The brand name costs around $431 for 30 capsules of 100 mg. == References == This article incorporates text available under the CC BY-SA 3.0 license. == External links == Progesterone MS Spectrum Progesterone at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) Kimball JW (27 May 2007).

The long-term fermentation endows dry-cured hams with a unique flavor and quality. Our previous study has identified Asp-Leu-Glu-Glu (DLEE) from dry-cured Xuanwei ham with remarkable antioxidant capacity. In the current study, the Caco-2 cells were cultured in vitro and treated with different doses of DLEE. The cellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) level and antioxidant enzyme activities were then determined to investigate the intracellular protection effect of DLEE. According to the results, the cellular ROS level was reduced, whereas the antioxidant enzyme activities of glutathione reductase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase were improved following DLEE treatment. The DLEE treatment also increased the Nrf2 expression, along with downregulating the Keap1 expression. Thus, the dry-cured ham-derived peptide DLEE exhibited excellent bioactive capacity by reducing the ROS level and regulating the antioxidant enzyme activities. In addition, Nrf2/Keap1 was shown to be the main signaling pathway underlying DLEE-induced antioxidant activities in Caco-2 cells. The hexapeptide ALA-ASP-LEU-LYS-PRO-THR is currently widely used as an active ingredient in commercially available creams. Therefore, the proper analytical procedure to detect this compound is a very important issue.

90958.0	('12(13)-epoxy-9z-octadecenoic acid', '(z)-11-(3-pentyloxiran-2-yl)undec-9-enoic acid', '(9z)-12,13-epoxyoctadecenoic acid', 'Leukotoxin b (12,13-eode)', 'Isoleukotoxin')	mouse	Coronaric acid (leukotoxin or leukotoxin A) is a mono-unsaturated, epoxide derivative of the di-unsaturated fatty acid, linoleic acid (i.e. 9(Z),12(Z) octadecadienoic acid). It is a mixture of the two optically active isomers of 12(Z) 9,10-epoxy-octadecenoic acid. This mixture is also termed 9,10-epoxy-12Z-octadecenoic acid or 9(10)-EpOME (for Epoxy-Octadeca-MonoEnoic acid) and when formed by or studied in mammalians, leukotoxin. == Occurrence == Coronaric acid is found in the seed oils derived from plants in the sunflower family, such as Helianthus annuus and Xeranthemum annuum. Coronaric acid is also formed by the cells and tissues of various mammalian (including human) species through the metabolism of linoleic acid by cytochrome P450 (CYP) epoxygenase enzymes. These CYPs (CYP2C9 and probably other CYPs that metabolize polyunsaturated fatty acids to epoxides) metabolize linoleic acid to 9S,10R-epoxy-12(Z)-octadecenoic acid and 9R,10S-epoxy-12(Z)-octadecenoic acid, i.e. the (+) and (-) epoxy optical isomers of coronaric acid. When studied in this context, the optical isomer mixture is often termed leukotoxin. These same CYP epoxygenases concurrently attack linoleic acid at the carbon 12,13 rather than 9,10 double bond of linoleic acid to form a mixture of (+) and (-) epoxy optical isomers viz., 12S,13R-epoxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic and 12R,13S-epoxy-9(Z)-octadecenoic acids. This (+) and (-) optical mixture is often termed vernolic acid when studied in plants and isoleukotoxin when studied in mammals. Coronaric acid is found in urine samples from healthy human subjects and increases 3- to 4-fold when these subjects are treated with a salt-loading diet. Coronaric and vernolic acids also form non-enzymatically when linoleic acid is exposed to oxygen and/or UV radiation as a result of the spontaneous process of autoxidation. This autoxidation complicates studies in that it is often difficult to determine if these epoxy fatty acids identified in linoleic acid-rich plant and mammalian tissues represent actual tissue contents or are artifacts formed during their isolation and detection. == Metabolism == In mammalian tissue, coronaric acid is metabolized to its two corresponding dihydroxy stereoisomers, 9S,10R-dihydroxy-12(Z)-octadecenoic and 9R,10S-dihydroxy-12(Z)-octadecenoic acids, by soluble epoxide hydrolase within minutes of its formation. The metabolism of coronaric acid to these two products, collectively termed leukotoxin diols, appears to be critical to coronaric acid's toxicity, i.e. the diols are the toxic metabolites of the non-toxic or far less toxic coronaric acid. == Activities == === Toxicities === At very high concentrations, the linoleic acid-derived set of optical isomers, coronaric acid (i.e. leukotoxin) possesses toxicity similar to that of other structurally unrelated leukotoxins. It is toxic to leukocytes and other cell types, and when injected into rodents produces multiple organ failure and respiratory distress. These effects appear to be due to its conversion to its dihydroxy counterparts, 9S,10R- and 9R,10S-dihydroxy-12(Z)-octadecenoic acids by soluble epoxide hydrolase. Some studies suggest, but have not yet proven, that isoleukotoxin, acting primarily if not exclusively through its dihydroxy counterparts, is responsible for or contributes to multiple organ failure, the acute respiratory distress syndrome, and certain other cataclysmic diseases in humans (see Epoxygenase § Linoleic acid). Vernolic acid (i.e. isoleukotoxin) shares a similar metabolic fate in being converted by soluble epoxide hydrolase to its dihydroxide counterparts, resulting in the toxic actions of those counterparts. === Other activities === At lower concentrations, isoleukotoxin and its dihydroxy counterparts can protect from the toxic actions cited above that occur at higher concentrations of isoleukotoxin and leukotoxin; they may also share with the epoxides of arachidonic acid, i.e. the epoxyeicosatreienoates (see Epoxyeicosatrienoic acids), anti-hypertension activities. == References ==	Isoleukotoxin	WIKIPEDIA	('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.006338976323604584), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.4974866644479334e-05), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.018157554790377617), (' FOOD', -1.747814349073451e-05)])

The tripeptide was quantitated using a competitive radioimmunoassay in which 125I-labeled thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), is displaced from antibody specific to TRH (pyroGlu-His-Pro amide). The pyroGlu-Tyr-Pro amide was purified by passing the filtered extract through QAE-Sephadex A25 at pH 5, followed by open bed chromatography on C18 silica using an H2O/methanol gradient, then preparative high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on microbondapak C18 using a 10 mM HCl/methanol gradient, followed by G-10-Sephadex chromatography, SP-C25-Sephadex chromatography, QAE-Sephadex chromatography at pH 10.1, analytical HPLC on a microbondapak C18 column eluted with 10 mm HCl/acetonitrile, and analytical HPLC reverse phase chromatography on an APEX phenyl column eluted with H2O/acetonitrile. The tripeptide was essentially homogeneous after the final chromatography step, as judged by correspondence of immunoreactivity with A280. The sequence of the alfalfa tripeptide was determined to be Glu-Tyr-Pro by gas phase sequencing, after hydrolysis of pyroglutamic acid by mild acid hydrolysis. The mass of the alfalfa tripeptide was 389.1, as determined by fast ion bombardment mass spectroscopy, and was found to be identical to the mass of synthetic pyroGlu-Tyr-Pro amide.

40172.0	('Hydroquinone', 'Benzene-1,4-diol', 'Quinol', 'P-benzenediol', 'P-hydroquinone')	mouse	"Hydroquinone, also known as benzene-1,4-diol or quinol, is an aromatic organic compound that is a type of phenol, a derivative of benzene, having the chemical formula C6H4(OH)2. It has two hydroxyl groups bonded to a benzene ring in a para position. It is a white granular solid. Substituted derivatives of this parent compound are also referred to as hydroquinones. The name ""hydroquinone"" was coined by Friedrich Wöhler in 1843. In 2022, it was the 268th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 900,000 prescriptions. == Production == Hydroquinone is produced industrially in two main ways. The most widely used route is similar to the cumene process in reaction mechanism and involves the dialkylation of benzene with propene to give 1,4-diisopropylbenzene. This compound reacts with air to afford the bis(hydroperoxide), which is structurally similar to cumene hydroperoxide and rearranges in acid to give acetone and hydroquinone. A second route involves hydroxylation of phenol over a catalyst. The conversion uses hydrogen peroxide and affords a mixture of hydroquinone and its ortho isomer catechol (benzene-1,2-diol): C6H5OH + H2O2 → C6H4(OH)2 + H2O Other, less common methods include: A potentially significant synthesis of hydroquinone from acetylene and iron pentacarbonyl has been proposed. Iron pentacarbonyl serves as a catalyst, rather than as a reagent, in the presence of free carbon monoxide gas. Rhodium or ruthenium can substitute for iron as the catalyst with favorable chemical yields but are not typically used due to their cost of recovery from the reaction mixture. Hydroquinone and its derivatives can also be prepared by oxidation of various phenols, such as aniline and DIPB. Examples include Elbs persulfate oxidation and Dakin oxidation. Hydroquinone was first obtained in 1820 by the French chemists Pelletier and Caventou via the dry distillation of quinic acid. Hydrolysis of chlorophenol. The latter three methods are generally less atom-economical than oxidation with hydrogen peroxide, and their commercial practice in China produced serious pollution in 2022. == Reactions == The reactivity of hydroquinone's hydroxyl groups resembles that of other phenols, being weakly acidic. The resulting conjugate base easily undergoes O-alkylation to give mono- and diethers. Similarly, hydroquinone is highly susceptible to ring substitution via Friedel–Crafts alkylation. This reaction is often used for the production of several popular antioxidants, namely 2-tert-butyl-4-methoxyphenol (BHA). The useful dye quinizarin is produced by diacylation of hydroquinone with phthalic anhydride. === Redox === Hydroquinone can be reversibly oxidised under mild conditions to give benzoquinone. Naturally occurring hydroquinone derivatives, such as coenzyme Q, exhibit similar reactivity, wherein one hydroxyl group is exchanged for an amino group. Given the conditional reversibility and relative ubiquity of reagents, oxidation reactions of hydroquinones and hydroquinone derivatives are of significant commercial use, often used at an industrial scale. When colorless hydroquinone and benzoquinone - bright yellow in solid form - are cocrystallized at a 1:1 ratio, a dark-green crystalline charge-transfer complex (melting point 171 °C), known as quinhydrone (C6H6O2·C6H4O2), is formed. This complex dissolves in hot water, dissociating both quinone molecules in solution. === Amination === An important reaction involves the conversion of hydroquinone to its mono- and di-amine derivatives. One such derivative, methylaminophenol, used in photography, is produced according to the stochiometry: C6H4(OH)2 + CH3NH2 → HOC6H4NHCH3 + H2O Diamines - used in the rubber industry as antiozone agents - aminated from aniline, are formed via a similar pathway: C6H4(OH)2 + 2 C6H5NH2 → C6H4(N(H)C6H5)2 + 2 H2O == Uses == Hydroquinone has a variety of uses principally associated with its action as a reducing agent that is soluble in water. It is a major component in most black and white photographic developers for film and paper where, with the compound metol, it reduces silver halides to elemental silver. There are various other uses associated with its reducing power. As a polymerisation inhibitor, exploiting its antioxidant properties, hydroquinone prevents polymerization of acrylic acid, methyl methacrylate, cyanoacrylate, and other monomers that are susceptible to radical-initiated polymerization. By acting as a free radical scavenger, hydroquinone serves to prolong the shelflife of light-sensitive resins such as preceramic polymers. Hydroquinone can lose a hydrogen cation from both hydroxyl groups to form a diphenolate ion. The disodium diphenolate salt of hydroquinone is used as an alternating comonomer unit in the production of the polymer PEEK. === Skin depigmentation === Hydroquinone is used as a topical application in skin whitening to reduce the color of skin. It does not have the same predisposition to cause dermatitis as metol does. This is a prescription-only ingredient in some countries, including the member states of the European Union under Directives 76/768/EEC:1976. In 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration revoked its previous approval of hydroquinone and proposed a ban on all over-the-counter preparations. The FDA officially banned hydroquinone in 2020 as part of a larger reform of the over-the-counter drug review process. The FDA stated that hydroquinone cannot be ruled out as a potential carcinogen. This conclusion was reached based on the extent of absorption in humans and the incidence of neoplasms in rats in several studies where adult rats were found to have increased rates of tumours, including thyroid follicular cell hyperplasias, anisokaryosis (variation in nuclei sizes), mononuclear cell leukemia, hepatocellular adenomas and renal tubule cell adenomas. The Campaign for Safe Cosmetics has also highlighted concerns. Numerous studies have revealed that hydroquinone, if taken orally, can cause exogenous ochronosis, a disfiguring disease in which blue-black pigments are deposited onto the skin; however, skin preparations containing the ingredient are administered topically. The FDA had classified hydroquinone in 1982 as a safe product - generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE), however additional studies under the National Toxicology Program (NTP) were suggested in order to determine whether there is a risk to humans from the use of hydroquinone. NTP evaluation showed some evidence of long-term carcinogenic and genotoxic effects. While hydroquinone remains widely prescribed for treatment of hyperpigmentation, questions raised about its safety profile by regulatory agencies in the EU, Japan, and USA encourage the search for other agents with comparable efficacy. Several such agents are already available or under research, including azelaic acid, kojic acid, retinoids, cysteamine, topical steroids, glycolic acid, and other substances. One of these, 4-butylresorcinol, has been proved to be more effective at treating melanin-related skin disorders by a wide margin, as well as safe enough to be made available over the counter. In the anthraquinone process substituted hydroquinones, typically anthrahydroquinone are used to produce hydrogen peroxide which forms spontaneously on reaction with oxygen. The type of substituted hydroquinone is selected depending on reactivity and recyclability. == Natural occurrences == Hydroquinones are one of the two primary reagents in the defensive glands of bombardier beetles, along with hydrogen peroxide (and perhaps other compounds, depending on the species), which collect in a reservoir. The reservoir opens through a muscle-controlled valve onto a thick-walled reaction chamber. This chamber is lined with cells that secrete catalases and peroxidases. When the contents of the reservoir are forced into the reaction chamber, the catalases and peroxidases rapidly break down the hydrogen peroxide and catalyze the oxidation of the hydroquinones into p-quinones. These reactions release free oxygen and generate enough heat to bring the mixture to the boiling point and vaporize about a fifth of it, producing a hot spray from the beetle's abdomen. Hydroquinone is thought to be the active toxin in Agaricus hondensis mushrooms. Hydroquinone has been shown to be one of the chemical constituents of the natural product propolis. It is also one of the chemical compounds found in castoreum. This compound is gathered from the beaver's castor sacs. == References == == External links == International Chemical Safety Card 0166 NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards"	Hydroquinone	WIKIPEDIA	('MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL, FOOD', [('MED', -0.07050017267465591), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -0.24231906235218048), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -7.3458322731312364e-06), (' INDUSTR', -0.5232102870941162), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', -0.011057252995669842), (' FOOD', -0.0005342059303075075)])

In the present study, we found that a dipeptide, tyrosyl leucine (Tyr-Leu, YL), administered orally, intracerebroventricularly, or intraperitoneally exhibited a potent antidepressant-like activity in the forced swim and tail suspension tests in naïve mice. YL increased the amount of cells expressing c-Fos, a marker for neuronal activity, in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus. YL increased bromo-2'-deoxyuridine-positive cells and doublecortin expression in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, suggesting that YL enhanced the proliferation of hippocampal progenitor cells in vivo and in vitro. YL did not affect hippocampal mRNA and protein expression of BDNF, which is a regulatory factor of both neurogenesis and depression-like behavior. Intriguingly, YL suppressed activation of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis by forced swim stress. Moreover, other aromatic amino acid-leucines, Phe-Leu and Trp-Leu, also exhibited antidepressant-like activities, suggesting that the structure of aromatic amino acid-leucine may be important for antidepressant activity. In addition, bovine milk casein-derived peptide, Tyr-Leu-Gly (YLG), an anxiolytic peptide, exhibited an antidepressant-like activity. Our findings demonstrate that YL exhibits an antidepressant-like effect, moderates the stress response, and induces hippocampal neuronal proliferation through a signal pathway independent of BDNF.

Platelet-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) can promote epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in cancer cells, which confers high-grade malignancy. 12S-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) generated by platelet-type 12-lipoxygenase (12-LOX) is considered a key modulator of cancer metastasis through unknown mechanisms. In platelets, 12-HETE can be esterified into plasma membrane phospholipids (PLs), which drive thrombosis. Using cocultures of human platelets and human colon adenocarcinoma cells (line HT29) and LC-MS/MS, we investigated the impact of platelets on cancer cell biosynthesis of 12S-HETE and its esterification into PLs and whether platelet ability to transfer its molecular cargo might play a role. To this aim, we performed coculture experiments with CFSE[5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester]-loaded platelets. HT29 cells did not generate 12S-HETE or express 12-LOX. However, they acquired the capacity to produce 12S-HETE mainly esterified in plasmalogen phospholipid forms following the uptake of platelet-derived medium-sized EVs (mEVs) expressing 12-LOX. 12-LOX was detected in plasma mEV of patients with adenomas/adenocarcinomas, implying their potential to deliver the protein to cancer cells in vivo. In cancer cells exposed to platelets, endogenous but not exogenous 12S-HETE contributed to changes in EMT gene expression, mitigated by three structurally unrelated 12-LOX inhibitors. In conclusion, we showed that platelets induce the generation of primarily esterified 12-HETE in colon cancer cells following mEV-mediated delivery of 12-LOX. The modification of cancer cell phospholipids by 12-HETE may functionally impact cancer cell biology and represent a novel target for anticancer agent development. Patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) often exhibit hepatic steatosis and dyslipidemia. Studies have shown that intestinal microorganisms are closely related to the occurrence of NAFLD and atherosclerosis. Our previous study has underscored the protective role of microRNA-30a-5p (miR-30a-5p) against atherosclerosis. In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the effect and underlying mechanism of the intestinal microorganisms of miR-30a-5p knockout (KO) mice on NAFLD. Our findings demonstrated that KO exacerbated high-fat diet (HFD)-induced hepatic steatosis and disrupted liver function, as evidenced by elevated levels of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase, and total bile acids in serum. Fecal microbiota from HFD-fed KO mice induced hepatic steatosis, dyslipidemia, and higher levels of enzymes indicative of liver damage in wild-type mice. Remarkably, KO mice significantly intensified the above effects. 16s rDNA sequencing and metabolomics of the intestinal microbiota in the HFD-treated KO and WT mice showed that the loss of miR-30a-5p resulted in intestinal microbiota imbalance and was highly related to the arachidonic acid metabolic pathway. Targeted metabolomic in the liver tissues unveiled upregulation of COX-related (PGF2a, 8-iso-PGF2a and PGF2) and LOX-related (LTB4, LTD4, 12S-HETE and 15S-HETE) factors in HFD-treated KO mice. Immunohistochemistry and transcriptional analyses showed that miR-30a-5p affected arachidonic acid metabolism through the LOX/COX pathways. Besides, COX/LOX pathways and hepatic steatosis were reversed after reintroducing miR-30a-5p in HFD-treated KO mice. This study reveals the pivotal mechanism by which miR-30a-5p and intestinal microbes regulate hepatic steatosis and abnormal lipid metabolism, offering promising avenues for NAFLD and atherosclerosis therapeutics. MiR-30a-5p deletion aggravated hepatic steatosis and lipid disorder induced by an HFD in mice. Gut microbiota participated in the regulation of hepatic steatosis in the context of miR-30a-5p. Gut microbiota metabolism-related arachidonic acid metabolic pathway contributed to miR-30a-5p-regulated hepatic steatosis and lipid disorder. Reintroducing miR-30a-5p reversed hepatic steatosis and arachidonic acid metabolism disorder caused by HFD and miR-30a-5p deletion. Polyunsaturated fatty acids are important signaling molecules. A recent study reported hexadeca-4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z-tetraenoic acid, 12-oxo-5Z,8E,10E-heptadecatrienoic acid, and (12S)-hydroxy-5Z,8E,10E-heptadecatrienoic acid as chemotherapy resistance-inducing factors when tumor cells were treated with cisplatin. Marine-based food supplements like fish oil or algae extracts are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids and can contain large amounts of hexadeca-4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z-tetraenoic acid. Thus, it was concluded that oral uptake of hexadeca-4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z-tetraenoic acid might induce chemoresistance as shown in a mouse model. Cancer patients tend to consume food supplements containing polyunsaturated fatty acids on a regular basis. The uptake of hexadeca-4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z-tetraenoic acid and (12S)-hydroxy-5Z,8E,10E-heptadecatrienoic acid should be controlled, because even low concentrations of 0.5 ng mL	(12s)-12-hydroxyheptadec-16-ynoic acid	PUBMED	('INFO', [('INFO', -0.014495240524411201)])

Key to this new strategy is the use of a chiral Horner-Wittig reagent, readily available from 2-deoxy-D-ribose, to introduce the chiral 1,3-diol motif. Distal metastases from breast cancer, especially bone metastases, are extremely common in the late stages of the disease and are associated with a poor prognosis. EMT is a biomarker of the early process of bone metastasis, and MMP-9 and MMP-13 are important osteoclastic activators. Previously, we found that meso-Hannokinol (HA) could significantly inhibit EMT and MMP-9 and MMP-13 expressions in breast cancer cells. On this basis, we further explored the role of HA in breast cancer bone metastasis. In vivo, we established a breast cancer bone metastasis model by intracardially injecting breast cancer cells. Intraperitoneal injections of HA significantly reduced breast cancer cell metastasis to the leg bone in mice and osteolytic lesions caused by breast cancer. In vitro, HA inhibited the migration and invasion of breast cancer cells and suppressed the expressions of EMT, MMP-9, MMP-13, and other osteoclastic activators. HA inhibited EMT and MMP-9 by activating the ROS/JNK pathway as demonstrated by siJNK and SP600125 inhibition of JNK phosphorylation and NAC scavenging of ROS accumulation. Moreover, HA promoted bone formation and inhibited bone resorption in vitro. In conclusion, our findings suggest that HA may be an excellent candidate for treating breast cancer bone metastasis.

Due to the rapid emergence of resistant strains in recent years, an ecofriendly disease management strategy needs to be developed to control this aggressive pathogen. Bacillus velezensis CE 100 exhibited strong antagonistic activity with 53.05% against B. cinerea by dual culture method. In the present study, 50% of culture filtrate supplemented into PDA medium absolutely inhibited mycelial growth of B. cinerea whereas the highest concentration (960 mg/L) of different crude extracts including ethyl acetate, chloroform, and n-butanol crude extracts of B. velezensis CE 100, strongly inhibited mycelial growth of B. cinerea with the highest inhibition of 79.26%, 70.21% and 69.59% respectively, resulting in severe damage to hyphal structures with bulging and swellings. Hence, the antifungal compound responsible was progressively separated from ethyl acetate crude extract using medium pressure liquid chromatography. The purified compound was identified as methyl hippurate by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry. The inhibitory effect of methyl hippurate on both spore germination and mycelial growth of B. cinerea was revealed by its dose-dependent pattern. The spore germination rate was completely restricted at a concentration of 3 mg/mL of methyl hippurate whereas no mycelial growth was observed in agar medium supplemented with 4 mg/mL and 6 mg/mL of methyl hippurate by poisoned food method.

5165.0	('Pseudouridine', 'Beta-pseudouridine', 'Pseudouridine c', 'Psi-uridine', 'Pseudo uridine')	mouse	Pseudouridine (5-ribosyluracil, abbreviated by the Greek letter psi- Ψ) is an isomer of the nucleoside uridine in which the uracil is attached via a carbon-carbon instead of a nitrogen-carbon glycosidic bond. Pseudouridine is the most abundant RNA modification in cellular RNA and one of over 100 chemically distinct modifications that may affect translation or other functions of RNA. Pseudouridine is the C5-glycoside isomer of uridine that contains a C-C bond between C1 of the ribose sugar and C5 of uracil, rather than usual C1-N1 bond found in uridine. Uridine is converted to pseudouridine by rotating the uridine molecule 180° across its N3-C6 axis. The C-C bond gives it more rotational freedom and conformational flexibility. In addition, pseudouridine has an extra hydrogen bond donor at the N1 position. Pseudouridine is a ubiquitous constituent of structural RNA (transfer, ribosomal, small nuclear (snRNA) and small nucleolar), and present in mRNA, across the three phylogenetic domains of life and was the first discovered. It accounts for 4% of the nucleotides in yeast tRNA. This base modification is able to stabilize RNA and improve base-stacking by forming additional hydrogen bonds with water through its extra imino group. There are 11 pseudouridines in Escherichia coli rRNA, 30 in yeast cytoplasmic rRNA and a single modification in mitochondrial 21S rRNA and about 100 pseudouridines in human rRNA indicating that the extent of pseudouridylation increases with the complexity of an organism. Pseudouridine was also detected in the Leishmania donovani genome. 18 pseudouridine modification sites were detected in the peptidyl transferase entry site and in the mRNA entry tunnel in protein translation. These modifications in the parasite lead to increased protein synthesis and growth rate. Pseudouridine in rRNA and tRNA has been shown to fine-tune and stabilize the regional structure and help maintain their functions in mRNA decoding, ribosome assembly, processing and translation. Pseudouridine in snRNA has been shown to enhance spliceosomal RNA-pre-mRNA interaction to facilitate splicing regulation. == Effects and modification on different RNA == === tRNA === Ψ is ubiquitous in this class of RNAs and facilitates common tRNA structural motifs. One such structural motif is the TΨC stem loop which incorporates Ψ55. Ψ is commonly found in the D stem and anticodon stem and loop of tRNAs from each domain. In each structural motif the unique physicochemical properties of Ψ stabilize structures that would not be possible with the standard U. During translation Ψ modulates interactions of tRNA molecules with rRNAs and mRNAs. Ψ and other modified nucleotides affect the local structure of the tRNA domains they are found in without impacting the overall fold of the RNA. In the anticodon stem-loop (ASL) Ψ seems critical for proper binding of tRNAs to the ribosome. Ψ stabilizes the dynamic structure of the ASL and promotes stronger binding to the 30S ribosome. The stabilized conformation of the ASL helps maintain correct anticodon-codon pairings during translation. This stability may increase translational accuracy by decreasing the rate of peptide bond formation and allowing for more time for incorrect codon-anticodon pairs to be rejected. Despite Ψ’s role in local structure stabilization, pseudouridylation of tRNA is not essential for cell viability and is not usually required for aminoacylation. === mRNA === Ψ is also found in mRNAs which are the template for protein synthesis. Ψ residues in mRNA can affect the coding specificity of stop codons UAA, UGA, and UAG. In these stop codons both a U→Ψ modification and a U→C mutation both promote nonsense suppression. In the SARS-CoV2 vaccine from BioNTech/Pfizer, also known as BNT162b2, tozinameran or Comirnaty, all U's have been substituted with N1-methylpseudouridine, a nucleoside related to Ψ that contains a methyl group added to N1 atom. === rRNA === Ψ is found in the large and small ribosomal subunits of all domains of life and their organelles. In the ribosome Ψ residues cluster in domains II, IV, and V and stabilize RNA-RNA and/or RNA-protein interactions. The stability afforded by Ψ may assist rRNA folding and ribosome assembly. Ψ may also influence the stability of local structures which impact the speed and accuracy of decoding and proofreading during translation. === snRNA === Ψ is found in the major spliceosomal snRNAs of eukaryotes. Ψ residues in snRNA are often phylogenetically conserved, but have some variations across taxa and organisms. The Ψ residues in snRNAs are normally located in regions that participate in RNA-RNA and/or RNA-protein interactions involved in the assembly and function of the spliceosome. Ψ residues in snRNAS contribute to the proper folding and assembly of the spliceosome which is essential for pre-mRNA processing. == Synthases == Pseudouridine are RNA modifications that are done post-transcription, so after the RNA is formed . The proteins that do this modification are called pseudouridine synthases (PUS) and are found in all kingdoms of life. Most research has been done on how PUS modify tRNA, so mechanisms involving snRNA, and mRNA are not clearly defined. PUS can vary on RNA specificity, structure, and isomerization mechanisms. The different structures of PUS are divided into five families which share the active sequence and important structural motifs. === TruA === TruA domain modifies a variety of different places in tRNA, snRNA, and mRNA. The mechanism of isomerization of uridine is still being talked about in this family. PUS 1 is located in the nucleus and modifies tRNA at different locations, U44 of U2 snRNA, and U28 of U6 snRNA. Studies found that PUS 1 expression increased during environmental stress and is important for regulating the splicing of RNA. Also, that PUS 1 is necessary for taking the tRNA made in the nucleus and sending them to the cytoplasm. PUS 2 is very similar to PUS 1, but located in the mitochondria and only modifies U27 and U28 of mito-tRNA. This protein modifies the mitochondrial tRNA, which has a lesser amount of pseudouridine modifications compared to other tRNAs. Unlike most mitochondria located protein, PUS 2 has not been found to have a mitochondrial targeting signal or MTS. PUS 3 is a homolog to PUS 1, but modifies different places of the tRNA (U38/39) in the cytoplasm and mitochondrial. This protein is the most conserved of the TruA family. A decrease in modifications made by PUS 3 was found when the tRNA structure of improperly folded. Along with tRNA the protein targets ncRNA and mRNA, further research is still needed as to the importance of this modification. PUS 3 along with PUS 1 modify the steroid activator receptor in humans. === TruB === The TruB family only contains PUS 4 located in the mitochondrial and nucleus. PUS 4 modification is heavily conserved located in the U55 in the elbow of the tRNA. The human form of PUS 4 is actually missing a binding domain called PUA or pseudouridine synthase and archaeosine trans-glycosylase. PUS 4 has a sequence specificity for T-loop part of the tRNA. Preliminary data of PUS4 modifying mRNA, but more research is needed to confirm. Also binds to a specific Brome Mosaic Virus, which is a plant-infecting RNA virus. === TruD === TruD is able to modify a variety of RNA, and it is unclear how these different RNA substrates are recognized. PUS 7 modifies U2 snRNA at the position 35 and this modification will increase when the cells are in heat shock. Another modification is cytoplasmic tRNA in position 13, and position 35 in pre-tRNATyr. PUS 7 modifies almost specificity does not depend on the type of RNA as mRNA show pseudouridylated by PUS 7. Recognize this the sequence of the RNA, UGUAR with the second U being the nucleotide that will be modified. The pseudouridylation of mRNA by PUS 7 increases during heat shock, because the protein moves from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. The modification is thought to increase the stability of mRNA during heat shock before the RNA goes to the nucleus or mitochondria, but more studies are needed. === RluA === The RluA domain of these proteins can identify the substrate through a different protein binding to the substrate and then particular bonds to the RluA domain. PUS 5 is not well studied and located pseudouridine synthase and similar to Pus 2 does not have a mitochondrial signal targeting sequence. The protein modifies U2819 of mitochondrial 21S rRNA. Also suspected that Pus 5 modifies some uridines in the mRNA, but again more data is needed to confirm. PUS 6 has one that only modifies U31 of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial tRNA. Pus 6 is also known to modify mRNA. PUS 8 also known as Rib2 modifies cytoplasmic tRNA at position U32. On the C-terminus there is a DRAP-deaminase domain related to the biosynthesis of riboflavin. The RluA and DRAP or deaminase domain related to riboflavin synthase have completely separate functions in the protein and it is not known whether they interact with each other. PUS 8 is necessary in yeast, but that is suspected to be related to the riboflavin synthesis and not the pseudouridine modification. PUS 9 and PUS 8 catalyze the same position in mitochondrial tRNA instead of cytoplasmic. It is the only PUS protein that contains a mitochondrial targeting signal domain on the N-terminus. Studies suggest that PUS 9 can modify mRNAs, which would mean less substrate specificity. === RsuA === == Techniques in genome sequencing for pseudouridine == Pseudouridine can be identified through a multitude of different techniques. A common technique to identify modifications in RNA and DNA is Liquid Chromatography with Mass Spectrometry or LC-MS. Mass spectrometry separates molecules by the mass and charge. While uridine and pseudouridine have the same mass, they have different charges. Liquid chromatography works by retention time, which has to do with leaving the column. A chemical way to identify pseudouridine uses a compound called CMC or N-cyclohexyl-N′-β-(4-methylmorpholinium) ethylcarbodiimide to specifically label and distinguish uridine from pseudouridine. CMC will bond both with pseudouridine and uridine, but holds tighter to the former, because of the third nitrogen able to form hydrogen bond. CMC bound to pseudouridine can then be imaged by tagging a signaling molecule. This method is still being worked on to become high-throughput. An improved technique, 2-bromoacrylamide-assisted cyclization sequencing, enables Ψ-to-C transitions, for quantitative profiling of Ψ at single-base resolution. == Medical relevance of pseudouridine == Pseudouridine exerts a subtle but significant influence on the nearby sugar-phosphate backbone and also enhances base stacking. These effects may underlie the biological role of most, but perhaps not all of the pseudouridine residues in RNA. Certain genetic mutants lacking specific pseudouridine residues in tRNA or rRNA exhibit difficulties in translation, display slow growth rates, and fail to compete effectively with wild-type strains in mixed culture. Pseudouridine modifications are also implicated in human diseases such as mitochondrial myopathy and sideroblastic anemia (MLASA) and Dyskeratosis congenita. Dyskeratosis congenita and Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome are two rare inherited syndromes caused by mutations in DKC1, the gene encoding for the pseudouridine synthase dyskerin. Pseudouridines have been recognized as regulators of viral latency processes in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. Pseudouridylation has also been associated with the pathogenesis of maternally inherited diabetes and deafness (MIDD). In particular, a point mutation in a mitochondrial tRNA seems to prevent the pseudouridylation of one nucleotide, thus altering the tRNA tertiary structure. This may lead to higher tRNA instability, causing deficiencies in mitochondrial translation and respiration. === Vaccines === When pseudouridine is used in place of uridine in synthetic mRNA, the modified mRNA molecule arouses less response from Toll-like receptors, a part of the human immune system that would otherwise identify the mRNA as unwelcome. This makes pseudouridine useful in mRNA vaccines, including the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. This property of pseudouridine was discovered by Katalin Karikó and Drew Weissman in 2005, for which they shared the 2023 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. N1-Methylpseudouridine provides even less innate immune response than Ψ, as well as improving translation capacity. Both Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines therefore use N1-Methylpseudouridine rather than Ψ. == See also == Pseudouridine kinase TRNA-pseudouridine synthase PUS1 == References ==	Pseudouridine	WIKIPEDIA	('ENDOGENOUS, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.0028267467860132456), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -2.5776860184123507e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.5761557817459106), (' MED', -0.04914567619562149), ('ICAL', 0.0)])

Studies with cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase inhibitors indicated that this metabolite is a lipoxygenase product. The metabolite has been purified by sequential use of t.l.c. and h.p.l.c. and identified as 8-hydroxy-5Z,9E,11Z,14Z-eicosatetraenoic acid (8-HETE) by means of GC-MS and 1H-n.m.r. spectroscopy. To assist in the characterization of AAMX, a reference mixture of 8-HETE and 9-HETE was used for which a complete structural analysis could be performed using one- and two-dimensional 1H-n.m.r. at 500 MHz. The production of 8-HETE has been shown to start with a lag phase of 3 h after TPA treatment and to reach a maximum after 24-48 h. Nonpromoting phorbol esters are 10-fold, the Ca2+-ionophore A 23187 100-fold, less efficient in inducing in vivo the lipoxygenase responsible for 8-HETE production. 3-Day-old neonatal mice cannot be induced to generate 8-HETE in response to TPA, whereas 8-day-old mice show an extremely strong response. Neither primary basal keratinocytes, isolated from TPA-treated mouse epidermis nor TPA-treated epidermal cell lines generate 8-HETE, indicating that the metabolite may not originate from these epithelial cells. A new class of dual PPARs alpha and gamma agonists was developed. These compounds are structural analogues of the arachidonic acid metabolite, the 8-(S)-HETE. A versatile strategy has been introduced to prepare the target molecules having different carbo- and heterocyclic cores and to modulate the unsaturations on the side chains. Their affinity towards the PPARs alpha and gamma receptors is reported, together with their transactivation percentage. Most of these derivatives have a good activity as dual agonists but the quinoline-derived products appear as the most promising compounds.

As a result, glycemic regulation and energy homeostasis may be improved. Food protein-derived peptides have been identified as natural agents capable of inhibiting DPP-IV. Ile-Pro-Ile is the most potent DPP-IV inhibitory peptide identified to date. A minimum analog peptide set approach was used to study peptide analogs of Ile-Pro-Ile. The DPP-IV half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC Dipeptidyl peptidase IV preferably hydrolyzes peptides and proteins with a penultimate proline residue. Umezawa and co-workers (Umezawa et al. (1984) J. Antibiotics 37, 422-425) reported that diprotin A (Ile-Pro-Ile) and diprotin B (Val-Pro-Leu) are inhibitors for dipeptidyl peptidase IV. We could show that both compounds as well as other tripeptides with a penultimate proline residue are substrates for dipeptidyl peptidase IV. An apparent competitive inhibition by those compounds is a kinetic artifact due to the substrate-like structure of such tripeptides. We have found recently that membrane-bound dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) generated extracellularly immunoreactive endomorphin-2 from Tyr-Pro precursor in a depolarisation-sensitive manner in rat isolated L4,5 dorsal root ganglia when the enzyme was switched to synthase mode by the hydrolase inhibitor Ile-Pro-Ile. Presently, we induced hyperalgesia in rats by injecting carrageenan into the right hindpaw and measured the reduction in nociceptive threshold (hyperalgesia) to pressure (Randall-Selitto test). The hyperalgesia, peaking at 180 min after injection, was fully reversed by intrathecal administration of 30 nmol/rat Ile-Pro-Ile. The antihyperalgesic action was antagonized by s.c. naloxone (1 mg/kg) and intrathecally injected specific antiserum to endomorphin-2 indicating that the opioid receptor-mediated effect was produced by an endogenously generated endomorphin-2-like immunoreactive substance. Intrathecal Ile-Pro-Ile was ineffective as an analgesic in the acute nociceptive test such as the rat tail-flick, whereas endomorphin-2 (EC(50)=13.3 nmol/rat), endomorphin-1 (6.8 nmol/rat), morphine (0.11 nmol/rat) and DAMGO (0.0059 nmol/rat) exerted opioid receptor-mediated analgesia given by the same route. We concluded that carrageenan-induced C-fiber barrage (wind-up) may create ideal conditions for the de novo synthesis of endomorphin-2 in rat spinal cord dorsal horns if the DPP-IV enzyme is switched to the synthase functional mode by Ile-Pro-Ile.

The total excretion of adipic, suberic and sebacic acid ranged from 0.77 to 1.3 mg/mg creatinine after episodes of acute attack of the disease. Suberylglycine, identified by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry, was repeatedly found in the urine samples. The amount of this conjugate ranged from 0.2 to 0.5 mg/mg creatinine. The precursors of the dicarboxylic acids are suggested to be long chain monocarboxylic acids, oxidized through omega- and beta-oxidation to adipic, suberic and sebacic acid. Suberylglycine is subsequently formed by glycine-N-acylase catalyzed conjugation. We describe a gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric method for the accurate determination of n-hexanoylglycine, 3-phenylpropionylglycine and suberylglycine in urine for the diagnosis of hereditary medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) deficiency. These acylglycines had previously been detected in urine from patients with MCAD deficiency, but their diagnostic values were unknown because of a lack of appropriate analytical methods. n-Hexanoyl(1,2-13C)glycine, 3-phenylpropionyl(2-13C,15N)glycine and suberyl(2-13C,15N)glycine were synthesized and used as internal standards. Ammonia chemical ionization was utilized to generate intense [M + H]+ ions for selected-ion monitoring quantification. The whole procedure is fast and can be performed by a low-resolution gas chromatographic/mass spectrometric system, giving accurate results over a range of three orders of magnitude (0.0167-16.7 micrograms/ml). The results from the analyses of 54 urine samples from 21 MCAD-deficient patients and various control samples using this method established that n-hexanoyglycine and 3-phenylpropionylglycine were highly diagnostic for this disease, while suberylglycine was found less specific.

Cholestanol and cholesterol accumulate in all tissues. At least part of the accumulation of cholestanol is due to a 7 alpha-dehydroxylation of early bile acid intermediates. Cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one, a proposed intermediate in this pathway, is found in increased concentrations in serum of the patients. This study shows that cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one may be metabolized to 4-cholesten-3-one and cholestanol by liver, adrenals and brain. No conversion was found in intestinal mucosa or in kidneys. The capacity to convert cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one into 4-cholesten-3-one and cholestanol varied in different tissues as well as in different species. The results are discussed in relation to the cholestanol accumulation in CTX. Evidence was recently presented that an essential part of the accumulation of cholestanol in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is due to acceleration of a novel pathway, involving 7 alpha-hydroxylated intermediates in bile acid biosynthesis as precursors (J. Clin. Invest. 1985; 75:448-456). Such intermediates accumulate in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis due to lack of the mitochondrial 26-hydroxylase involved in the major pathway for bile acid biosynthesis. The new pathway may involve the following steps: 7 alpha-hydroxycholesterol----7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one----cholesta-4,6- dien-3-one----4-cholesten-3-one----cholestanol. Accurate methods have been developed for assay of 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one in serum, based on isotope dilution-mass spectrometry. The serum levels of 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one as well as those of cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one were found to be markedly elevated in the three patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. Treatment of two of the patients with chenodeoxycholic acid reduced the serum levels of the two steroids by more than 80%. The concentration of cholestanol was reduced by 72% in one patient and by 48% in the other. The possibility is discussed that accumulation of cholestanol in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is secondary to accumulation of 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one and cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one. The mechanism and stereochemistry in connection with enzymatic conversion of cholesta-4,6-dien-3-one into cholestanol was studied. Rat and mouse liver microsomes are able to catalyze NADPH-dependent sequential saturation of the two double bonds. Evidence was obtained that the saturation of the delta 6-double bond includes transfer of a hydride ion from the B-side of the cofactor to the 7-position of the steroid (mainly 7 beta-position), followed by addition of a proton to the 6 alpha-position (mainly trans addition). The saturation of the delta 4-double bond includes transfer of a hydride ion from the B-side of the cofactor to the 5 alpha-position of the steroid followed by addition of a proton to the 4 beta-position (trans addition). The reduction of the 3-oxo group was found to involve transfer of a hydride ion from the B-side of the cofactor NADPH to the 3 alpha-position of the steroid. The results are in accord with the contention that the enzymatic saturation of the two double bonds involves a polarization of the 3-oxo group making C-7 electrophilic and C-6 nucleophilic in connection with the saturation of the delta 6-double bond and C-5 electrophilic and C-4 nucleophilic in connection with the saturation of the delta 4-double bond.

It is a secondary amide between glucosamine and acetic acid. It is significant in several biological systems. It is part of a biopolymer in the bacterial cell wall, which is built from alternating units of GlcNAc and N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc), cross-linked with oligopeptides at the lactic acid residue of MurNAc. This layered structure is called peptidoglycan (formerly called murein). GlcNAc is the monomeric unit of the polymer chitin, which forms the exoskeletons of arthropods like insects and crustaceans. It is the main component of the radulas of mollusks, the beaks of cephalopods, and a major component of the cell walls of most fungi. Polymerized with glucuronic acid, it forms hyaluronan. GlcNAc has been reported to be an inhibitor of elastase release from human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (range 8–17% inhibition), however this is much weaker than the inhibition seen with N-acetylgalactosamine (range 92–100%). == Medical uses == It has been proposed as a treatment for autoimmune diseases and recent tests have claimed some success. == O-GlcNAcylation == O-GlcNAcylation is the process of adding a single N-acetylglucosamine sugar to the serine or threonine of a protein. Comparable to phosphorylation, addition or removal of N-acetylglucosamine is a means of activating or deactivating enzymes or transcription factors. In fact, O-GlcNAcylation and phosphorylation often compete for the same serine/threonine sites. O-GlcNAcylation most often occurs on chromatin proteins, and is often seen as a response to stress. Hyperglycemia increases O-GlcNAcylation, leading to insulin resistance. Increased O-GlcNAcylation due to hyperglycemia is evidently a dysfunctional form of O-GlcNAcylation. O-GlcNAcylation decline in the brain with age is associated with cognitive decline. When O-GlcNAcylation was increased in the hippocampus of aged mice, spatial learning and memory improved. == See also == Keratan sulfate N-Acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) N-Acetyllactosamine synthase Wheat germ agglutinin, a plant lectin that binds to this substrate == References == == External links == Re Multiple Sclerosis	Glcnac	WIKIPEDIA	('INFO', [('INFO', -0.08722802996635437)])

While the cyclization of Leu-Pro-Leu-D-Pro did not cause problems, the all-L-peptide afforded cyclodimer rather than cyclotetrapeptide (cyclomonomer). A first attempt using our reversible backbone substitution methodology failed. However, we were successful in obtaining the desired cyclo(Leu-Pro-Leu-Pro) by decreasing the concentration. The ratio of cyclomonomer to cyclodimer was raised to 1:1.1 using BOP and 1:0.6 using HATU under our high dilution condition. The structures of the cyclopeptides were confidently assigned by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and NMR. Comparative effects of Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2 (MIF) and cyclo(Leu-Gly) (CLG) administered orally at different stages of chronic morphine treatment on the development of tolerance to the analgesic effect of morphine in the rat were determined. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were implanted with either 6 placebo or morphine pellets during a 7-day period. Implantation of morphine pellets resulted in the development of a high degree of tolerance as evidenced by a decrease in the analgesic response to morphine. Administration of CLG (8 and 16 mg/kg/day) on day 5, 6 and 7 of implantation inhibited the development of tolerance to morphine but 4 and 32 mg/kg doses had no effect. Further, CLG (2 mg/kg/day for 7 days) inhibited the development of tolerance but higher doses (4 and 8 mg/kg) had no effect. MIF (26 and 52 mg/kg) administered orally on the last three days of the implantation schedule inhibited the development of tolerance to morphine. MIF (6.5 mg/kg/day for 7 days) inhibited the development of tolerance but the higher doses had no effect. Concurrent administration of MIF (6.5 mg/kg) and CLG (2 mg/kg) for seven days failed to inhibit the development of tolerance. A single dose of MIF or CLG administered a day before the assessment of tolerance did not affect the morphine tolerance. Thus, even after a significant degree of tolerance to morphine had developed, neuropeptides like MIF and CLG given orally, in appropriate doses, can inhibit development of tolerance to morphine and restore the analgesic effect of morphine. The effects of Pro-Leu-Gly-NH2 (melanotropin release inhibiting factor, MIF) and its analog, cyclo (Leu-Gly) on the mouse and rat striatal cholinergic muscarinic receptors labeled with 3H-quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB) were investigated. 3H-QNB bound to the rat striatal muscarinic receptors at a single high affinity site with receptor density (Bmax value) of 1200 fmol per mg protein and an apparent dissociation constant (Kd value) of 53.5 pM. At 140 pM concentration of 3H-QNB, the specific binding to the receptors was 724 fmol per mg protein. MIF in a concentration range of 10(-9) to 10(-4) M did not alter the binding of 3H-QNB but at 10(-3) M decreased the binding by 25%. Cyclo (Leu-Gly), on the other hand, in the concentration range of 10(-9) to 10(-3) M had no effect on the binding of 3H-QNB. A single injection of MIF (3 or 10 mg/kg IP) to rats did not alter the Bmax or the Kd value of 3H-QNB to bind to the striatal membranes. 3H-QNB bound to the mouse striatal muscarinic receptors at a single high affinity site with a Bmax value of 991 fmol/per mg protein and a Kd value of 21 pM. Neither acute administration of MIF (3 or 10 mg/kg IP) nor chronic treatment of the peptide (2, 8 or 32 mg/kg IP, daily for 5 days) to mice could influence the binding of 3H-QNB to the striatal muscarinic receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)	Cyclo(pro-leu)	PUBMED	('MEDICAL', [('MED', -0.07940810173749924), ('ICAL', 0.0)])

The structure, N6-succinyladenosine, N-(9-B-D-ribofuranosylpurin-6-yl)aspartic acid was assigned on the basis of spectral data, chemical degradation, and by synthesis. The ultraviolet and mass spectra, chromatographic and electrophoretic mobilities, and the chemical properties of the naturally occurring nucleoside were identical to those of the synthetic N6-succinyladenosine. In contrast to the methylated and hypermodified nucleosides which are products of RNA catabolism, this urinary nucleoside appears to be derived from adenylosuccinic acid, a key intermediate required in the biosynthesis of ubiquitous, natural purine nucleotide adenosine-5'-monophosphate (AMP). Succinyladenosine (S-Ado) is a biochemical marker of adenylosuccinase deficiency--the genetic defect of purine de novo synthesis. S-Ado has been previously reported as normally undetectable in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of children not suffering from this defect. In present study, we employed solid-phase extraction and thin-layer chromatography for isolation of a compound with spectral and chromatographic characteristics identical to S-Ado from human CSF. The high-performance liquid chromatography-negative-ion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry analysis confirmed that the isolated compound is S-Ado. We established the reference values of S-Ado in CSF of children (1.1+/-0.4 micromol/l; mean +/- S.D; n = 26) by means of reversed-phase HPLC method on a C18 column with UV detection. The enzyme adenylosuccinate lyase (ADSL) intervenes twice in the biosynthesis of adenine nucleotides. ADSL deficiency is an inherited metabolic disease characterized by various degrees of psychomotor retardation and accumulation of dephosphorylated enzyme substrates 5-amino-4-imidazole-N-succinocarboxamide riboside (SAICAr) and succinyladenosine (SAdo) in body fluids. Severity of symptoms seems to correlate with residual activity of mutant enzyme and with SAdo/SAICAr concentration ratio in cerebrospinal fluid. To better understand the pathogenetic mechanisms of the disease symptoms, studies of catalytic properties of mutant enzymes together with in vitro and in vivo experiments utilizing SAICAr and SAdo must be performed. Such studies require availability of both ADSL substrates, 5-amino-4-imidazole-N-succinocarboxamide ribotide (SAICAR) and succinyladenosine 5'-monophosphate (SAMP) and their dephosphorylated products in sufficient amounts and purity. Except for SAMP, none of these compounds is commercially available and they must therefore be synthesized. SAICAR was prepared by recombinant human ADSL-catalysed reaction of AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide) with fumarate and isolated by thin-layer chromatography. SAICAr and SAdo were prepared by calf intestine alkaline phosphatase-catalysed dephosphorylation of SAICAR and SAMP and isolated on cation- and anion-exchange resin columns. The procedures described are easily scalable and provide high yields of sufficiently pure products for use in experiments related to studies of pathogenetic mechanisms in ADSL deficiency.

Glycation adducts were determined by LC with tandem MS detection. In diabetic rats, the fructosyl-lysine concentration was increased markedly in glomeruli, retina, sciatic nerve and plasma protein. The concentrations of N (epsilon)-carboxymethyl-lysine and N (epsilon)-carboxyethyl-lysine were increased in glomeruli, sciatic nerve and plasma protein, and N(epsilon)-carboxymethyl-lysine also in the retina. Hydroimidazolone AGEs derived from glyoxal, methylglyoxal and 3-deoxylglucosone were major AGEs quantitatively. They were increased in the retina, nerve, glomeruli and plasma protein. AGE accumulation in renal glomeruli, retina, peripheral nerve and plasma proteins is consistent with a role for AGEs in the development of nephropathy, retinopathy and peripheral neuropathy in diabetes. High-dose therapy with thiamine and Benfotiamine suppressed the accumulation of AGEs, and is a novel approach to preventing the development of diabetic complications. In Fusarium oxysporum S-1F4, fructosyl lysine oxidase (FLOD) was induced with N epsilon-fructosyl N alpha-Z-lysine (epsilon-FL), which is a model compound of a glycated protein, and the induction was inhibited by the addition of cycloheximide in the growing cells. FLOD formation was greatly enhanced in an autoclave-browned medium containing glucose and L-lysine. Some Amadori compounds formed from glucose and L-lysine during autoclaving were assumed to induce the enzyme. After optimization of the culture conditions, FLOD produced in the browned medium was comparable to that in the medium with epsilon-FL. Fructosyl lysine oxidase (FLOD) was examined for its use in the enzymatic measurement of the level of glycated albumin in blood serum. To isolate microorganisms having such an enzyme activity, we used N epsilon-fructosyl N alpha-Z-lysine (epsilon-FL) as a sole nitrogen source in the enrichment culture medium. The isolated fungus, strain S-1F4, showed a high FLOD activity in the cell-free extract and was identified as Fusarium oxysporum. FLOD was purified to an apparent homogeneity on SDS-PAGE. The molecular mass of the subunit was 50 kDa on SDS-PAGE and seemed to exist in a monomeric form. The enzyme had an absorption spectrum characteristic of a flavoprotein and the flavin was found to be covalently bound to the enzyme. The enzyme acted against N epsilon-fructosyl N alpha-Z-lysine and N alpha-fructosyl N epsilon-Z-lysine and showed specificity for fructosyl lysine residues.

DPA is primarily used to designate two isomers, all-cis-4,7,10,13,16-docosapentaenoic acid (i.e. 4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z-docosapentaenoic acid) and all-cis-7,10,13,16,19-docosapentaenoic acid (i.e. 7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z-docosapentaenoic acid). They are also commonly termed n-6 DPA and n-3 DPA, respectively; these designations describe the position of the double bond being 6 or 3 carbons closest to the (omega) carbon at the methyl end of the molecule and is based on the biologically important difference that n-6 and n-3 PUFA are separate PUFA classes, i.e. the omega-6 fatty acids and omega-3 fatty acids, respectively. Mammals, including humans, can not interconvert these two classes and therefore must obtain dietary essential PUFA fatty acids from both classes in order to maintain normal health (see essential fatty acids). == Isomers == The two isomers osbond acid and clupanodonic acid have the same number of double bonds, but on different positions along the chain, so they are regioisomers. === all-cis-4,7,10,13,16-docosapentaenoic acid (osbond acid) === n-6 DPA is an ω-6 fatty acid with the trivial name osbond acid. It is formed in two steps from eicosatetraenoic acid (5,8,11,14-20:4n-6 or arachidonic acid, AA). Arachidonic acid is elongated to docosatetraenoic acid (7,10,13,16-22:4n-6 or adrenic acid, AdA), which in turn is converted by Δ4-desaturase to osbond acid. === all-cis-7,10,13,16,19-docosapentaenoic acid (clupanodonic acid) === n-3 DPA is an n-3 fatty acid with the trivial name clupanodonic acid. It is an intermediate compound between eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA 5,8,11,14,17-20:5n-3 or timnodonic acid) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA 4,7,10,13,16,19-22:6n-3 or cervonic acid) in the metabolic pathway of DHA in eucaryotes. Eicosapentaenoic acid is elongated to clupanodonic acid, which in turn is converted by Δ4-desaturase to docosahexaenoic acid 22:6n-3 (see Docosahexaenoic acid § Biosynthesis). Mammalian cells, including human cells, metabolize DPAn-3 to an array of products that are members of the specialized proresolving mediators class of PUFA metabolites.

Most RCCs are incidentally diagnosed as initial symptoms are unspecific. Novel, minimally-invasive diagnostic and prognostic methods for RCC are needed, ideally in urine. Using UPLC-Q-ToF MS untargeted metabolomic analysis in urine, we previously revealed p-cresol glucuronide as potential RCC diagnostic marker. Additionally, urine samples one-year post-nephrectomy revealed isobutyryl-l-carnitine and L-proline betaine as potential RCC prognostic markers. Our present aim was to validate these differences in an independent cohort of RCC patients and healthy controls to strengthen their value as non-invasive biomarkers. In an independent cohort of 69 RCC patients and 52 controls we validated an increase in p-cresol glucuronide in urine from patients at diagnosis compared to controls (P = 0.0043). It remained increased one-year post-nephrectomy (P = 0.0288). The value of p-cresol glucuronide for RCC diagnosis was assessed with ROC curves analysis (AUC = 0.66, 95 % Confidence Interval 0.56-0.76). The role of isobutyryl-l-carnitine and L-proline betaine as prognostic markers could not be validated and will require a larger cohort. Our findings confirm the value of p-cresol glucuronide in urine as diagnostic marker for RCC in an independent cohort. This non-invasive method holds promise for enhancing patient care by reducing the need for potentially risky diagnostic procedures. Further metaproteomics-oriented approaches towards the tyrosine oxidation pathway and microbiota metagenomics studies may promote a holistic management of RCC.

It is urgent to find one new precise prevention and control therapy. The dynamically changing biomarkers during the development of pediatric pneumonia could help diagnose this disease, determine its severity, assess the risk of future events, and guide its treatment. Dexamethasone has been recognized as an effective agent with anti-inflammatory activity. However, its mechanisms against pediatric pneumonia remain unclear. In this study, spatial metabolomics was used to reveal the potential and characteristics of dexamethasone. Specifically, bioinformatics was first applied to find the critical biomarkers of differential expression in pediatric pneumonia. Subsequently, Desorption Electrospray Ionization mass spectrometry imaging-based metabolomics screened the differential metabolites affected by dexamethasone. Then, a gene-metabolite interaction network was built to mark functional correlation pathways for exploring integrated information and core biomarkers related to the pathogenesis and etiology of pediatric pneumonia. Further, these were validated by molecular biology and targeted metabolomics. As a result, genes of Cluster of Differentiation19, Fc fragment of IgG receptor IIb, Cluster of Differentiation 22, B-cell linker, Cluster of Differentiation 79B and metabolites of Triethanolamine, Lysophosphatidylcholine(18:1(9Z)), Phosphatidylcholine(16:0/16:0), phosphatidylethanolamine(O-18:1(1Z)/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)) were identified as the critical biomarkers in pediatric pneumonia. B cell receptor signaling pathway and glycerophospholipid metabolism were integrally analyzed as the main pathways of these biomarkers.

Serum samples were collected from DPs, DPs with 8 weeks of KXS treatment (KXS) and healthy controls (HCs), and non-targeted lipidomics was used to analyze the effect of KXS on serum lipid metabolites in DPs. Based on UPLC-Q-TOF/MS technology, differential metabolites were validated in a large sample size. The potential regulatory network of KXS was analyzed by bioinformatic analysis, and the expressions of proteins in serum were verified using western boltting analysis. Moreover, effects of KXS on serum lipid and lipid metabolism-related hormone levels in CUMS rats were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and enzymatic method. We validated that the levels of six serum lipid metabolites (N-Desmethylcitalopram (HMDB14021), PC(14:1(9Z)/24:0) (HMDB07926), PC(P-18:1(11Z)/20:0) (HMDB11281), PC(O-18:0/20:4(8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)) (HMDB13420), PC(16:0/P-18:0) (HMDB07995) and PC(16:0/P-18:1(11Z)) (HMDB07996)) between HC/DP groups and between DP/KXS groups were significantly different. Among these six metabolites, HMDB07995, HMDB07996, HMDB13420 and HMDB11281 were highly sensitive and specific for depression and KXS treatment by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) including MMP2 and MMP9, apolipoproteins (Apo) including APOA1 and APOC1 were up-regulated and apolipoproteins (Apo) including APOB, APOD and APOE, phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP), Paraoxonase 1 (PON1) were down-regulated in DPs, and KXS treatment could reverse these changes. In CUMS rats, KXS could increase the open-field score, sucrose preference and body weight, and reduce immobility time. Furthermore, KXS increased the serum levels of the above-mentioned six metabolites, reduced serum total cholesterol (TCH), triglyceride (TG) and free fatty acid (FFA) levels and increased the serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level in CUMS rats. In addition, leptin and ghrelin were down-regulated by KXS. The results suggested that KXS exerted antidepressant effects by regulating the signaling pathways involved in lipid metabolism disorders. The lipid metabolites might be potential biomarkers of depression and possible targets for KXS-based treatment of depression.	Pc(o-18:1(9z)/18:1(11z))	PUBMED	('INFO', [('INFO', -0.3917788863182068)])

It is a colorless oil although degraded samples can appear yellow. == Use and occurrence == === Additive === Ethyl oleate is used by compounding pharmacies as a vehicle for intramuscular drug delivery, in some cases to prepare the daily doses of progesterone in support of pregnancy. Studies that document the safe use of ethyl oleate in pregnancy for both the mother and the fetus have never been performed. It is regulated as a food additive in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration. Ethyl oleate is used as a solvent for pharmaceutical drug preparations involving lipophilic substances such as steroids. === Chemistry === It also finds use as a lubricant and a plasticizer. Louis Bouveault used ethyl oleate to demonstrate Bouveault–Blanc reduction, producing oleyl alcohol and ethanol, a method which was subsequently refined and published in Organic Syntheses. === Occurrence === Ethyl oleate has been identified as a primer pheromone in honeybees. === Precursor to other chemicals === By the process of ethenolysis, the methyl ester of oleic acid, converts to 1-decene and methyl 9-decenoate: CH3(CH2)7CH=CH(CH2)7CO2Me + CH2=CH2 → CH3(CH2)7CH=CH2 + MeO2C(CH2)7CH=CH2 === Medical aspects === Ethyl oleate is produced by the body during ethanol intoxication. It is one of the fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) produced after ingestion of ethanol. Some research literature implicates FAEEs such as ethyl oleate as the toxic mediators of ethanol in the body (pancreas, liver, heart, and brain).

Structurally, desmosterol has a similar backbone to cholesterol, with the exception of an additional double bond in the structure of desmosterol. The similarity can be seen biologically through the synthesis of cholesterol in the human body, as desmosterol is the immediate precursor to cholesterol in the Bloch pathway. Desmosterol is accumulated in desmosterolosis and undergoes reduction with the catalyst 24-dehydrocholesterol reductase to form cholesterol. In 2014, desmosterol was named the Molecule of the Year 2012 by the International Society for Molecular and Cell Biology and Biotechnology Protocols and Researches (ISMCBBPR). == Background == Desmosterol is classified as a cholestadienol, a subgroup of a wider known group of sterols, which naturally occur in eukaryotes. The presence of desmosterol in oceans and lakes has the potential to diagnose anoxic conditions and to study trends in steroid chemistry during the early stages of diagenesis. Desmosterol has been found in high yields in samples of Rhizosolenia setigera (Brightwell) in Western Svalbard, and from surface sediment off of the Peruvian Shelf sediment-water interface. In 1955, desmosterol was first described and isolated from chick embryo sterol with a 2% yield and was postulated as being a biological precursor to cholesterol by Stokes et al. The first known isolation of desmosterol in invertebrates was published in 1957 by Fagerlund and Idler. This new sterol was isolated in large amounts from balanus glandula, a barnacle species found on the North American Pacific coast. Additionally, small amounts of desmosterol have been found in other crustaceans such as lobster and shrimp in the homarus americanus and pandalus borealis species. This strengthens the conclusion that desmosterol must be created exogenously, as crustaceans have not been seen to biosynthesise sterols. == Biological occurrence == Desmosterol has been largely found within a large population of marine invertebrates. Major sources include barnacles, red algae, annelida, and molluscs. This has led to the idea of an exogenous origin of desmosterol in phytoplankton. In 1967, desmosterol was also identified in large percentages in the red algae Laurencia pinnatifida, Polusiphonia nigrescens, Porphyra purpurea, and Dulse (Rhodymenia palmata) after previously having been undetected. In the 1968 paper by Idler, Saito and Wiseman, dulse samples were analysed and the sterols present were determined by gas liquid chromatography. Samples were collected near Grand Manan Island, New York in 1964 and 1965, and showed a significant difference in the presence of desmosterol. Samples 1 and 2 were from the same source, as were samples 3 and 4, and all samples were harvested at different times. Samples 2, 3, and 4 had the major sterol as desmosterol, compared to sample 1, with the major sterol being cholesterol. This indicates a 70% difference in desmosterol composition in the sterol samples (1 and 2) over a period of one year. There has been no conclusive evidence to show whether seasonal variation of sterols in barnacles occur. == Biosynthesis == There are two major pathways for cholesterol biosynthesis, being the Kandutsch-Russell and Bloch pathways. The Bloch pathway, named after Konrad Bloch, occurs naturally alongside the mevalonate pathway in humans within the cell. The discovery of this pathway led Bloch, joint with Feodor Lynen, to receive a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1964. The award was awarded “for their discoveries concerning the mechanism and regulation of the cholesterol and fatty acid metabolism”. == Preservation == Desmosterol has been seen to be present in marine sponges as a biomarker. However, bacterial symbiont sterol 24-C-methyltransferases is capable of the alkylation of desmosterol to other sponge biomarkers, 24-isopropenylcholesterol, and 24-isopropylidenecholesterol. There is insignificant data which shows that desmosterol has good preservation potential. == Use as a Biomarker == As a biomarker, desmosterol is important for the Chaetoceros calcitrans and R. setigera and N. closterium diatoms as well as Rhodophyceae. However, desmosterol has the potential to be used as a taxonomic marker for diatoms where it exists as the dominant sterol, such as in Rhizosolenia. === Balsfjorden, Northern Norway === Desmosterol has been used as a biomarker for the presence of copepods. The phytoplankton bloom of P. pouchetii and Thalassiosira decipiens resulted in low amounts of desmosterol at maximum chlorophyll levels, indicating the low abundance and efficient removal of copepods in these phytoplankton. === Peruvian Shelf === Diatoms and Silicoflagellates are classes of phytoplankton present in sedimentary material from the sediment water interface in the Peruvian Shelf region. Mineralogical analysis of this sedimentary material suggested large volumes of phytoplankton. Researchers at the University of Bristol examined the sterol composition of these sedimentary rocks which have gone through oxygen depletion, leading to anoxic conditions. These conditions have enhanced the preservation of lipids present during the time of formation, around 1 year prior, and have limited the degradation of these compounds. == Measurement techniques == Desmosterol has seen to be identified most commonly through chemical constants, ozonolysis, infrared spectroscopy, NMR, and mass spectrometry techniques. The use of thin-layer and gas-liquid chromatography to measure desmosterol is less common with the development of more advanced techniques. === GC-MS === Samples from water sources are first extracted and partially purified before analysis. Sterols are commonly first derivatised after purification. Lipid extracts can be separated into their fragments by ionisation using Gas Chromatography followed by Mass Spectroscopy analysis. Desmosterol has a characteristic m/z peak at 384, as seen in the mass spectra. === Ozonolysis === Desmosterol has been identified through ozonolysis of the sample, with the ozonolysis product of desmosterol having a melting point of 128 °C, and an Rf value of 0.31 with paper-chromatography with n-hexane and N,N-dimethyl formamide. The ozonolysis product also has ratios C: 45.68; H: 4.45; N: 23.21. == See also == Cholesterol Triparanol == References ==	Desmosterol	WIKIPEDIA	('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -5.955703818472102e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.0002967320033349097), ('US', 0.0)])
77386.0	('Sphinganine', 'Octadecasphinganine', 'Dihydrosphingosine', 'Erythro-sphinganine', 'Erythro-dihydrosphingosine')	mouse	Safingol is a lyso-sphingolipid protein kinase inhibitor. It has the molecular formula C18H39NO2 and is a colorless solid. Medicinally, safingol has demonstrated promising anticancer potential as a modulator of multi-drug resistance and as an inducer of necrosis. The administration of safingol alone has not been shown to exert a significant effect on tumor cell growth. However, preclinical and clinical studies have shown that combining safingol with conventional chemotherapy agents such as fenretinide, vinblastine, irinotecan and mitomycin C can dramatically potentiate their antitumor effects. In phase I clinical trials, it was found to be safe to co-administer with cisplatin, but caused reversible dose-dependent hepatotoxicity. == Mechanism == The underlying mechanism by which safingol induces cell death is poorly understood. It is believed to exert a variety of inhibitory effects, resulting in a series of cascades that result in accidental necrotic cell death brought about by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mediated by autophagy. Increased autophagic activity has been associated with increased cellular death, although it is unclear if there is any causative relationship between the two. Because autophagy normally plays a pro-survival role by impeding apoptosis, it is curious that it may play a role in cell death following safingol exposure. Safingol competitively competes with phorbol dibutyrate at regulatory domains of the protein kinase C family, inhibiting the activation of such enzymes as PKCβ-I, PKCδ, and PKCε. Safingol can also inhibit phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3k), which is a critical component of the mTOR and MAPK/ERK pathways. Furthermore, safingol, like other sphingolipids, has been found to inhibit glucose uptake. This results in oxidative stress, leading to the generation of ROS that are both time and concentration-dependent. Together, the inhibitory signaling effects (particularly of PKCε and PI3k) and the presence of ROS synergize to induce autophagy. Following autophagic activity, cell death is eventually induced by an as of yet unknown mechanism. Missing from this cellular death are any signs of apoptotic induction such as characteristic changes to nuclear morphology and PARP cleavage. Instead, several hallmarks of necrosis are observed, such as caspase-independent cell death, the loss of plasma membrane integrity, the collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential, and the depletion of intracellular ATP. However, the involvement of RIPK1 has not been observed, suggesting that this necrosis is accidental in nature and not programmed. One potential explanation for safingol’s cytotoxicity is that high concentrations result in ROS-related molecular and cellular damage that is beyond repair. Therefore, autophagy does not directly contribute to death, but is rather a failed attempt to preserve cell viability. However, not only does this hypothesis warrants further testing, but safingol has demonstrated unusual regulatory effects on other pathways capable of regulating autophagy. As expected, a decrease in glucose heightens AMPK phosphorylation. However, an initial increase in phosphorylated mTOR is also observed, which eventually reduces after several hours. The mTOR pathway normally inhibits autophagy, as is induced by heightened glucose uptake. Therefore, decreasing glucose levels should suppress the mTOR pathway, allowing for autophagy. While autophagy is indeed observed following exposure of safingol, it is intriguing that mTOR is activated initially. Modulations in Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, and endonuclease G from mitochondria are also thought to play a role in safingol-induced cellular death by regulating autophagy. Safingol is also a putative inhibitor of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK), which catalyzes the production of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), an important mediator of cancer cell growth, proliferation, invasion, and angiogenesis. This ability further contributes to its anticancer potential. It can also affect the balance of other endogenous sphingolipids, particularly ceramide and dihydroceramide, which have been implicated in autophagic induction and ROS production. == References ==	Sphinganine	WIKIPEDIA	('MEDICAL, ENDOGENOUS', [('MED', -0.03071632795035839), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.07892294228076935), (' END', -0.0006429764907807112), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.5094070477061905e-05), ('US', 0.0)])

It was discovered in 1953 by Alberto Ercoli, S. Di Frisco, and Pietro de Ruggieri, who first isolated the molecule in the horse brain and then demonstrated its presence in the human brain. == Structure == 24S-HC is produced by a hydroxy group substitution at carbon number 24 in cholesterol, catalyzed by the enzyme cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1). == Function == 24S-HC binds to apolipoproteins such as apoE, apoJ, and apoA1 to form HDL-like complexes which can cross the blood–brain barrier more easily than free cholesterol. Thus, 24S-HC production serves as one of several counterbalancing mechanisms for cholesterol synthesis in the brain. After entering general blood circulation and traveling to the liver, 24S-HC can be sulfated, glucuronidated, or converted into bile acids, which can ultimately be excreted. 24S-HC is an agonist of liver X receptors, a class of nuclear receptors that sense oxysterols. In the brain, liver X receptor beta is the primary LXR type, which interacts with 24S-HC. 24S-HC levels sensed by LXRs can regulate the expression of SREBP mRNA and protein, which in turn regulate cholesterol synthesis and fatty acid synthesis. 24S-HC may participate in several aspects of brain development and function, such as axon and dendrite growth or synaptogenesis, as well as acting as a positive allosteric modulator of NMDA receptors. Regulation of 24S-HC metabolism in neurons may play a role in their health and function, as well as their response to injury or disease. Blood plasma levels of 24S-HC may be altered after acute brain injuries such as stroke or in neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis. == References ==	Cerebrosterol	WIKIPEDIA	('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -4.320199877838604e-07), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.0003360582049936056), ('US', 0.0)])

In this study, we investigated the effect of ethyl linoleate on the melanogenesis and the mechanism underlying its action on melanogenesis in B16F10 murine melanoma cells. Our results revealed that ethyl linoleate significantly inhibited melanin content and intracellular tyrosinase activity in α-MSH-induced B16F10 cells, but it did not directly inhibit activity of mushroom tyrosinase. Ethyl linoleate inhibited the expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF), tyrosinase, and tyrosinase related protein 1 (TRP1) in governing melanin pigment synthesis. We observed that ethyl linoleate inhibited phosphorylation of Akt and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) and reduced the level of β-catenin, suggesting that ethyl linoleate inhibits melanogenesis through Akt/GSK3β/β-catenin signal pathway. Therefore, we propose that ethyl linoleate may be useful as a safe whitening agent in cosmetic and a potential therapeutic agent for reducing skin hyperpigmentation in clinics. The endocannabinoid (eCB) system plays an active role in epidermal homeostasis. Phytocannabinoids such as cannabidiol modulate this system but also act through eCB-independent mechanisms. This study evaluated the effects of cannabidiol, bakuchiol (BAK), and ethyl (linoleate/oleate) (ELN) in keratinocytes and reconstituted human epidermis. Molecular docking simulations showed that each compound binds the active site of the eCB carrier FABP5.

Objectives of this research were to quantify the amounts of palmitelaidic acid in beef samples and determine the effect of palmitelaidic acid supplementation on lipogenesis in bovine preadipocytes and adipocytes in vitro. For the first objective, palmitelaidic acid content of LM samples from steers finished on forage or concentrate systems was determined. Palmitelaidic acid in LM samples from forage-finished beef ranged from 10 to 17 mg/100 g of muscle corresponding to 0.52% to 0.65% of total fatty acids. Forage species grazed during finishing, and animal age at harvest also altered palmitelaidic acid concentrations and contents in the LM of forage-finished beef. Palmitelaidic acid concentration of concentrate-finished beef was lower (P < 0.05; 0.25% vs. 0.56%); however, because of increased (P < 0.05) total fatty acid content with concentrate finishing, amount of palmitelaidic acid was similar (P > 0.05) to beef from steers finished on pearl millet and greater (P < 0.05) than those finished on alfalfa. For the second objective, undifferentiated preadipocytes and differentiated adipocytes were supplemented with 0 to 300 μM of palmitelaidic acid. Palmitelaidic acid supplementation reduced (P < 0.05) cell viability of undifferentiated preadipocytes at greater levels (150 and 300 μM) but did not affect (P > 0.05) the viability of differentiated adipocytes. In preadipocytes, palmitelaidic acid increased (P < 0.05) palmitelaidic and trans-11 vaccenic (C18:1 trans-11) acids at high levels of supplementation (300 μM). In adipocytes, palmitelaidic acid supplementation increased (P < 0.05) palmitelaidic acid, trans-11 vaccenic acid, and total fatty acid content. In addition, cis-9, trans-11 CLA also increased (P < 0.05) with palmitelaidic acid supplementation in adipocytes. These results indicate that palmitelaidic acid can be elongated in both preadipocytes and adipocytes and desaturated in adipocytes to generate trans-11 vaccenic acid and cis-9, trans-11 CLA, respectively. Beef products are a source of palmitelaidic acid in the human diet, which can be elongated and desaturated to produce trans-11 vaccenic acid and cis-9, trans-11 CLA. The present study aimed to evaluate the association of plasma trans fatty acids (TFAs) biomarkers with the risk of hypertension. Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES 2009-2010), we conducted a thorough analysis using both the traditional regression model and the Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) model to investigate the associations of individual TFAs and their mixtures with systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and the risk of hypertension in a sample of 1,970 American adults. The concentrations of TFAs were natural logarithms (ln) transformed to approximate a normal distribution. Multivariate linear regression models showed that each 1-unit increase in ln-transformed plasma concentrations of palmitelaidic, elaidic, vaccenic, and linolelaidic acids was associated with separate 2.94-, 3.60-, 2.46- and 4.78-mm Hg and 2.77-, 2.35-, 2.03-, and 3.70- mm Hg increase in SBP and DBP, respectively ( Our findings provide preliminary evidence that plasma TFA concentrations are associated with increased blood pressure and the risk of hypertension in US adults. This study also suggests that linolelaidic acid might exhibit more deleterious effects on hypertension than other TFAs. Further studies should be conducted to validate these results. The effect of different individual TFA isomers on cardiovascular disease (CVD) has been a limited study, especially for stroke. We aimed to investigate the relationships between four major plasma TFA isomer (elaidic, vaccenic, palmitelaidic and linolelaidic acid) concentrations and the risk of CVD, stroke and non-stroke CVD. A cross-sectional study was conducted, utilising a nationally representative sample of US adults in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Among the 3504 participants, 304 participants self-reported CVD history. The highest quintile of elaidic acid intake was associated with a 233% higher CVD risk (p = .010). Adjusted for age, gender and race, palmitelaidic acid was associated with a decreased CVD risk, but the effect size was diminished in a subsequent analysis model. For stroke risk, we failed to identify any associations. In addition to elaidic acid, the health effect of palmitelaidic acid should be paid more attention in the future studies.

EGF stimulates growth of epidermal and epithelial cells. EGF and at least seven other growth factors and their transmembrane receptor kinases play important roles in cell proliferation, survival, adhesion, migration, and differentiation. The EGF receptor (EGFR) family consists of four transmembrane receptors: EGFR (HER1/erbB-1), HER2 (erbB-2/neu), HER3 (erbB-3), and HER4 (erbB-4) (2). HER1, HER3, and HER4 comprise three major functional domains: an extracellular ligand-binding domain, a hydrophobic transmembrane domain, and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. No ligand has been clearly identified for HER2; however, HER2 can be activated as a result of ligand binding to other HER receptors with the formation of receptor homodimers and/or heterodimers (3). HER1 and HER2 are overexpressed on many solid tumor cells such as breast, non-small cell lung, head and neck, and colon cancers (4-6). The high levels of HER1 and HER2 expression on cancer cells are associated with poor patient prognosis because high levels are related to increased proliferation (7-10).

Previously we had shown that, in a p53-dependent model of cell death, ceramide accumulated in a p53-dependent manner [Dbaibo GS, Pushkareva MY, Rachid RA, Alter N, Smyth MJ, Obeid LM, Hannun YA. J Clin Invest 1998;102:329-339]. In the current study, we investigated the biochemical pathways by which ceramide accumulated following p53 up-regulation. In both Molt-4 LXSN leukemia cells exposed to gamma-irradiation and in EB-1 colon cancer cells treated with ZnCl(2), p53 up-regulation led to de novo ceramide synthesis with predominance of N-palmitoylsphingosine (C16-ceramide) synthesis. The activation of the de novo pathway was not associated with increased activity of the key enzyme serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) but rather with the increased activity of ceramide synthase. Furthermore, transcriptional up-regulation of the palmitoyl-specific Lass5 ceramide synthase gene was observed in Molt-4 but not in EB-1 cells. The SPT inhibitor ISP-1 or the ceramide synthase inhibitor fumonisin B1 led to substantial inhibition of ceramide accumulation in response to p53 up-regulation. Other biochemical pathways of ceramide generation such as sphingomyelinase activation were examined and found unlikely to contribute to p53-dependent ceramide formation. These studies indicate that p53 specifically drives de novo ceramide synthesis by activation of a ceramide synthase that favors the synthesis of N-palmitoylsphingosine. The total synthesis of D-erythro-sphingosine (9) was performed by a chirospecific method starting from D-galactose via an azidosphingosine intermediate to give highly homogeneous (>99.9% C18:1) sphingosine base (9) which contained no observable olefin isomerization by product and was demonstrated to be optically pure by a novel method utilizing Mosher's acid. Ceramide (10) was prepared from this sphingosine (9) with highly homogeneous (99.8% C16:0) palmitic acid by two methods. The cerebroside glucosylceramide (23) was the next sphingolipid in this series to be synthesized in a highly homogeneous form.

Though curcumin efficacy is related to its interaction with biomembranes, there are few reports on the effects of curcumin on the lateral motion of lipids, a fundamental process in the cell membrane. Employing the quasielastic neutron scattering technique, we explore the effects of curcumin on the lateral diffusion of the dipalmotylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) membrane. Our investigation is also supported by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering, and calorimetry to understand the interaction between curcumin and the DPPC membrane. It is found that curcumin significantly modulates the packing arrangement and conformations of DPPC lipid, leading to enhanced membrane dynamics. In particular, we find that the presence of curcumin substantially accelerates the DPPC lateral motion in both ordered and fluid phases. The effects are more pronounced in the ordered phase where the lateral diffusion coefficient increases by 23% in comparison to 9% in the fluid phase. Our measurements provide critical insights into molecular mechanisms underlying increased lateral diffusion. In contrast, the localized internal motions of DPPC are barely altered, except for a marginal enhancement observed in the ordered phase. In essence, these findings indicate that curcumin is favorably located at the membrane interface rather than in a transbilayer configuration. Further, the unambiguous evidence that curcumin modulates the membrane dynamics at a molecular level supports a possible action mechanism in which curcumin can act as an allosteric regulator of membrane functionality.

It is the chemical responsible for the brown color of human feces and was originally isolated from feces in 1932. Stercobilin (and related urobilin) can be used as a marker for biochemical identification of fecal pollution levels in rivers. == Metabolism == Stercobilin results from breakdown of the heme moiety of hemoglobin found in erythrocytes (red blood cells). Macrophages break down senescent erythrocytes and break the heme down into biliverdin, which rapidly reduces to free bilirubin. Bilirubin binds tightly to plasma proteins (especially albumin) in the blood stream and is transported to the liver, where it is conjugated with one or two glucuronic acid residues into bilirubin diglucuronide, and secreted into the small intestine as bile. In the small intestine, some bilirubin glucuronide is converted back to bilirubin via bacterial enzymes in the terminal ileum. This bilirubin is further converted to colorless urobilinogen by the bacterial enzyme bilirubin reductase. Urobilinogen that remains in the colon can either be reduced to stercobilinogen and finally oxidized to stercobilin, or it can be directly reduced to stercobilin. Stercobilin is responsible for the brown color of human feces. Stercobilin is then excreted in the feces. == Role in disease == === Obstructive jaundice === In obstructive jaundice, no bilirubin reaches the small intestine, meaning that there is no formation of stercobilinogen. The lack of stercobilin and other bile pigments causes feces to become clay-colored. === Brown pigment gallstones === An analysis of two infants suffering from cholelithiasis observed that a substantial amount of stercobilin was present in brown pigment gallstones. This study suggested that brown pigment gallstones could form spontaneously in infants suffering from bacterial infections of the biliary tract. == Role in treatment of disease == A 1996 study by McPhee et al. suggested that stercobilin and other related pyrrolic pigments — including urobilin, biliverdin, and xanthobilirubic acid — has potential to function as a new class of HIV-1 protease inhibitors when delivered at low micromolar concentrations.

Cold exposure can enhance energy expenditure by activating BAT, and it has been shown to improve nutrient metabolism. These therapies, however, are time consuming and uncomfortable, demonstrating the need for pharmacological interventions. Recently, lipids have been identified that are released from tissues and act locally or systemically to promote insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance; as a class, these lipids are referred to as 'lipokines'. Because BAT is a specialized metabolic tissue that takes up and burns lipids and is linked to systemic metabolic homeostasis, we hypothesized that there might be thermogenic lipokines that activate BAT in response to cold. Here we show that the lipid 12,13-dihydroxy-9Z-octadecenoic acid (12,13-diHOME) is a stimulator of BAT activity, and that its levels are negatively correlated with body-mass index and insulin sensitivity. Using a global lipidomic analysis, we found that 12,13-diHOME was increased in the circulation of humans and mice exposed to cold. Furthermore, we found that the enzymes that produce 12,13-diHOME were uniquely induced in BAT by cold stimulation. The injection of 12,13-diHOME acutely activated BAT fuel uptake and enhanced cold tolerance, which resulted in decreased levels of serum triglycerides. Mechanistically, 12,13-diHOME increased fatty acid (FA) uptake into brown adipocytes by promoting the translocation of the FA transporters FATP1 and CD36 to the cell membrane. These data suggest that 12,13-diHOME, or a functional analog, could be developed as a treatment for metabolic disorders. Lipokines are bioactive compounds, derived from adipose tissue depots, that control several molecular signaling pathways. Recently, 12,13-dihydroxy-9Z-octadecenoic acid (12,13-diHOME), an oxylipin, has gained prominence in the scientific literature. An increase in circulating 12,13-diHOME has been associated with improved metabolic health, and the action of this molecule appears to be mediated by brown adipose tissue (BAT). Scientific evidence indicates that the increase in serum levels of 12,13-diHOME caused by stimuli such as physical exercise and exposure to cold may favor the absorption of fatty acids by brown adipose tissue and stimulate the browning process in white adipose tissue (WAT). Thus, strategies capable of increasing 12,13-diHOME levels may be promising for the prevention and treatment of obesity and metabolic diseases. This review explores the relationship of 12,13-diHOME with brown adipose tissue and its role in the metabolic health context, as well as the signaling pathways involved between 12,13-diHOME and BAT. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is an important tissue for thermogenesis, making it a potential target to decrease the risks of obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease, and recent studies have also identified BAT as an endocrine organ. Although BAT has been implicated to be protective in cardiovascular disease, to this point there are no studies that identify a direct role for BAT to mediate cardiac function. To determine the role of BAT on cardiac function, we utilized a model of BAT transplantation. We then performed lipidomics and identified an increase in the lipokine 12,13-dihydroxy-9Z-octadecenoic acid (12,13-diHOME). We utilized a mouse model with sustained overexpression of 12,13-diHOME and investigated the role of 12,13-diHOME in a nitric oxide synthase type 1 deficient (NOS1 Here, we determined that transplantation of BAT (+BAT) improves cardiac function via the release of the lipokine 12,13-diHOME.

In the in vivo studies, the oral administration of Aca.B to mice showed enhanced bioavailability and dose-dependent repression of the behavioral/cognitive impairment by regulating the cholinergic function, restoring the antioxidant status, attenuating the inflammatory cytokines/mediators and actively enriching neurotropic proteins in the hippocampal regions of the scopolamine-administered mice.

40237.0	('(2e)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-n-[3-({4-[(2e)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)prop-2-enamido]butyl}amino)propyl]prop-2-enamide', 'Dicoumaroyl spermidine')	mouse	 Hydroxycinnamic acid amides are a class of secondary metabolites distributed widely in plants. We have identified two sinapoyl spermidine derivatives, N-((4'-O-glycosyl)-sinapoyl),N'-sinapoylspermidine and N,N'-disinapoylspermidine, which comprise the two major polyamine conjugates that accumulate in Arabidopsis thaliana seed. Using metabolic profiling of knockout mutants to elucidate the functions of members of the BAHD acyltransferase family in Arabidopsis, we have also identified two genes encoding spermidine disinapoyl transferase (SDT) and spermidine dicoumaroyl transferase (SCT) activities. At2g23510, which is expressed mainly in seeds, encodes a spermidine sinapoyl CoA acyltransferase (SDT) that is required for the production of disinapoyl spermidine and its glucoside in Arabidopsis seed. The structurally related BAHD enzyme encoded by At2g25150 is expressed specifically in roots and has spermidine coumaroyl CoA acyltransferase (SCT) activity both in vitro and in vivo. Recently, tea (Camellia sinensis) flowers have attracted increasing interest because of their content of bioactive compounds such as catechins. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of some characteristic compounds in tea flowers. A principal component analysis of metabolites using ultra-performance liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry showed differences in metabolite profile between flowers and leaves of C. sinensis var. Yabukita. Four spermidine derivatives were isolated from tea flowers. One of them was determined as N(1) ,N(5) ,N(10) -tricoumaroyl spermidine based on NMR, MS and UV data. The other three were identified as feruoyl dicoumaroyl spermidine, coumaroyl diferuoyl spermidine and triferuoyl spermidine based on MS(n) data. Tricoumaroyl spermidine as the major spermidine conjugate was not detected in tea leaves. Furthermore, it decreased during floral development and mainly occurred in anthers. This study has provided the first evidence that spermidine-phenolic acid conjugates occur in tea flowers in considerable amounts. Their presence should prompt a reconsideration of the ecological role of tea flowers. From an economic point of view, tea flowers might be suitable as a raw material in the healthcare food and pharmaceutical industries. Phenolamides, so called hydroxycinnamic acid amides, are specialized metabolites produced in higher plants, involved in development, reproduction and serve as defence compounds in biotic interactions. Among them, trihydroxycinnamoyl spermidine derivatives were initially found to be synthetized by a spermidine hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (AtSHT) in Arabidopsis thaliana and to accumulate in the pollen coat. This study reports the identification, in Malus domestica, of an acyltransferase able to complement the sht mutant of Arabidopsis. The quantitative RT-PCR expression profile of MdSHT reveals a specific expression in flowers coordinated with anther development and tapetum cell activities. Three phenolamides including N (1),N (5),N (10)-tricoumaroyl spermidine and N (1),N (5)-dicoumaroyl-N (10)-caffeoyl spermidine identified by LC/MS, were shown to accumulate specifically in pollen grain coat of apple tree. Moreover, in vitro biochemical characterization confirmed MdSHT capacity to synthesize tri-substituted spermidine derivatives with a substrate specificity restricted to p-coumaroyl-CoA and caffeoyl-CoA as an acyl donor. Further investigations of the presence of tri-substituted hydroxycinnamoyl spermidine conjugates in higher plants were performed by targeted metabolic analyses in pollens coupled with bioinformatic analyses of putative SHT orthologues in a wide range of available plant genomes. This work highlights a probable early evolutionary appearance in the common ancestral core Eudicotyledons of a novel enzyme from the BAHD acyltransferase superfamily, dedicated to the synthesis of trihydroxycinnamoyl spermidines in pollen coat. This pathway was maintained in most species; however, recent evolutionary divergences have appeared among Eudicotyledons, such as an organ reallocation of SHT gene expression in Fabales and a loss of SHT in Malvales and Cucurbitales.

106655.0	('All-trans-retinal', 'Retinal', 'Retinaldehyde', 'Vitamin a aldehyde', 'Trans-retinal')	mouse	Retinal (also known as retinaldehyde) is a polyene chromophore. Retinal, bound to proteins called opsins, is the chemical basis of visual phototransduction, the light-detection stage of visual perception (vision). Some microorganisms use retinal to convert light into metabolic energy. One study suggests that approximately three billion years ago, most living organisms on Earth used retinal, rather than chlorophyll, to convert sunlight into energy. Because retinal absorbs mostly green light and transmits purple light, this gave rise to the Purple Earth hypothesis. Retinal itself is considered to be a form of vitamin A when eaten by an animal. There are many forms of vitamin A, all of which are converted to retinal, which cannot be made without them. The number of different molecules that can be converted to retinal varies from species to species. Retinal was originally called retinene, and was renamed after it was discovered to be vitamin A aldehyde. Vertebrate animals ingest retinal directly from meat, or they produce retinal from carotenoids – either from α-carotene or β-carotene – both of which are carotenes. They also produce it from β-cryptoxanthin, a type of xanthophyll. These carotenoids must be obtained from plants or other photosynthetic organisms. No other carotenoids can be converted by animals to retinal. Some carnivores cannot convert any carotenoids at all. The other main forms of vitamin A – retinol and a partially active form, retinoic acid – may both be produced from retinal. Invertebrates such as insects and squid use hydroxylated forms of retinal in their visual systems, which derive from conversion from other xanthophylls. == Vitamin A metabolism == Living organisms produce retinal by irreversible oxidative cleavage of carotenoids. For example: catalyzed by a beta-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase or a beta-carotene 15,15'-dioxygenase. Just as carotenoids are the precursors of retinal, retinal is the precursor of the other forms of vitamin A. Retinal is interconvertible with retinol, the transport and storage form of vitamin A: catalyzed by retinol dehydrogenases (RDHs) and alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs). Retinol is called vitamin A alcohol or, more often, simply vitamin A. Retinal can also be oxidized to retinoic acid: catalyzed by retinal dehydrogenases also known as retinaldehyde dehydrogenases (RALDHs) as well as retinal oxidases. Retinoic acid, sometimes called vitamin A acid, is an important signaling molecule and hormone in vertebrate animals. == Vision == Retinal is a conjugated chromophore. In the Vertebrate eyes, retinal begins in an 11-cis-retinal configuration, which — upon capturing a photon of the correct wavelength — straightens out into an all-trans-retinal configuration. This configuration change pushes against an opsin protein in the retina, which triggers a chemical signaling cascade, which results in perception of light or images by the brain. The absorbance spectrum of the chromophore depends on its interactions with the opsin protein to which it is bound, so that different retinal-opsin complexes will absorb photons of different wavelengths (i.e., different colors of light). === Opsins === Retinal is bound to opsins, which are G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Opsins, like other GPCRs, have seven transmembrane alpha-helices connected by six loops. They are found in the photoreceptor cells in the retina of eye. The opsin in the vertebrate rod cells is rhodopsin. The rods form disks, which contain the rhodopsin molecules in their membranes and which are entirely inside of the cell. The N-terminus head of the molecule extends into the interior of the disk, and the C-terminus tail extends into the cytoplasm of the cell. The opsins in the cone cells are OPN1SW, OPN1MW, and OPN1LW. The cones form incomplete disks that are part of the plasma membrane, so that the N-terminus head extends outside of the cell. In opsins, retinal binds covalently to a lysine in the seventh transmembrane helix through a Schiff base. Forming the Schiff base linkage involves removing the oxygen atom from retinal and two hydrogen atoms from the free amino group of lysine, giving H2O. Retinylidene is the divalent group formed by removing the oxygen atom from retinal, and so opsins have been called retinylidene proteins. Opsins are prototypical G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Cattle rhodopsin, the opsin of the rod cells, was the first GPCR to have its amino acid sequence and 3D-structure (via X-ray crystallography) determined. Cattle rhodopsin contains 348 amino acid residues. Retinal binds as chromophore at Lys296. This lysine is conserved in almost all opsins, only a few opsins have lost it during evolution. Opsins without the retinal binding lysine are not light sensitive. Such opsins may have other functions. Although mammals use retinal exclusively as the opsin chromophore, other groups of animals additionally use four chromophores closely related to retinal: 3,4-didehydroretinal (vitamin A2), (3R)-3-hydroxyretinal, (3S)-3-hydroxyretinal (both vitamin A3), and (4R)-4-hydroxyretinal (vitamin A4). Many fish and amphibians use 3,4-didehydroretinal, also called dehydroretinal. With the exception of the dipteran suborder Cyclorrhapha (the so-called higher flies), all insects examined use the (R)-enantiomer of 3-hydroxyretinal. The (R)-enantiomer is to be expected if 3-hydroxyretinal is produced directly from xanthophyll carotenoids. Cyclorrhaphans, including Drosophila, use (3S)-3-hydroxyretinal. Firefly squid have been found to use (4R)-4-hydroxyretinal. === Visual cycle === The visual cycle is a circular enzymatic pathway, which is the front-end of phototransduction. It regenerates 11-cis-retinal. For example, the visual cycle of mammalian rod cells is as follows: all-trans-retinyl ester + H2O → 11-cis-retinol + fatty acid; RPE65 isomerohydrolases; 11-cis-retinol + NAD+ → 11-cis-retinal + NADH + H+; 11-cis-retinol dehydrogenases; 11-cis-retinal + aporhodopsin → rhodopsin + H2O; forms Schiff base linkage to lysine, -CH=N+H-; rhodopsin + hν → metarhodopsin II (i.e., 11-cis photoisomerizes to all-trans): (rhodopsin + hν → photorhodopsin → bathorhodopsin → lumirhodopsin → metarhodopsin I → metarhodopsin II); metarhodopsin II + H2O → aporhodopsin + all-trans-retinal; all-trans-retinal + NADPH + H+ → all-trans-retinol + NADP+; all-trans-retinol dehydrogenases; all-trans-retinol + fatty acid → all-trans-retinyl ester + H2O; lecithin retinol acyltransferases (LRATs). Steps 3, 4, 5, and 6 occur in rod cell outer segments; Steps 1, 2, and 7 occur in retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells. RPE65 isomerohydrolases are homologous with beta-carotene monooxygenases; the homologous ninaB enzyme in Drosophila has both retinal-forming carotenoid-oxygenase activity and all-trans to 11-cis isomerase activity. == Microbial rhodopsins == All-trans-retinal is also an essential component of microbial opsins such as bacteriorhodopsin, channelrhodopsin, and halorhodopsin, which are important in bacterial and archaeal anoxygenic photosynthesis. In these molecules, light causes the all-trans-retinal to become 13-cis retinal, which then cycles back to all-trans-retinal in the dark state. These proteins are not evolutionarily related to animal opsins and are not GPCRs; the fact that they both use retinal is a result of convergent evolution. == History == The American biochemist George Wald and others had outlined the visual cycle by 1958. For his work, Wald won a share of the 1967 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine with Haldan Keffer Hartline and Ragnar Granit. == See also == Purple Earth hypothesis Sensory nervous system Visual perception Visual phototransduction == References == == Further reading == == External links == First Steps of Vision - National Health Museum Vision and Light-Induced Molecular Changes Retinal Anatomy and Visual Capacities Retinal, Imperial College v-chemlib	All-trans-retinal	WIKIPEDIA	('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.03781263157725334), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -2.1008713702030946e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.0002615742268972099), (' FOOD', -4.060365608893335e-05)])
35599.0	('Adipic acid', 'Hexanedioic acid', 'Adipinic acid', 'Acifloctin', 'Acinetten')	mouse	"Adipic acid or hexanedioic acid is the organic compound with the formula (CH2)4(COOH)2. From an industrial perspective, it is the most important dicarboxylic acid: about 2.5 billion kilograms of this white crystalline powder are produced annually, mainly as a precursor for the production of nylon. Adipic acid otherwise rarely occurs in nature, but it is known as manufactured E number food additive E355. Salts and esters of adipic acid are known as adipates. == Preparation and reactivity == Adipic acid is produced by oxidation of a mixture of cyclohexanone and cyclohexanol, which is called KA oil, an abbreviation of ketone-alcohol oil. Nitric acid is the oxidant. The pathway is multistep. Early in the reaction, the cyclohexanol is converted to the ketone, releasing nitrous acid: HOCH(CH2)5 + HNO3 → O=C(CH2)5 + HNO2 + H2O The cyclohexanone is then nitrosated, setting the stage for the scission of the C-C bond: HNO2 + HNO3 → [NO+][NO3]− + H2O O=C(CH2)5 + NO+ → O=C(CHNO)(CH2)4 + H+ Side products of the method include glutaric and succinic acids. Nitrous oxide is produced in about one to one mole ratio to the adipic acid, as well, via the intermediacy of a nitrolic acid. Related processes start from cyclohexanol, which is obtained from the hydrogenation of phenol. === Alternative methods of production === Several methods have been developed by carbonylation of butadiene. For example, the hydrocarboxylation proceeds as follows: CH2=CH−CH=CH2 + 2 CO + 2 H2O → HO2C(CH2)4CO2H Another method is oxidative cleavage of cyclohexene using hydrogen peroxide. The waste product is water. Auguste Laurent discovered adipic acid in 1837 by oxidation of various fats with nitric acid via sebacic acid and gave it the current name because of that (ultimately from Latin adeps, adipis – ""animal fat""; cf. adipose tissue). === Reactions === Adipic acid is a dibasic acid (it has two acidic groups). The pKa values for their successive deprotonations are 4.41 and 5.41. With the carboxylate groups separated by four methylene groups, adipic acid is suited for intramolecular condensation reactions. Upon treatment with barium hydroxide at elevated temperatures, it undergoes ketonization to give cyclopentanone. == Uses == About 60% of the 2.5 billion kg of adipic acid produced annually is used as monomer for the production of nylon by a polycondensation reaction with hexamethylene diamine forming nylon 66. Other major applications also involve polymers; it is a monomer for production of polyurethane and its esters are plasticizers, especially in PVC. === In medicine === Adipic acid has been incorporated into controlled-release formulation matrix tablets to obtain pH-independent release for both weakly basic and weakly acidic drugs. It has also been incorporated into the polymeric coating of hydrophilic monolithic systems to modulate the intragel pH, resulting in zero-order release of a hydrophilic drug. The disintegration at intestinal pH of the enteric polymer shellac has been reported to improve when adipic acid was used as a pore-forming agent without affecting release in the acidic media. Other controlled-release formulations have included adipic acid with the intention of obtaining a late-burst release profile. === In foods === Small but significant amounts of adipic acid are used as a food ingredient as a flavorant and gelling aid. It is used in some calcium carbonate antacids to make them tart. As an acidulant in baking powders, it avoids the undesirable hygroscopic properties of tartaric acid. Adipic acid, rare in nature, does occur naturally in beets, but this is not an economical source for commerce compared to industrial synthesis. == Safety == Adipic acid, like most carboxylic acids, is a mild skin irritant. It is mildly toxic, with a median lethal dose of 3600 mg/kg for oral ingestion by rats. == Environmental == The production of adipic acid is linked to emissions of N2O, a potent greenhouse gas and cause of stratospheric ozone depletion. At adipic acid producers DuPont and Rhodia (now Invista and Solvay, respectively), processes have been implemented to catalytically convert the nitrous oxide to innocuous products: 2 N2O → 2 N2 + O2 == Adipate salts and esters == The anionic (HO2C(CH2)4CO2−) and dianionic (−O2C(CH2)4CO2−) forms of adipic acid are referred to as adipates. An adipate compound is a carboxylate salt or ester of the acid. Some adipate salts are used as acidity regulators, including: Sodium adipate (E number E356) Potassium adipate (E357) Some adipate esters are used as plasticizers, including: Bis(2-ethylhexyl) adipate Dioctyl adipate Dimethyl adipate == References == == Appendix == U.S. FDA citations – GRAS (21 CFR 184.1009), Indirect additive (21 CFR 175.300, 21 CFR 175.320, 21 CFR 176.170, 21 CFR 176.180, 21 CFR 177.1200, 21 CFR 177.1390, 21 CFR 177.1500, 21 CFR 177.1630, 21 CFR 177.1680, 21 CFR 177.2420, 21 CFR 177.2600) European Union Citations – Decision 1999/217/EC – Flavoing Substance; Directive 95/2/EC, Annex IV – Permitted Food Additive; 2002/72/EC, Annex A – Authorized monomer for Food Contact Plastics == External links == International Chemical Safety Card 0369 SIDS Initial Assessment Report for Adipic acid from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) adipic acid on chemicalland"	Adipic acid	WIKIPEDIA	('INDUSTRIAL, FOOD', [('IND', -0.20144031941890717), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -8.537868779967539e-06)])
111392.0	('Arachidonic acid', 'Arachidonate', '(5z,8z,11z,14z)-icosa-5,8,11,14-tetraenoic acid', 'Immunocytophyte', '(all-z)-5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid')	mouse	"Arachidonic acid (AA, sometimes ARA) is a polyunsaturated omega−6 fatty acid 20:4(ω−6), or 20:4(5,8,11,14). If its precursors or diet contains linoleic acid it is formed by biosynthesis and can be deposited in animal fats. It is a precursor in the formation of leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and thromboxanes. Together with omega−3 fatty acids and other omega−6 fatty acids, arachidonic acid provides energy for body functions, contributes to cell membrane structure, and participates in the synthesis of eicosanoids, which have numerous roles in physiology as signaling molecules. Its name derives from the ancient Greek neologism arachis 'peanut', although peanut oil does not contain any arachidonic acid. Arachidonate is the name of the derived carboxylate anion (conjugate base of the acid), salts, and some esters. == Chemistry == In chemical structure, arachidonic acid is a carboxylic acid with a 20-carbon chain and four cis-double bonds; the first double bond is located at the sixth carbon from the omega end. Some chemistry sources define 'arachidonic acid' to designate any of the eicosatetraenoic acids. However, almost all writings in biology, medicine, and nutrition limit the term to all cis-5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid. == Biology == Arachidonic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid present in the phospholipids (especially phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylinositides) of membranes of the body's cells, and is abundant in the brain, muscles, and liver. Skeletal muscle is an especially active site of arachidonic acid retention, accounting for roughly 10–20% of the phospholipid fatty acid content typically. In addition to being involved in cellular signaling as a lipid second messenger involved in the regulation of signaling enzymes, such as PLC-γ, PLC-δ, and PKC-α, -β, and -γ isoforms, arachidonic acid is a key inflammatory intermediate and can also act as a vasodilator. (Note separate synthetic pathways, as described in section below.) == Biosynthesis and cascade in humans == Arachidonic acid is freed from phospholipid by hydrolysis, catalyzed by the phospholipase A2 (PLA2). Arachidonic acid for signaling purposes appears to be derived by the action of group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2, 85 kDa), whereas inflammatory arachidonic acid is generated by the action of a low-molecular-weight secretory PLA2 (sPLA2, 14-18 kDa). Arachidonic acid is a precursor to a wide range of eicosanoids: The enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (i.e. prostaglandin G/H synthase 1 and 2 [⁠PTGS1 and PTGS2]) convert arachidonic acid to prostaglandin G2 and prostaglandin H2, which in turn may be converted to various prostaglandins, to prostacyclin, to thromboxanes, and to the 17-carbon product of thromboxane metabolism of prostaglandin G2/H2, 12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid (12-HHT). The enzyme 5-lipoxygenase catalyzes the oxidation of arachidonic acid to 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE), which in turn converts to various leukotrienes (i.e., leukotriene B4, leukotriene C4, leukotriene D4, and leukotriene E4) as well as to 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) which may then be further metabolized to 5-HETE's more potent 5-keto analog, 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE) (also see 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid). The enzymes 15-lipoxygenase-1 (ALOX15) and 15-lipoxygenase-2 (ALOX15B). ALOX15B catalyzes the oxidation of arachidonic acid to 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HPETE), which may then be further converted to 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) and lipoxins; 15-Lipoxygenase-1 may also further metabolize 15-HPETE to eoxins in a pathway analogous to (and presumably using the same enzymes as used in) the pathway which metabolizes 5-HPETE to leukotrienes. The enzyme 12-lipoxygenase (ALOX12) catalyzes oxidation of arachidonic acid to 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HPETE), which may then be metabolized to 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) and to hepoxilins. Arachidonic acid is also a precursor to anandamide. Some arachidonic acid is converted into hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) by epoxygenase. The production of these derivatives and their actions in the body are collectively known as the ""arachidonic acid cascade""; see Essential fatty acid interactions and the enzyme and metabolite linkages given in the previous paragraph for more details. === PLA2 activation === PLA2, in turn, is activated by ligand binding to receptors, including: 5-HT2 receptors mGLUR1 bFGF receptor IFN-α receptor IFN-γ receptor Furthermore, any agent increasing intracellular calcium may cause activation of some forms of PLA2. === PLC activation === Alternatively, arachidonic acid may be cleaved from phospholipids after phospholipase C (PLC) cleaves off the inositol trisphosphate group, yielding diacylglycerol (DAG), which subsequently is cleaved by DAG lipase to yield arachidonic acid. Receptors that activate this pathway include: A1 receptor D2 receptor α2 adrenergic receptor 5-HT1 receptor PLC may also be activated by MAP kinase. Activators of this pathway include PDGF and FGF. == In the body == === Cell membranes === Along with other omega−6 and omega−3 fatty acids, arachidonic acid contributes to the structure of cell membranes. When incorporated into phospholipids, the omega fatty acids affect cell membrane properties, such as permeability and the activity of enzymes and cell-signaling mechanisms. === Brain === Arachidonic acid, one of the most abundant fatty acids in the brain, is present in similar quantities to docosahexaenoic acid, with the two accounting for about 20% of brain fatty-acid content. Arachidonic acid is involved in the early neurological development of infants. == Dietary supplement == Arachidonic acid is marketed as a dietary supplement. A 2019 review of clinical studies investigating the potential health effects of arachidonic acid supplementation of up to 1500 mg per day on human health found there were no clear benefits. There were no adverse effects in adults of using high daily doses (1500 mg) of arachidonic acid on several biomarkers of blood chemistry, immune function, and inflammation. A 2009 review indicated that consumption of 5−10% of food energy from omega−6 fatty acids including arachidonic acid may reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases compared to lower intakes. A 2014 meta-analysis of possible associations between heart disease risk and individual fatty acids reported a significantly reduced risk of heart disease with higher levels of EPA, DHA, and arachidonic acid. == See also == == References == == External links == Arachidonic+Acid at the U.S. National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)"	Arachidonic acid	WIKIPEDIA	('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.0023537646047770977), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.2664456789934775e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.0024764856789261103), (' FOOD', -6.630610641877865e-06)])

The difference in phase transitions and thermodynamic quantities of the transition was hardly observed between LMV and GMV used here. On the contrary, the Prodan fluorescence in the bilayer membranes changed depending on the size of vesicles as well as on the phase states. From the second derivative of fluorescence spectra, the three-dimensional image plots in which we can see the location of Prodan in the bilayer membrane as blue valleys were constructed for LMV and GMV under atmospheric pressure. The following characteristic behavior was found: (1) the Prodan molecules in GMV can be distributed to not only adjacent glycerol backbone region, but also near bulk-water region in the lamellar gel or ripple gel phase; (2) the blue valleys of GMV became deeper than those of LMV because of the greater surface density of the Prodan molecules per unit area of GMV than LMV; (3) the liquid crystalline phase of the bilayer excludes the Prodan molecules to a more hydrophilic region at the membrane surface with an increase in vesicle size; (4) the accurate information as to the phase transitions is gradually lost with increasing vesicle size. Under the high-pressure condition, the difference in Prodan fluorescence between LMV and GMV was essentially the same as the difference under atmospheric pressure except for the existence of the pressure-induced interdigitated gel phase. Further, we found that Prodan fluorescence spectra in the interdigitated gel phase were especially affected by the size of vesicles. This study revealed that the Prodan molecules can move around the headgroup region by responding not only to the phase state but also to the vesicle size, and they become a useful membrane probe, detecting important membrane properties such as the packing stress. We investigated the phase behavior of cholesterol/diheptadecanoylphosphatidylcholine (C17:0-PC) binary bilayer membrane as a function of the cholesterol composition (X(ch)) by fluorescence spectroscopy using 6-propionyl-2-(dimethylamino)naphthalene (Prodan) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The fluorescence spectra showed that the wavelength at the maximum intensity (lambda(max)) changed depending on the bilayer state: ca. 440 nm for the lamellar gel (L'(beta) or L(beta)) and the liquid ordered (L(o)) phases and ca. 490 nm for the liquid-crystalline (L(alpha)) phase. The transition temperatures were determined from the temperature dependence of lambda(max) and endothermic peaks of the DSC thermograms. Both measurements showed that the pre- and main transition disappear around X(ch)=0.05 and 0.30, respectively. The constructed temperature-X(ch) phase diagram resembled a typical phase diagram for a eutectic binary mixture containing a peritectic point. The presence of a peritectic point at X(ch)=0.15 suggested that a complex of cholesterol and C17:0-PC is stoichiometrically formed in the gel phase. Consideration based on the hexagonal lattice model revealed that the compositions of 0.05 and 0.15 correspond to the bilayer states where cholesterol molecules are regularly distributed in different ways. The former is nearly equal to the composition for the membrane occupied entirely with Units (1:18), composed of a cholesterol and 18 surrounding C17:0-PC molecules within the next-next nearest neighbor sites. The latter is represented by a Unit (1:6), including a cholesterol and 6 surrounding C17:0-PC molecules. Further, the disappearance of the main transition at X(ch)=0.30 indicates that the pure L(o) phase can exist in X(ch)>0.30. The eutectic behavior observed in the phase diagram was explainable in terms of phase separation between two different types of regions with different types of regular distributions of cholesterol. To examine the thermotropic phase behavior of various mixed-chain phosphatidylcholines in excess water and to compare it with the known behavior of identical-chain phosphatidylcholines, we have carried out high-resolution differential scanning calorimetric (DSC) studies on aqueous dispersions of 10 different mixed-chain phosphatidylcholines. These lipids, C(16):C(18)PC, C(18):C(16)PC, C(15):C(19)PC, C(19):C(15)PC, C(14):C(20)PC, C(20):C(14)PC, C(13):C(21)PC, C(21):C(13)PC, C(12):C(22)PC, and C(22):C(12)PC, have a common molecular weight which is the same as that of C(17):C(17)PC, an identical-chain phosphatidylcholine with a molecular weight of 762.2. When the values of any of the thermodynamic parameters (Tm, delta H, and delta S) of the mixed-chain phosphatidylcholines and C(17):C(17)PC are plotted against the normalized chain-length difference (delta C/CL), a linear function with negative slope is obtained provided that the value of delta C/CL is within the range of 0.09-0.4. The linear relationship suggests that these mixed-chain phospholipids are packed in the gel-state bilayer similar to the bilayer structure of C(17):C(17)PC at T less than Tm; however, the negative slope suggests that the conformational statistics of the hydrocarbon chain and the lateral lipid-lipid interactions of these phosphatidylcholines in the gel-state bilayer are perturbed proportionally by a progressive increase in the chain-length inequivalence between the two acyl chains within each lipid molecule. When the value of delta C/CL for mixed-chain phosphatidylcholines reaches the range of 0.44-0.55, the thermotropic phase behavior deviates markedly from that of less asymmetric phosphatidylcholines, suggesting that these highly asymmetric lipids are packed into mixed interdigitated bilayers at T less than Tm. The heating and cooling pathways of aqueous dispersions prepared from the 10 mixed-chain phospholipids are also discussed.

Respective peptide backbones adopt an extended conformation with the side-chains of Phe and Met residues being arranged below and above the backbone chains. Contrary to the sheet structure most frequently observed in the crystal packing of the extended peptide conformations, three independent molecules lie spirally along the c-axis and form a pin-wheel-like crystal packing. The sheet structures formed by two of three independent molecules are almost at right angles to the backbone of the remaining molecule.

Natural ent-kaurane diterpenoids have been found to bind glutathione (GSH) and sulfhydryl group in antioxidant enzymes covalently, which leads to the destruction of intracellular redox homeostasis. Therefore, redox resetting destruction by ent-kaurane diterpenoids may emerge as a viable strategy for cancer therapy. In this study, we isolated 30 ent-kaurane diterpenoids including 20 new samples from Chinese liverworts Jungermannia tetragona Lindenb and studied their specific targets and possible application in cancer drug resistance through redox resetting destruction. 11β-hydroxy-ent-16-kaurene-15-one (23) possessed strong inhibitory activity against several cancer cell lines. Moreover, compound 23 induced both apoptosis and ferroptosis through increasing cellular ROS levels in HepG2 cells. ROS accumulation induced by compound 23 was caused by inhibition of antioxidant systems through targeting peroxiredoxin I/II (Prdx I/II) and depletion of GSH.

A possible strategy to prevent the progression of this disease is the inhibition of protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a major negative regulator in the insulin and leptin signalling pathway. Phellodendri amurensis cortex is a well-known Asian herbal drug traditionally used as antiphlogistic, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory agent, and its efficacy against diabetes-related symptoms is reported as well. However, information regarding active principle(s) or the molecular mode of action was scarce. By bioguided isolation using an IN VITRO enzyme assay with human recombinant PTP1B, (9 Z)-octadec-9-enoic acid (oleic acid) could be identified as a major PTP1B inhibitor in the bark of Phellodendron amurENSE Rupr. (Rutaceae); it showed an IC₅₀ value of 6.2 µM. Consistent with this inhibition of PTP1B, oleic acid was capable of enhancing insulin signalling in wild-type, but not PTP1B knockout fibroblasts. By testing a series of other fatty acids of different chain length and degree of saturation, their general PTP1B-inhibitory potential in the micromolar range was observed. More pronounced effects were associated with a longer carbon backbone and saturation of the double bonds. Therefore, our work provides first scientific evidences for the antidiabetic properties of P. amurense via a new target, effects which seem to be explainable by oleic acid. The discovery of a PTP1B inhibition by many fatty acids also adds a novel facet to the pharmacological properties of a class of compounds that is found in many food items in considerable amount and triggers speculation over their possible involvement in the feedback regulation of cellular fatty acid synthesis. A capillary electrophoresis (CE)-capacitively coupled contactless conductivity detection (C(4)D) method for the simultaneous separation of eleven underivatized fatty acids (FAs), namely, lauric, myristic, tridecanoic (internal standard), pentadecanoic, palmitic, stearic, oleic, elaidic, linoleic, linolenic and arachidic acids is described. The separation was carried out in normal polarity mode at 20 °C, 30 kV and using hydrodynamic injection (50 mbar for 1 s). The separation was achieved in a bare fused-silica capillary (70 cm × 75 μm i.d.) using a background electrolyte of methyl-β-cyclodextrin (~6 mM) and heptakis-(2,3,6-tri-O-methyl)-β-cyclodextrin (~8 mM) dissolved in a mixture of Na2HPO4/KH2PO4 (5 mM, pH 7.4):ACN:MeOH:n-octanol (3:4:2.5:0.5, v/v/v/v). C(4)D parameters were set at fixed amplitude of 100 V and frequency of 1000 kHz. The developed method was validated. Calibration curves of the ten FAs were well correlated (r(2)>0.99) within the range of 5-250 μg mL(-1) for lauric acid, and 3-250 μg mL(-1) for the other FAs. The method was simple and sensitive with detection limits (S/N=3) of 0.9-1.9 μg mL(-1) and good relative standard deviations of intra- and inter-day for migration times and peak areas (≤9.7%) were achieved. The method was applied to the determination of FAs in margarine samples. The proposed method offers distinct advantages over the GC and HPLC methods, especially in terms of simplicity (without derivatization) and sensitivity. A new series of octadec-9-enoic acid schiff base entities (S1-S30) were designed and synthesized targeting peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma for agonist action. Molinspiration software (online) was used to estimate drug like molecular properties of the metabolites.

92524.0	('Anandamide', 'Arachidonylethanolamide', 'Arachidonoyl ethanolamide', 'N-arachidonoylethanolamine', 'N-arachidonoyl ethanolamine')	mouse	"Anandamide (ANA), also referred to as N-arachidonoylethanolamine (AEA) is a fatty acid neurotransmitter belonging to the fatty acid derivative group known as N-acylethanolamine (NAE). Anandamide takes its name from the Sanskrit word ananda (आनन्द), meaning ""joy, bliss, delight,"" plus amide. Anandamide, the first discovered endocannabinoid, engages with the body's endocannabinoid system by binding to the same cannabinoid receptors that THC found in cannabis acts on. Anandamide can be found within tissues in a wide range of animals. It has also been found in plants, such as the cacao tree. Anandamide is derived from the non-oxidative metabolism of arachidonic acid, an essential omega-6 fatty acid. It is synthesized from N-arachidonoyl phosphatidylethanolamine by multiple pathways. It is degraded primarily by the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) enzyme, which converts anandamide into ethanolamine and arachidonic acid. As such, inhibitors of FAAH lead to elevated anandamide levels and are being pursued for possible therapeutic use. == Discovery == Anandamide was discovered by Raphael Mechoulam and fellow coworkers in 1992. This was the first marijuana-like substance produced by the human body to be observed. By examining a pig brain and canine gut, they were able to isolate ANA using mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. ANA works within the system of the brain associated with the feeling of reward, and as such, has been the topic of many research studies. Since the 1992 findings, many studies have been completed to examine ANA further, including research on behavioral and molecular effects. == Research == According to in vitro research, anandamide effects are mediated primarily by CB1 cannabinoid receptors in the central nervous system, and CB2 cannabinoid receptors in the periphery. The latter appear to be involved in functions of the immune system. Cannabinoid receptors were originally discovered as sensitive to Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC, commonly called THC), which is the primary psychoactive cannabinoid found in cannabis. The discovery of anandamide came from research into CB1 and CB2, as it was inevitable that a naturally occurring (endogenous) chemical would be found to affect these receptors. Anandamide is under research for its potential involvement in the implantation of the early stage embryo in its blastocyst form into the uterus. Therefore, cannabinoids such as Δ9-THC might influence processes during the earliest stages of human pregnancy. Peak plasma anandamide occurs at ovulation and positively correlates with peak estradiol and gonadotrophin levels, suggesting that these may be involved in the regulation of anandamide levels. Subsequently, anandamide has been proposed as a biomarker of infertility, but so far lacks any predictive values in order to be used clinically. === Behavior === Both the CB1 and CB2 receptors (the binding site of anandamide) are under research for a possible role in positive and negative interpretation of environment and setting. The binding relationship of anandamide and the CB1/CB2 may affect neurotransmission of dopamine, serotonin, GABA, and glutamate. Endocannabinoids may disturb homeostasis in several ways: by enhancing hunger sensations, encouraging increased food intake, and shifting energy balance towards energy storage. A resultant decrease in energy expenditure is observed. Cortical glutamatergic transmission may be modulated by endocannabinoids during stress and fear habituation. === Obesity and liver disease === Blockade of CB1 receptors was found to improve lipid resistance and lipid profile in obese subjects with type 2 diabetes. Elevated anandamide levels are found in people with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and liver fibrosis. === Topical effects === The American Academy of Dermatology has named topical anandamide a promising therapy for cutaneous lupus erythematosus. == Biosynthesis == In humans, anandamide is biosynthesized from N-arachidonoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (NAPE). In turn, NAPE arises by transfer of arachidonic acid from lecithin to the free amine of cephalin through an N-acyltransferase enzyme. Anandamide synthesis from NAPE occurs via multiple pathways and includes enzymes such as phospholipase A2, phospholipase C and N-acetylphosphatidylethanolamine-hydrolysing phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD), with other key enzymes yet to be identified. The crystal structure of NAPE-PLD in complex with phosphatidylethanolamine and deoxycholate shows how the cannabinoid anandamide is generated from membrane N-acylphosphatidylethanolamines (NAPEs), and reveals that bile acids – which are mainly involved in the absorption of lipids in the small intestine – modulate its biogenesis. == Metabolism == Endogenous anandamide is present at very low levels and has a very short half-life due to the action of the enzyme fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH), which breaks it down into free arachidonic acid and ethanolamine. Studies of piglets show that dietary levels of arachidonic acid and other essential fatty acids affect the levels of anandamide and other endocannabinoids in the brain. High fat diet feeding in mice increases levels of anandamide in the liver and increases lipogenesis. Anandamide may be relevant to the development of obesity, at least in rodents. Paracetamol (known as acetaminophen in the US and Canada) is metabolically combined with arachidonic acid by FAAH to form AM404. This metabolite is a potent agonist at the TRPV1 vanilloid receptor, a weak agonist at both CB1 and CB2 receptors, and an inhibitor of anandamide reuptake. Consequently, anandamide levels in the body and brain are elevated. Thus, paracetamol acts as a pro-drug for a cannabimimetic metabolite, which may be partially or fully responsible for its analgesic effects. Black pepper contains the alkaloid guineesine, which is an anandamide reuptake inhibitor. It may therefore increase anandamide's physiological effects. == Transport == Endocannabinoid transporters for anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol include the heat shock proteins (Hsp70s) and fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs). Anandamide shows a preference for binding to cholesterol and ceramide over other membrane lipids. Cholesterol acts as a binding partner for anandamide. Initially, a hydrogen bond facilitates their interaction. Following this, anandamide is drawn towards the membrane interior, where it forms a molecular complex with cholesterol. This process involves a conformational adaptation of anandamide to the apolar membrane environment. Subsequently, the anandamide-cholesterol complex is directed to the cannabinoid receptor (CB1) and then exits. == See also == Virodhamine == References == == External links =="	Anandamide	WIKIPEDIA	('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('END', -2.7491250875755213e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -0.00038038729690015316), ('US', 0.0), (',', -0.6933353543281555), (' FOOD', -0.00792659167200327), (',', -0.10029756277799606), (' PERSONAL', -0.003236536169424653), (' CARE', 0.0)])

SUCLA2 is one of several nuclear-encoded genes that can cause encephalomyopathy accompanied by mitochondrial DNA depletion. The disorder usually manifests in early childhood and leads to early death. The gene encodes one of the subunits of succinyl-CoA synthase, the enzyme that catalyzes the reversible conversion of substrates succinyl-CoA and ADP to products succinate and ATP in the tricarboxylic acid pathway. Thirty-two individuals harboring mutations in SUCLA2 have so far been reported, and five different mutations were observed among these individuals. Here we report identification of a novel mutation in SUCLA2 in two cousins affected with encephalomyopathy. The novel mutation causes p.Asp251Asn; the affected amino acid is likely positioned within the ATP-grasp domain of the encoded protein. As previously reported in other patients, we did not observe elevation of methylmalonic acid, the biochemical hallmark of patients with mutations in SUCLA2. We instead found elevated levels of succinylcarnitine. Methylmalonic aciduria (MMA) is one of the most frequent organic acidurias, a class of diseases caused by enzymatic defects mainly involved in the catabolism of branched-chain amino acids. Recently, mild MMA and C4-dicarboxylyl-carnitine (C4DC-C) accumulation have been reported in patients carrying mutation in genes encoding the α-subunit (SUCLG1) and the β-subunit (SUCLA2) of the ADP-forming succinyl-CoA synthetase (SCS). We developed a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method to quantify in dried blood spot the two isobaric compounds of C4DC-C, succinyl-carnitine and methylmalonyl-carnitine, to allow the differential diagnosis between classical MMA and SCS-related defects. This method, with an easy liquid-phase extraction and derivatization procedure, has been validated to demonstrate the specificity, linearity, recovery, lowest limit of quantification (LLOQ), accuracy and precision for quantitative determination of blood succinyl-carnitine and methylmalonyl-carnitine. The assay was linear over a concentration range of 0.025-10 μmol/L and achieved the LLOQ of 0.025 μmol/L for both metabolites. The average slope, intercept, and coefficient of linear regression (r(2)) were respectively: 0.3389 (95% confidence interval 0.2888-0.3889), 0.0113 (95% confidence interval -0.0157 to 0.0384), 0.9995 (95% confidence interval 0.9990-1.0000) for succinyl-carnitine and 0.5699 (95% confidence interval 0.5263-0.6134), 0.0319 (95% confidence interval -0.0038 to 0.0677), 0.9997 (95% confidence interval 0.9995-1.0000) for methylmalonyl-carnitine. Within-day and between-day coefficients of variation (CV) were 1.94% and 3.19% for succinyl-carnitine and 3.21%, and 2.56 for methylmalonyl-carnitine.

Two weeks later, the dilator function of retinal arterioles was assessed. Compared with non-diabetic rats, the dilator responses of retinal arterioles induced by intravitreal injection of NMDA and NOR3, an NO donor, were reduced in diabetic rats. Following the blockade of large-conductance Ca These findings suggest that the impaired BK N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA), a glutamate analog, can activate N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAR) to induce vascular endothelial cell injury but the mechanisms are not fully understood. The present study intended to evaluate the role of caveolin-1 (Cav-1) in NMDA-induced dysfunction of human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBEC-5i), and verify that endothelial NMDAR activation mediates the disruption of tight junction barrier integrity via extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 pathway. The expression of NMDAR NR1 were confirmed firstly in HBEC-5i and compared with that in mouse brain by Western blot. To study the role of Cav-1 in NMDA mediated reduction of tight junction protein zonula occludens- (ZO) 1 expression, HBEC-5i were transduced with Cav-1 shRNA or Control shRNA, and the Cav-1 knockdown rate tested with qRT-PCR and Western blot is 99.98% or 87.5%, respectively. NMDA exposure decreased mRNA and protein levels of tight junction protein ZO-1 and suppressed transendothelial electrical resistance (TEER) values in HBEC-5i but blocked by NMDAR antagonist MK801. In addition, NMDA induced Cav-1 and ERK1/2 sequential phosphorylation，but these effects were attenuated by silencing the Cav-1 gene with shRNA and ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126, respectively. These results show that the functional presence of NMDAR NR1 in HBEC-5i. Endothelial NMDAR NR1 activation regulate the maintenance of HBEC-5i-constructed tight junction barrier integrity via the caveolin-1-associated ERK1/2 signaling pathway. Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder of middle-aged and elderly people, clinically characterized by resting tremor, myotonia, reduced movement, and impaired postural balance. Clinically, patients with PD are often administered levodopa (L-DOPA) to improve their symptoms. However, after years of L-DOPA treatment, most patients experience complications of varying severity, including the ""on-off phenomenon"", decreased efficacy, and levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). The development of LID can seriously affect the quality of life of patients, but its pathogenesis is unclear and effective treatments are lacking. Glutamic acid (Glu)-mediated changes in synaptic plasticity play a major role in LID. The N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor (NMDAR), an ionotropic glutamate receptor, is closely associated with synaptic plasticity, and neuroinflammation can modulate NMDAR activation or expression; in addition, neuroinflammation may be involved in the development of LID. However, it is not clear whether NMDA receptors are co-regulated with neuroinflammation during LID formation. Here we review how neuroinflammation mediates the development of LID through the regulation of NMDA receptors, and assess whether common anti-inflammatory drugs and NMDA receptor antagonists may be able to mitigate the development of LID through the regulation of central neuroinflammation, thereby providing a new theoretical basis for finding new therapeutic targets for LID."

All animals need pantothenic acid in order to synthesize coenzyme A (CoA), which is essential for cellular energy production and for the synthesis and degradation of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Pantothenic acid is the combination of pantoic acid and β-alanine. Its name comes from the Greek πάντοθεν pantothen, meaning ""from everywhere"", because pantothenic acid, at least in small amounts, is in almost all foods. Deficiency of pantothenic acid is very rare in humans. In dietary supplements and animal feed, the form commonly used is calcium pantothenate, because chemically it is more stable, and hence makes for longer product shelf-life, than sodium pantothenate and free pantothenic acid. == Definition == Pantothenic acid is a water-soluble vitamin, one of the B vitamins. It is synthesized from the amino acid β-alanine and pantoic acid (see biosynthesis and structure of coenzyme A figures). Unlike vitamin E or vitamin K, which occurs in several chemically related forms known as vitamers, pantothenic acid is only one chemical compound. It is a starting compound in the synthesis of coenzyme A (CoA), a cofactor for many enzyme processes. == Use in biosynthesis of coenzyme A == Pantothenic acid is a precursor to CoA via a five-step process. The biosynthesis requires pantothenic acid, cysteine, and four equivalents of ATP (see figure). Pantothenic acid is phosphorylated to 4′-phosphopantothenate by the enzyme pantothenate kinase. This is the committed step in CoA biosynthesis and requires ATP. A cysteine is added to 4′-phosphopantothenate by the enzyme phosphopantothenoylcysteine synthetase to form 4'-phospho-N-pantothenoylcysteine (PPC). This step is coupled with ATP hydrolysis. PPC is decarboxylated to 4′-phosphopantetheine by phosphopantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase 4′-Phosphopantetheine is adenylated (or more properly, AMPylated) to form dephospho-CoA by the enzyme phosphopantetheine adenylyl transferase Finally, dephospho-CoA is phosphorylated to coenzyme A by the enzyme dephosphocoenzyme A kinase. This final step also requires ATP. This pathway is suppressed by end-product inhibition, meaning that CoA is a competitive inhibitor of pantothenate kinase, the enzyme responsible for the first step. Coenzyme A is necessary in the reaction mechanism of the citric acid cycle. This process is the body's primary catabolic pathway and is essential in breaking down the building blocks of the cell such as carbohydrates, amino acids and lipids, for fuel. CoA is important in energy metabolism for pyruvate to enter the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) as acetyl-CoA, and for α-ketoglutarate to be transformed to succinyl-CoA in the cycle. CoA is also required for acylation and acetylation, which, for example, are involved in signal transduction, and various enzyme functions. In addition to functioning as CoA, this compound can act as an acyl group carrier to form acetyl-CoA and other related compounds; this is a way to transport carbon atoms within the cell. CoA is also required in the formation of acyl carrier protein (ACP), which is required for fatty acid synthesis. Its synthesis also connects with other vitamins such as thiamin and folic acid. == Dietary recommendations == The US Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for B vitamins in 1998. At that time, there was not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs for pantothenic acid. In instances such as this, the Board sets Adequate Intakes (AIs), with the understanding that at some later date, AIs may be replaced by more exact information. The current AI for teens and adults ages 14 and up is 5 mg/day. This was based in part on the observation that for a typical diet, urinary excretion was approximately 2.6 mg/day, and that bioavailability of food-bound pantothenic acid was roughly 50%. AI for pregnancy is 6 mg/day. AI for lactation is 7 mg/day. For infants up to 12 months, the AI is 1.8 mg/day. For children ages 1–13 years, the AI increases with age from 2 to 4 mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). While for many nutrients, the US Department of Agriculture uses food composition data combined with food consumption survey results to estimate average consumption, the surveys and reports do not include pantothenic acid in the analyses. Less formal estimates of adult daily intakes report about 4 to 7 mg/day. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL are defined the same as in the US. For women and men over age 11, the Adequate Intake (AI) is set at 5 mg/day. AI for pregnancy is 5 mg/day, for lactation 7 mg/day. For children ages 1–10 years, the AI is 4 mg/day. These AIs are similar to the US AIs. === Safety === As for safety, the IOM sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of pantothenic acid, there is no UL, as there is no human data for adverse effects from high doses. The EFSA also reviewed the safety question and reached the same conclusion as in the United States – that there was not sufficient evidence to set a UL for pantothenic acid. === Labeling requirements === For US food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For pantothenic acid labeling purposes, 100% of the Daily Value was 10 mg, but as of May 2016 it was revised to 5 mg to bring it into agreement with the AI. Compliance with the updated labeling regulations was required by January 2020 for manufacturers with US$10 million or more in annual food sales, and by January 2021 for manufacturers with lower volume food sales. A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at Reference Daily Intake. == Sources == === Dietary === Food sources of pantothenic acid include animal-sourced foods, including dairy foods and eggs. Potatoes, tomato products, oat-cereals, sunflower seeds, avocado are good plant sources. Mushrooms are good sources, too. Whole grains are another source of the vitamin, but milling to make white rice or white flour removes much of the pantothenic acid, as it is found in the outer layers of whole grains. In animal feeds, the most important sources are alfalfa, cereal, fish meal, peanut meal, molasses, rice bran, wheat bran, and yeasts. === Supplements === Dietary supplements of pantothenic acid commonly use pantothenol (or panthenol), a shelf-stable analog, which is converted to pantothenic acid once consumed. Calcium pantothenate – a salt – may be used in manufacturing because it is more resistant than pantothenic acid to factors that deteriorate stability, such as acid, alkali or heat. The amount of pantothenic acid in dietary supplement products may contain up to 1,000 mg (200 times the Adequate Intake level for adults), without evidence that such large amounts provide any benefit. According to WebMD, pantothenic acid supplements have a long list of claimed uses, but there is insufficient scientific evidence to support any of them. As a dietary supplement, pantothenic acid is not the same as pantethine, which is composed of two pantothenic acid molecules linked by a disulfide bridge. Sold as a high-dose supplement (600 mg), pantethine may be effective for lowering blood levels of LDL cholesterol – a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases – but its long-term effects are unknown, so use should be supervised by a physician. Dietary supplementation with pantothenic acid does not have the cholesterol-lowering effect as pantethine. === Fortification === According to the Global Fortification Data Exchange, pantothenic acid deficiency is so rare that no countries require that foods be fortified. == Absorption, metabolism and excretion == When found in foods, most pantothenic acid is in the form of CoA or bound to acyl carrier protein (ACP). For the intestinal cells to absorb this vitamin, it must be converted into free pantothenic acid. Within the lumen of the intestine, CoA and ACP are hydrolyzed into 4'-phosphopantetheine. The 4'-phosphopantetheine is then dephosphorylated into pantetheine. Pantetheinase, an intestinal enzyme, then hydrolyzes pantetheine into free pantothenic acid. Free pantothenic acid is absorbed into intestinal cells via a saturable, sodium-dependent active transport system. At high levels of intake, when this mechanism is saturated, some pantothenic acid may also be additionally absorbed via passive diffusion. As a whole, when intake increases 10-fold, absorption rate decreases to 10%. Pantothenic acid is excreted in urine. This occurs after its release from CoA. Urinary amounts are on the order of 2.6 mg/day, but decreased to negligible amounts when subjects in multi-week experimental situations were fed diets devoid of the vitamin. == Deficiency == Pantothenic acid deficiency in humans is very rare and has not been thoroughly studied. In the few cases where deficiency has been seen (prisoners of war during World War II, victims of starvation, or limited volunteer trials), nearly all symptoms were reversed with orally administered pantothenic acid. Symptoms of deficiency are similar to other vitamin B deficiencies. There is impaired energy production, due to low CoA levels, which could cause symptoms of irritability, fatigue, and apathy. Acetylcholine synthesis is also impaired; therefore, neurological symptoms can also appear in deficiency; they include sensation of numbness in hands and feet, paresthesia and muscle cramps. Additional symptoms could include restlessness, malaise, sleep disturbances, nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps. In animals, symptoms include disorders of the nervous, gastrointestinal, and immune systems, reduced growth rate, decreased food intake, skin lesions and changes in hair coat, and alterations in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism. In rodents, there can be loss of hair color, which led to marketing of pantothenic acid as a dietary supplement which could prevent or treat graying of hair in humans (despite the lack of any human trial evidence). Pantothenic acid status can be assessed by measuring either whole blood concentration or 24-hour urinary excretion. In humans, whole blood values less than 1 μmol/L are considered low, as is urinary excretion of less than 4.56 mmol/day. == Animal nutrition == Calcium pantothenate and dexpanthenol (D-panthenol) are European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) approved additives to animal feed. Supplementation is on the order of 8–20 mg/kg for pigs, 10–15 mg/kg for poultry, 30–50 mg/kg for fish and 8–14 mg/kg feed for pets. These are recommended concentrations, designed to be higher than what are thought to be requirements. There is some evidence that feed supplementation increases pantothenic acid concentration in tissues, i.e., meat, consumed by humans, and also for eggs, but this raises no concerns for consumer safety. No dietary requirement for pantothenic acid has been established in ruminant species. Synthesis of pantothenic acid by ruminal microorganisms appears to be 20 to 30 times more than dietary amounts. Net microbial synthesis of pantothenic acid in the rumen of steer calves has been estimated to be 2.2 mg/kg of digestible organic matter consumed per day. Supplementation of pantothenic acid at 5 to 10 times theoretical requirements did not improve growth performance of feedlot cattle. == Synthesis == === Biosynthesis === Bacteria synthesize pantothenic acid from the amino acids aspartate and a precursor to the amino acid valine. Aspartate is converted to β-alanine. The amino group of valine is replaced by a keto-moiety to yield α-ketoisovalerate, which, in turn, forms α-ketopantoate following transfer of a methyl group, then D-pantoate (also known as pantoic acid) following reduction. β-alanine and pantoic acid are then condensed to form pantothenic acid (see figure). === Industrial synthesis === The industrial synthesis of pantothenic acid starts with the aldol condensation of isobutyraldehyde and formaldehyde. The resulting hydroxypivaldehyde is converted to its cyanohydrin derivative. which is cyclised to give racemic pantolactone. This sequence of reactions was first published in 1904. Synthesis of the vitamin is completed by resolution of the lactone using quinine, for example, followed by treatment with the calcium or sodium salt of β-alanine. == History == The term vitamin is derived from the word vitamine, which was coined in 1912 by Polish biochemist Casimir Funk, who isolated a complex of water-soluble micronutrients essential to life, all of which he presumed to be amines. When this presumption was later determined not to be true, the ""e"" was dropped from the name, hence ""vitamin"". Vitamin nomenclature was alphabetical, with Elmer McCollum calling these fat-soluble A and water-soluble B. Over time, eight chemically distinct, water-soluble B vitamins were isolated and numbered, with pantothenic acid as vitamin B5. The essential nature of pantothenic acid was discovered by Roger J. Williams in 1933 by showing it was required for the growth of yeast. Three years later Elvehjem and Jukes demonstrated that it was a growth and anti-dermatitis factor in chickens. Williams dubbed the compound ""pantothenic acid"", deriving the name from the Greek word pantothen, which translates as ""from everywhere"". His reason was that he found it to be present in almost every food he tested. Williams went on to determine the chemical structure in 1940. In 1953, Fritz Lipmann shared the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine ""for his discovery of co-enzyme A and its importance for intermediary metabolism"", work he had published in 1946. == References =="	Pantothenic acid	WIKIPEDIA	('FOOD', [('FO', -0.004153310786932707), ('OD', 0.0)])

Recently, we found that leukotoxin-diol, the hydrated product of leukotoxin, is more toxic than the parent leukotoxin in vitro (Moghaddam and colleagues, Nature Med. 1997;3:562-566). To test if this difference in the toxicity of leukotoxin and leukotoxin-diol exists in vivo, Swiss Webster mice were administered leukotoxin or leukotoxin-diol. All mice treated with leukotoxin-diol died of ARDS-like respiratory distress, whereas the animals exposed to leukotoxin at the same dose survived. Histopathologic evaluation of the lungs revealed massive alveolar edema and hemorrhage with interstitial edema around blood vessels in the lungs of mice treated with leukotoxin-diol, whereas the lungs of mice treated with identical doses of leukotoxin had perivascular edema only and little change in alveolar spaces. Immunohistochemistry showed that the soluble epoxide hydrolase responsible for the hydrolysis of leukotoxin to its diol is concentrated in the vascular smooth muscle of small and medium-sized pulmonary vessels. In addition, 4-phenylchalcone oxide, an inhibitor of soluble epoxide hydrolase, was found to decrease the mortality induced by leukotoxin but had no effect on mortality induced by leukotoxin-diol. These studies provide strong in vivo evidence that leukotoxin may act as a protoxicant and that the corresponding diol is a putative toxic mediator involved in the development of ARDS. LC/MS quantification of leukotoxin (LTX) and leukotoxin diol (LTXdiol) in plasma has been previously reported, however large sample volumes are required for achieving stated assay Lower Limit of Quantification (LLOQ). Reported here is a fit-for-purpose LC/MS method that reduces plasma volume from 700 to 25 µL and omits pre-concentration steps. These improvements make for a method with increased utility in mouse studies offering limited sample volumes. Additionally, omitting pre-concentration steps streamlines sample processing, which can now be completed in under 10 min. This method can be used to quickly answer if the ratio of LTX to LTXdiol changes with the dose of the therapeutic drug so this could be used as a potential biomarker for correlating PK/PD effects. No extensive assay characterization was performed before application to an exploratory in-life study. Basal levels of LTX and LTXdiol in plasma were quantified by LC-MRM across 10 individual mice, and the average signal-to-noise was 36 for LTX and 3039 for LTXdiol, with CVs of 29.4% and 15.2%, respectively. Addition of LTX and LTXdiol reference standard at 5, 25, and 75 ng/mL into pooled mouse plasma was quantifiable within 30% relative error using a surrogate matrix calibration curve ranging from 0.8 to 200 ng/mL. The average ratio of LTX to LTXdiol across the 10 mice was 0.32, consistent with previous reports. Finally, the method was applied to a mouse PK/PD study to monitor LTX/LTXdiol kinetics after a single oral dose of a soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor. The mean plasma ratio of LTX to LTXdiol increased up to 10-fold by 3 h post-dose followed by a decrease to near pre-dose levels by 24 h, consistent with transient inhibition of sEH-mediated conversion of LTX to LTXdiol. The method improvements described here will make subsequent quantification of LTX and LTXdiol in mouse studies significantly easier. Substrates and products of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) such as 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (14,15-EET), 14,15-dihydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (14,15-DHET), leukotoxin, and leukotoxin diol are potential biomarkers for assessing sEH activity in clinical trial subjects. To quantify them, we have developed and validated a semi-automated and relatively high-throughput assay in a 96-well plate format using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. 14,15-EET, 14,15-DHET, leukotoxin and leukotoxin diol, as well as their deuterium labeled internal standards were extracted from human plasma by liquid-liquid extraction using ethyl acetate. The four analytes were separated from other endogenous lipid isomers using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The method was validated over a concentration range of 0.05-50 ng/mL. The validation results show that the method is precise, accurate and well-suited for analysis of clinical samples. The turn-around rate of the assay is approximately 200 samples per day.	Leukotoxin diol	PUBMED	('INFO', [('INFO', -0.00681269308552146)])

In biosynthesizing tricin, there is first stepwise addition of malonyl-CoA via the polyketide pathway and p-coumaroyl-CoA via the phenylpropanoid pathway. These additions are mediated by the sequential action of chalcone synthase and chalcone isomerase to yield naringenin chalcone and the flavanone, naringenin, respectively. CYP93G1 of the CYP450 superfamily in rice then desaturates naringenin into apigenin. After this step, it is proposed that flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase (F3',5'H) changes apigenin into tricetin.

40748.0	('Harman', 'Harmane', 'Aribine', 'Loturine', 'Locuturine')	mouse	 The aromatic beta-carbolines norharman and harman have been implicated in a number of human diseases including Parkinson's disease, tremor, addiction and cancer. It has been shown that these compounds are normal body constituents formed endogenously but external sources have been identified. Here, we summarise literature data on levels of norharman and harman in fried meat and fish, meat extracts, alcoholic drinks, and coffee brews. Other sources include edible and medicinal plants but tobacco smoke has been identified as a major source. Exposure levels from these different dietary sources are estimated to a maximum of 4 microg norharman per kg body weight (bw) per day and 1 microg harman per kg bw per day. Exposure via tobacco smoke depends on smoking habits and type of cigarettes but can be estimated to 1.1 microg/kg bw for norharman and 0.6 microg/kg bw for harman per package of cigarettes smoked. Studies on toxicokinetics indicate that inhalative exposure leads to a rapid increase in plasma levels and high bioavailability of norharman and harman. Oral bioavailability is lower but there are indications that sublingual absorption may increase dietary uptake of beta-carbolines. Endogenous formation can be estimated to be 50-100 ng/kg bw per day for norharman and about 20 ng/kg bw per day for harman but these rates may increase with high intake of precursors. Biomarker studies on plasma levels of beta-carbolines reported on elevated levels of norharman, harman or both in diseased patients, alcoholics and following tobacco smoking or consumption of beta-carboline-containing food.

Subclinical protein malnutrition is an independent predictor of aortic stiffness (AS). We aimed to study the relationship between serum 3MH level and AS among patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (MHD). Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity was applied to measure AS of 110 MHD patients. Serum 3MH levels were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. AS was defined as cfPWV >10 m/s. Forty-five (40.9%) patients were categorized as having AS. Multivariable logistic (odds ratio: 0.792, p < 0.001) and linear (β = -0.322, p < 0.001) regression analysis revealed that serum 3MH is an independent factor associated with AS among MHD patients. The diagnostic power of 3MH for AS in patients undergoing MHD was 0.691 (95% CI: 0.595-0.775, p = 0.0002). Low serum 3MH levels could be a potential biomarker related to AS among MHD patients.

121800.0	('Octadecanoic acid, 3-hydroxy-', 'Rac-3-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid')	mouse	 Acne is an inflammatory disorder with a high global burden. It is common in adolescents and primarily affects sebaceous gland-rich areas. The clinical benefit of the topical acne treatments azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, sulphur, zinc, and alpha-hydroxy acid is unclear. To assess the effects of topical treatments (azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, zinc, alpha-hydroxy acid, and sulphur) for acne. We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers. Clinical randomised controlled trials of the six topical treatments compared with other topical treatments, placebo, or no treatment in people with acne. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Key outcomes included participants' global self-assessment of acne improvement (PGA), withdrawal for any reason, minor adverse events (assessed as total number of participants who experienced at least one minor adverse event), and quality of life. We included 49 trials (3880 reported participants) set in clinics, hospitals, research centres, and university settings in Europe, Asia, and the USA. The vast majority of participants had mild to moderate acne, were aged between 12 to 30 years (range: 10 to 45 years), and were female. Treatment lasted over eight weeks in 59% of the studies. Study duration ranged from three months to three years. We assessed 26 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain, but most domains were at low or unclear risk of bias. We grouped outcome assessment into short-term (less than or equal to 4 weeks), medium-term (from 5 to 8 weeks), and long-term treatment (more than 8 weeks). The following results were measured at the end of treatment, which was mainly long-term for the PGA outcome and mixed length (medium-term mainly) for minor adverse events. Azelaic acid In terms of treatment response (PGA), azelaic acid is probably less effective than benzoyl peroxide (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.95; 1 study, 351 participants), but there is probably little or no difference when comparing azelaic acid to tretinoin (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.14; 1 study, 289 participants) (both moderate-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in PGA when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.38; 1 study, 229 participants; low-quality evidence), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates there may be no differences in rates of withdrawal for any reason when comparing azelaic acid with benzoyl peroxide (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.29; 1 study, 351 participants), clindamycin (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.56; 2 studies, 329 participants), or tretinoin (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.47; 2 studies, 309 participants), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). In terms of total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is a difference between azelaic acid compared to adapalene (1 study; 55 participants) or benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 30 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). There may be no difference when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.67 to 3.35; 1 study, 100 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the comparison of azelaic acid versus tretinoin, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling. Salicylic acid For PGA, there may be little or no difference between salicylic acid and tretinoin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09; 1 study, 46 participants; low-quality evidence); we are not certain whether there is a difference between salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (1 study, 86 participants; very low-quality evidence); and PGA was not measured in the comparison of salicylic acid versus benzoyl peroxide. There may be no difference between groups in withdrawals when comparing salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.50; 1 study, 86 participants); when salicylic acid was compared to tretinoin, neither group had withdrawals (both based on low-quality evidence (2 studies, 74 participants)). We are uncertain whether there is a difference in withdrawals between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants; very low-quality evidence). For total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is any difference between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants) or tretinoin (2 studies, 74 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). This outcome was not reported for salicylic acid versus pyruvic acid, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling and redness. Nicotinamide Four studies evaluated nicotinamide against clindamycin or erythromycin, but none measured PGA. Low-quality evidence showed there may be no difference in withdrawals between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.60; 3 studies, 216 participants) or erythromycin (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.22; 1 study, 158 participants), or in total minor adverse events between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.99; 3 studies, 216 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the nicotinamide versus erythromycin comparison. Alpha-hydroxy (fruit) acid There may be no difference in PGA when comparing glycolic acid peel to salicylic-mandelic acid peel (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.26; 1 study, 40 participants; low-quality evidence), and we are uncertain if there is a difference in total minor adverse events due to very low-quality evidence (1 study, 44 participants). Neither group had withdrawals (2 studies, 84 participants; low-quality evidence). Compared to benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid probably leads to a worse treatment response, measured using PGA. When compared to tretinoin, azelaic acid probably makes little or no difference to treatment response. For other comparisons and outcomes the quality of evidence was low or very low. Risk of bias and imprecision limit our confidence in the evidence. We encourage the comparison of more methodologically robust head-to-head trials against commonly used active drugs. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, antioxidant, and essential co-factor for collagen biosynthesis, carnitine and catecholamine metabolism, and dietary iron absorption. Humans are unable to synthesize vitamin C, so it is strictly obtained through the dietary intake of fruits and vegetables. Citrus fruits, berries, tomatoes, potatoes, and green leafy vegetables are excellent sources of vitamin C. Although most vitamin C is completely absorbed in the small intestine, the percentage of absorbed vitamin C decreases as intraluminal concentrations increase. Proline residues on procollagen require vitamin C for hydroxylation, making it necessary for the triple-helix formation of mature collagen. The lack of a stable triple-helical structure compromises the integrity of the skin, mucous membranes, blood vessels, and bone. Consequently, a deficiency in vitamin C results in scurvy, which presents with hemorrhage, hyperkeratosis, and hematological abnormalities. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of vitamin C so providers can direct patient therapy in treatment or supplementation where it is indicated as part of the interprofessional team. Vitamin B5, also known as pantothenic acid, is a water-soluble nutrient necessary for various metabolic functions within the body. This essential vitamin participates in energy generation, synthesizing hormones, and maintaining optimal conditions for skin, hair, and nails. Supplemental vitamin B5 is employed to address and mitigate nutrient deficiencies. This activity discusses the mechanisms of action, adverse event profile, off-label applications, appropriate dosing strategies, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring procedures, and relevant interactions of vitamin B5. Participants gain insights and knowledge essential for managing cases involving nutritional deficiencies and related conditions.

90873.0	('Docosahexaenoic acid', 'Doconexent', 'Cervonic acid', 'Cis-4,7,10,13,16,19-docosahexaenoic acid', 'Docosahexaenoate')	mouse	"Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is an omega−3 fatty acid that is an important component of the human brain, cerebral cortex, skin, and retina. It is given the fatty acid notation 22:6(n−3). It can be synthesized from alpha-linolenic acid or obtained directly from maternal milk (breast milk), fatty fish, fish oil, or algae oil. The consumption of DHA (e.g., from fatty fish such as salmon, herring, mackerel and sardines) contributes to numerous physiological benefits, including cognition. As a component of neuronal membranes, the function of DHA is to support neuronal conduction and to allow the optimal functioning of neuronal membrane proteins (such as receptors and enzymes). Structurally, DHA is a carboxylic acid (-oic acid) with a 22-carbon chain (docosa- derives from the Ancient Greek for 22) and six (hexa-) cis double bonds (-en-); with the first double bond located at the third carbon from the omega end. Its trivial name is cervonic acid (from the Latin word cerebrum for ""brain""), its systematic name is all-cis-docosa-4,7,10,13,16,19-hexa-enoic acid. In organisms that do not eat algae containing DHA nor animal products containing DHA, DHA is instead produced internally from α-linolenic acid, a shorter omega−3 fatty acid manufactured by plants (and also occurring in animal products as obtained from plants). Limited amounts of eicosapentaenoic and docosapentaenoic acids are possible products of α-linolenic acid metabolism in young women and men. DHA in breast milk is important for the developing infant. Rates of DHA production in women are 15% higher than in men. DHA is a major fatty acid in brain phospholipids and the retina. Preliminary research has investigated its potential benefit in Alzheimer's disease, and cardiovascular disease, and other disorders. == Central nervous system constituent == DHA is the most abundant omega−3 fatty acid in the brain and retina. DHA comprises 40% of the polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in the brain and 60% of the PUFAs in the retina. Fifty percent of a neuronal plasma membrane is composed of DHA. DHA modulates the carrier-mediated transport of choline, glycine, and taurine, the function of delayed rectifier potassium channels, and the response of rhodopsin contained in the synaptic vesicles. Phosphatidylserine (PS) – which contains high DHA content – has roles in neuronal signaling and neurotransmitter synthesis, and DHA deficiency is associated with cognitive decline. DHA levels are reduced in the brain tissue of severely depressed people. == Biosynthesis == === Aerobic eukaryote pathway === Aerobic eukaryotes, specifically microalgae, mosses, fungi, and some animals, perform biosynthesis of DHA as a series of desaturation and elongation reactions, catalyzed by the sequential action of desaturase and elongase enzymes. This pathway, originally identified in Thraustochytrium, applies to these groups: a desaturation at the sixth carbon of alpha-linolenic acid by a delta 6 desaturase to produce stearidonic acid (SDA, 18:4 ω-3), elongation of the stearidonic acid by a delta 6 elongase to produce eicosatetraenoic acid (ETA, 20:4 ω-3), desaturation at the fifth carbon of eicosatetraenoic acid by a delta 5 desaturase to produce eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 ω-3), elongation of eicosapentaenoic acid by a delta 5 elongase to produce docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, 22:5 ω-3), and desaturation at the fourth carbon of docosapentaenoic acid by a delta 4 desaturase to produce DHA. === Mammals === In humans, DHA is either obtained from the diet or may be converted in small amounts from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5, ω-3). With the identification of FADS2 as a human Δ4-desaturase in 2015, it is now known that humans follow the same synthesis pathway as aerobic eukaryotes, involving Δ5-elongation to DPA and Δ4-desaturation to DHA. A ""Sprecher's shunt"" hypothesis, proposed in 1991, postulates that EPA is twice elongated to 24:5 ω-3, then desaturated to 24:6 ω-3 (via delta 6 desaturase) in the mitochondria, then shortened to DHA (22:6 ω-3) via beta oxidation in the peroxisome. The hypothesis was accepted in the absence of an identified Δ4-desaturase in mammals prior to 2015. The shunt model does not match clinical data, specifically that patients with beta oxidation defects do not display issues in DHA synthesis. With the identification of a Δ4-desaturase, it is considered outdated. === Anaerobic pathway === Marine bacteria and the microalgae Schizochytrium use an anerobic polyketide synthase pathway to synthesize DHA. == Metabolism == DHA can be metabolized into DHA-derived specialized pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), DHA epoxides, electrophilic oxo-derivatives (EFOX) of DHA, neuroprostanes, ethanolamines, acylglycerols, docosahexaenoyl amides of amino acids or neurotransmitters, and branched DHA esters of hydroxy fatty acids, among others. The enzyme CYP2C9 metabolizes DHA to epoxydocosapentaenoic acids (EDPs; primarily 19,20-epoxy-eicosapentaenoic acid isomers [i.e. 10,11-EDPs]). == Potential health effects == === Cardiovascular === Though mixed and plagued by methodological inconsistencies, there is now convincing evidence from ecological, RCTs, meta-analyses and animal trials that shows a benefit for omega−3 dietary intake for cardiovascular health. Of the n−3 FAs, DHA has been argued to be the most beneficial due to its preferential uptake in the myocardium, its strongly anti-inflammatory activity and its metabolism toward neuroprotectins and resolvins, the latter of which directly contribute to cardiac function. DHA is associated with its role in cardiovascular protection and lowering the risk of coronary artery disease. DHA supplementation has been shown to improve high-density lipoprotein (‘good cholesterol’), and lower total cholesterol as well as blood pressure levels. === Pregnancy and lactation === Foods high in omega−3 fatty acids may be recommended to women who want to become pregnant or when nursing. A working group from the International Society for the Study of Fatty Acids and Lipids recommended 300 mg/day of DHA for pregnant and lactating women, whereas the average consumption was between 45 mg and 115 mg per day of the women in the study, similar to a Canadian study. === Brain and visual functions === A major structural component of the mammalian central nervous system, DHA is the most abundant omega−3 fatty acid in the brain and retina. Brain and retinal function rely on dietary intake of DHA to support a broad range of cell membrane and cell signaling properties, particularly in grey matter and retinal photoreceptor cell outer segments, which are rich in membranes. A systematic review found that DHA had no significant benefits in improving visual field in individuals with retinitis pigmentosa. Animal research shows effect of oral intake of deuterium-reinforced DHA (D-DHA) for prevention of macular degeneration. === Asthma === Omega−3 PUFAs such as DHA and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are effective in the prevention and treatment of asthma and allergic diseases. == Nutrition == Ordinary types of cooked salmon contain 500–1500 mg DHA and 300–1000 mg EPA per 100 grams. Additional rich seafood sources of DHA include caviar (3400 mg per 100 grams), anchovies (1292 mg per 100 grams), mackerel (1195 mg per 100 grams), and cooked herring (1105 mg per 100 grams). Brains from mammals taken as food are also a good direct source. Beef brain, for example, contains approximately 855 mg of DHA per 100 grams in a serving. While DHA may be the primary fatty acid found in certain specialized tissues, these tissues, aside from the brain, are typically small in size, such as the seminiferous tubules and the retina. As a result, animal-based foods, excluding the brain, generally offer minimal amounts of preformed DHA. === Discovery of algae-based DHA === In the early 1980s, NASA sponsored scientific research on a plant-based food source that could generate oxygen and nutrition on long-duration space flights. Certain species of marine algae produced rich nutrients, leading to the development of an algae-based, vegetable-like oil that contains two polyunsaturated fatty acids, DHA and arachidonic acid. === Use as a food additive === DHA is widely used as a food supplement. It was first used primarily in infant formulas. In 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration published qualified health claims for DHA. Some manufactured DHA is a vegetarian product extracted from algae, and it competes on the market with fish oil that contains DHA and other omega−3s such as EPA. Both fish oil and DHA are odorless and tasteless after processing as a food additive. === Studies of vegetarians and vegans === Vegetarian diets typically contain limited amounts of DHA, and vegan diets typically contain no DHA. In preliminary research, algae-based supplements increased DHA levels. While there is little evidence of adverse health or cognitive effects due to DHA deficiency in adult vegetarians or vegans, breast milk levels remain a concern for supplying adequate DHA to the infant. === DHA and EPA in fish oils === Fish oil is widely sold in capsules containing a mixture of omega−3 fatty acids, including EPA and DHA. Oxidized fish oil in supplement capsules may contain lower levels of EPA and DHA. Light, oxygen exposure, and heat can all contribute to oxidation of fish oil supplements. Buying a quality product that is kept cold in storage and then keeping it in a refrigerator can help minimize oxidation. === Recommended daily DHA intake for children === As optimal DHA level is important for brain development and maturation, there are established daily recommendations for DHA intake in children. The table below shows the daily DHA / DHA + EPA intake recommended for children of different ages: Experts recommend DHA intake of 10–12 mg/day for children 12–24 months, 100–150 mg/day of DHA+EPA for children 2–4 years old and 150–200 mg/day of DHA+EPA for children 4–6 years old. == See also == DHA-clozapine List of omega−3 fatty acids Polyunsaturated fatty acids == References =="	Docosahexaenoic acid	WIKIPEDIA	('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL', [('END', -0.07124201208353043), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -1.8624639324116288e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.00043162284418940544), (',', -0.01815790683031082), (' PERSONAL', -0.14372751116752625), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.4745974838733673), (' MED', -0.07004047185182571), ('ICAL', 0.0)])

It was proposed this is a Ca(2+)-dependent effect and that protein kinase C is involved. Here we report that arachidonic acid and oleoylacetylglycerol synergistically potentiate the glutamate release induced by the Ca2+ ionophore ionomycin. The Ca2+ dependence of this effect was established, as removal of Ca2+ eliminated evoked release and the lipid-dependent potentiation. Also, Ca2+ channel blockers attenuated ionomycin- and KCl-evoked exocytosis, as well as the facilitating effects of the lipid mediators. Although facilitation required Ca2+, it may not involve an enhancement of evoked Ca2+ accumulation, because ionomycin-dependent glutamate release was potentiated under conditions that did not increase ionomycin-induced Ca2+ accumulation. Also, the facilitation may not depend on inhibition of K+ efflux, because enhanced release was observed in the presence of increasing concentrations of 4-aminopyridine and diazoxide did not reduce the lipid-dependent potentiation of exocytosis. In contrast, disruption of cytoskeleton organization with cytochalasin D occluded the lipid-dependent facilitations of both KCl- and ionomycin-evoked glutamate release. In addition, arachidonic acid plus glutamatergic or cholinergic agonists enhanced glutamate release, whereas a role for protein kinase C in the potentiation of exocytosis was substantiated using kinase inhibitors. It appears that the lipid-dependent facilitation of glutamate release from mossy fiber nerve endings requires Ca2+ and involves multiple presynaptic effects, some of which depend on protein kinase C. The diacylglycerol analogue 1,2-oleoylacetylglycerol (OAG) and the phorbol ester 12-deoxyphorbol 13-isobutyrate (DPB) were tested for their effects on the voltage-dependent calcium (Ca) current in embryonic chicken dorsal root ganglion neurons in vitro. OAG (0.6-60 microM) and DPB (0.01-50 microM) produced reversible decreases in Ca current. Neither drug affected resting membrane conductance, the voltage-dependent potassium current, or the Ca current-voltage relationship. The concentrations of OAG and DPB that reduced Ca current correlate well with those concentrations that have been shown, in other systems, to activate protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation. The time course for OAG action on Ca current is also consistent with an involvement of kinase C. Incubation of dorsal root ganglion cells in 60 microM OAG prevented further reductions in Ca current by either 50 microM DPB or 10 microM norepinephrine, a known modulator of the voltage-dependent Ca channel in these cells. This evidence suggests that protein kinase C may play a role in modulating Ca channel function. Prostanoids are synthesized by resident macrophages upon stimulation with diacylglycerols. Oleoylacetylglycerol and dioctanoylglycerol induced prostaglandin E and thromboxane synthesis in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. Both diacylglycerols inhibited the lysophosphatide acyltransferase, which is the key enzyme in the reacylation of arachidonic acid. By this mechanism the pool of free arachidonic acid available for prostanoid synthesis is increased. Both diacylglycerols were able to inhibit the membrane-bound lysophosphatide acyltransferase by a direct interaction independent of protein kinase C. Thus lysophosphatide acyltransferase could be shown to be a new target of these diacylglycerols, known as activators of protein kinase C.

Effective methods for polypeptide synthesis from unit peptides have not been reported. Here, we used a key elastin peptide, H-GlyValGlyValPro-OH (GVGVP), as the monomer peptide. It is difficult to obtain poly(Gly-Val-Gly-Val-Pro) (poly(GVGVP)) from the pentapeptide unit of elastin, GVGVP, via polycondensation. Poly(GVGVP) prepared from genetically recombinant Escherichia coli is a well-known temperature-sensitive polypeptide, and this temperature sensitivity is known as the lower critical solution temperature. When microwave irradiation was performed in the presence of various additives, the pentapeptide (GVGVP) polycondensation reaction proceeded smoothly, resulting in a product with a high molecular weight in a relatively good yield. The reaction conditions, like microwave irradiation, coupling agents, and solvents, were optimized to increase the reaction efficiency. The product exhibited a molecular weight greater than Mr 7000. Further, the product could be synthesized on a gram scale.

The study aimed to identify small molecules having potentiality in alleviating renal injury. Two natural compounds cyclo(Val-Pro) (1) and cyclo(Leu-Hydroxy-Pro) (2) were first evaluated under acute renal injury model of ischemic reperfusion at different doses of 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg body weight. Further, the compounds were subjected to antimycin A-induced ischemic in vitro study (NRK-52E cell lines). Both the compounds significantly decreased plasma IL-1β levels (P < 0.05). Also, the mRNA expression levels of inflammatory markers (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β) and renal injury markers (KIM-1, NGAL, α-GST and π-GST) in the renal tissues were significantly alleviated (P < 0.01) along with the improvement in histological damage and control over neutrophil infiltration as a result of ischemic reperfusion.

However, circadian rhythm effects determined by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to eliminate the confounding influence of the white-coat effect have not been fully studied. Twelve hypertensive patients not receiving antihypertensive medication (2 men, 10 women; mean age±standard deviation, 63.5±8.3 years) who had been visiting our clinic for more than 1 year participated in this study. Mean (±standard deviation) systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were 142.4±2.6 and 83.5±6.4 mm Hg, respectively, at the first office visit. After patients ingested a fermented milk product containing antihypertensive peptides (2.53 mg Val-Pro-Pro; 1.52 mg Ile-Pro-Pro) for more than 4 weeks, both office SBP and DBP were significantly reduced to a mean (±standard deviation) of 133.3±7.0 mm Hg and 76.5±8.4 mm Hg (P<.001 and P<.005 by paired t-test), respectively. The 24-hour SBP and DBP determined by ABPM were reduced from 127.3±2.4 and 78.7±2.3 mm Hg to 120.2±2.4 and 75.0±2.2 mm Hg (P<.001 and P<.05), respectively. Awake-time SBP (08:00-21:00), night-time SBP (0:00-05:00), and early-morning SBP (06:00-07:00) were reduced from 130.9±2.4 to 123.3±2.3 mm Hg, 118.7±2.9 to 113.2±3.4 mm Hg, and 132.8±4.3 to 122.4±3.9 mm Hg (by paired t-test: P<.001, P<.05, and P<.05), respectively. As seen with DBP measured by ABPM, 24-hour DBP and awake-time DBP were significantly reduced from 78.7±2.3 to 75.0±2.2 mm Hg and 82.1±2.5 to 77.3±2.2 mm Hg (P<.05 and P<.01), respectively. Office BP and 24-hour blood pressure did not significantly differ between the dipper and nondipper groups at baseline. However, after treatment, night-time and early-morning blood pressure were significantly reduced from baseline in the nondipper group (-8.5±2.5 and -15.6±3.7 mm Hg; P<.05 and P<.01, respectively) but not in the dipper group (-2.5±3.6 and -1.2±4.7 mm Hg; P not significant), and the reduction in early-morning blood pressure significantly differed between the groups (P<.05).

Mead. As with some other omega-9 polyunsaturated fatty acids, animals can make Mead acid de novo. Its elevated presence in the blood is an indication of essential fatty acid deficiency. Mead acid is found in large quantities in cartilage. == Chemistry == Mead acid, also referred to as eicosatrienoic acid, is chemically a carboxylic acid with a 20-carbon chain and three methylene-interrupted cis double bonds, as is typical for polyunsaturated fatty acids. The first double bond is located at the ninth carbon from the omega end. In physiological literature, it is given the name 20:3 (n-9). (See Fatty acid § Nomenclature for an explanation of the naming system.) In the presence of lipoxygenase, cytochrome p450, or cyclooxygenase, mead acid can form various hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) and hydroperoxy (HpETE) products. == Physiology == Two fatty acids, linoleic acid and alpha-linolenic acid, are considered essential fatty acids (EFAs) in humans and other mammals. Both are 18 carbon fatty acids unlike mead acid, which has 20 carbons. Linoleic is an ω-6 fatty acid whereas linolenic is ω-3 and mead is ω-9. One study examined patients with intestinal fat malabsorption and suspected EFA deficiency; they were found to have blood-levels of mead acid about 13-fold higher than reference subjects. Under severe conditions of essential fatty acid deprivation, mammals will elongate and desaturate oleic acid to make mead acid, (20:3, n−9). This has been documented to a lesser extent in vegetarians and semi-vegetarians following an unbalanced diet. Mead acid has been found to decrease osteoblastic activity. This may be important in treating conditions where inhibition of bone formation is desired. == Role in inflammation == Cyclooxygenases are enzymes known to play a large role in inflammatory processes through oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids, most notably, the formation of prostaglandin H2 from arachidonic acid (AA). AA has the same chain length as Mead acid but an additional ω-6 double bond. When physiological levels of arachidonic acid are low, other unsaturated fatty acids including mead and linoleic acid are oxidized by COX. Cyclooxygenase breaks the bisallylic C-H bond of AA to synthesize prostaglandin H2, but breaks a stronger allylic C-H bond when it encounters Mead acid instead. Mead acid is also converted to leukotrienes C3 and D3. Mead acid is metabolized by 5-lipoxygenase to 5-hydroxyeicosatrienoic acid (5-HETrE) and then by 5-hydroxyeicosanoid dehydrogenase to 5-oxoeicosatrienoic acid (5-oxo-ETrE). 5-Oxo-ETrE is as potent as its arachidonic acid-derived analog, 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE), in stimulating human blood eosinophils and neutrophils; it presumably does so by binding to the 5-oxo-ETE receptor (OXER1) and therefore may be, like 5-oxo-ETE, a mediator of human allergic and inflammatory reactions. == See also == Polyunsaturated fat – lists of ω-3 and ω-6 fatty acids; some others.

It is common in adolescents and primarily affects sebaceous gland-rich areas. The clinical benefit of the topical acne treatments azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, sulphur, zinc, and alpha-hydroxy acid is unclear. To assess the effects of topical treatments (azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, zinc, alpha-hydroxy acid, and sulphur) for acne. We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers. Clinical randomised controlled trials of the six topical treatments compared with other topical treatments, placebo, or no treatment in people with acne. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Key outcomes included participants' global self-assessment of acne improvement (PGA), withdrawal for any reason, minor adverse events (assessed as total number of participants who experienced at least one minor adverse event), and quality of life. We included 49 trials (3880 reported participants) set in clinics, hospitals, research centres, and university settings in Europe, Asia, and the USA. The vast majority of participants had mild to moderate acne, were aged between 12 to 30 years (range: 10 to 45 years), and were female. Treatment lasted over eight weeks in 59% of the studies. Study duration ranged from three months to three years. We assessed 26 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain, but most domains were at low or unclear risk of bias. We grouped outcome assessment into short-term (less than or equal to 4 weeks), medium-term (from 5 to 8 weeks), and long-term treatment (more than 8 weeks). The following results were measured at the end of treatment, which was mainly long-term for the PGA outcome and mixed length (medium-term mainly) for minor adverse events. Azelaic acid In terms of treatment response (PGA), azelaic acid is probably less effective than benzoyl peroxide (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.95; 1 study, 351 participants), but there is probably little or no difference when comparing azelaic acid to tretinoin (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.14; 1 study, 289 participants) (both moderate-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in PGA when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.38; 1 study, 229 participants; low-quality evidence), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates there may be no differences in rates of withdrawal for any reason when comparing azelaic acid with benzoyl peroxide (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.29; 1 study, 351 participants), clindamycin (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.56; 2 studies, 329 participants), or tretinoin (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.47; 2 studies, 309 participants), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). In terms of total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is a difference between azelaic acid compared to adapalene (1 study; 55 participants) or benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 30 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). There may be no difference when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.67 to 3.35; 1 study, 100 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the comparison of azelaic acid versus tretinoin, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling. Salicylic acid For PGA, there may be little or no difference between salicylic acid and tretinoin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09; 1 study, 46 participants; low-quality evidence); we are not certain whether there is a difference between salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (1 study, 86 participants; very low-quality evidence); and PGA was not measured in the comparison of salicylic acid versus benzoyl peroxide. There may be no difference between groups in withdrawals when comparing salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.50; 1 study, 86 participants); when salicylic acid was compared to tretinoin, neither group had withdrawals (both based on low-quality evidence (2 studies, 74 participants)). We are uncertain whether there is a difference in withdrawals between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants; very low-quality evidence). For total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is any difference between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants) or tretinoin (2 studies, 74 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). This outcome was not reported for salicylic acid versus pyruvic acid, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling and redness. Nicotinamide Four studies evaluated nicotinamide against clindamycin or erythromycin, but none measured PGA. Low-quality evidence showed there may be no difference in withdrawals between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.60; 3 studies, 216 participants) or erythromycin (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.22; 1 study, 158 participants), or in total minor adverse events between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.99; 3 studies, 216 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the nicotinamide versus erythromycin comparison. Alpha-hydroxy (fruit) acid There may be no difference in PGA when comparing glycolic acid peel to salicylic-mandelic acid peel (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.26; 1 study, 40 participants; low-quality evidence), and we are uncertain if there is a difference in total minor adverse events due to very low-quality evidence (1 study, 44 participants). Neither group had withdrawals (2 studies, 84 participants; low-quality evidence). Compared to benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid probably leads to a worse treatment response, measured using PGA. When compared to tretinoin, azelaic acid probably makes little or no difference to treatment response. For other comparisons and outcomes the quality of evidence was low or very low. Risk of bias and imprecision limit our confidence in the evidence. We encourage the comparison of more methodologically robust head-to-head trials against commonly used active drugs. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, antioxidant, and essential co-factor for collagen biosynthesis, carnitine and catecholamine metabolism, and dietary iron absorption. Humans are unable to synthesize vitamin C, so it is strictly obtained through the dietary intake of fruits and vegetables. Citrus fruits, berries, tomatoes, potatoes, and green leafy vegetables are excellent sources of vitamin C. Although most vitamin C is completely absorbed in the small intestine, the percentage of absorbed vitamin C decreases as intraluminal concentrations increase. Proline residues on procollagen require vitamin C for hydroxylation, making it necessary for the triple-helix formation of mature collagen. The lack of a stable triple-helical structure compromises the integrity of the skin, mucous membranes, blood vessels, and bone. Consequently, a deficiency in vitamin C results in scurvy, which presents with hemorrhage, hyperkeratosis, and hematological abnormalities. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of vitamin C so providers can direct patient therapy in treatment or supplementation where it is indicated as part of the interprofessional team. Vitamin B5, also known as pantothenic acid, is a water-soluble nutrient necessary for various metabolic functions within the body. This essential vitamin participates in energy generation, synthesizing hormones, and maintaining optimal conditions for skin, hair, and nails. Supplemental vitamin B5 is employed to address and mitigate nutrient deficiencies. This activity discusses the mechanisms of action, adverse event profile, off-label applications, appropriate dosing strategies, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring procedures, and relevant interactions of vitamin B5. Participants gain insights and knowledge essential for managing cases involving nutritional deficiencies and related conditions.

57738.0	('Camphor', '(r)-camphor', '(1r,4r)-1,7,7-trimethylbicyclo[2.2.1]heptan-2-one', '(1r)-camphor', 'Bornan-2-one')	mouse	"Camphor () is a waxy, colorless solid with a strong aroma. It is classified as a terpenoid and a cyclic ketone. It is found in the wood of the camphor laurel (Cinnamomum camphora), a large evergreen tree found in East Asia; and in the kapur tree (Dryobalanops sp.), a tall timber tree from South East Asia. It also occurs in some other related trees in the laurel family, notably Ocotea usambarensis. Rosemary leaves (Rosmarinus officinalis) contain 0.05 to 0.5% camphor, while camphorweed (Heterotheca) contains some 5%. A major source of camphor in Asia is camphor basil (the parent of African blue basil). Camphor can also be synthetically produced from oil of turpentine. The compound is chiral, existing in two possible enantiomers as shown in the structural diagrams. The structure on the left is the naturally occurring (+)-camphor ((1R,4R)-bornan-2-one), while its mirror image shown on the right is the (−)-camphor ((1S,4S)-bornan-2-one). Camphor has few uses but is of historic significance as a compound that is readily purified from natural sources. == Etymology == The word camphor derived in the 14th century from Old French: camphre, itself from Medieval Latin: camfora, from Arabic: كافور, romanized: kāfūr, perhaps through Sanskrit: कर्पूर, romanized: karpūra, from Tamil: கற்பூரம், romanized: karpooram apparently from Austronesian Malay: kapur 'lime' (chalk). In Old Malay, camphor was called kapur barus, meaning ""the chalk of Barus"", referring to Barus, an ancient port near modern Sibolga on the western coast of Sumatra. This port traded in camphor extracted from the Borneo camphor trees (Dryobalanops aromatica) that were abundant in the region. == Production == === Natural camphor === (+)-camphor has been produced as a forest product for centuries, condensed from the vapor given off by the roasting of wood chips cut from Camphora officinarum, and later by passing steam through the pulverized wood and condensing the vapors. By the early 19th century most camphor tree reserves had been depleted with the remaining large stands in Japan and Taiwan, with Taiwanese production greatly exceeding Japanese. Camphor was one of the primary resources extracted by Taiwan's colonial powers as well as one of the most lucrative. First the Chinese and then the Japanese established monopolies on Taiwanese camphor. In 1868, a British naval force sailed into Anping harbor and the local British representative demanded the end of the Chinese camphor monopoly. After the local imperial representative refused, the British bombarded the town and took the harbor. The ""camphor regulations"" negotiated between the two sides subsequently saw a brief end to the camphor monopoly. (-)-camphor occurs naturally in the essential oil of Matricaria plants. As a result, it's much rarer. === Synthetic camphor === Camphor is produced from alpha-pinene, which is abundant in the oils of coniferous trees and can be distilled from turpentine produced as a side product of chemical pulping. With acetic anhydride as the solvent and with catalysis by a strong acid, alpha-pinene is converted to isobornyl acetate. Hydrolysis of this ester gives isoborneol which can be oxidized to give racemic camphor. A biological enzyme has been proposed for producing only the rare (-) or L-camphor. This EstB esterase from Burkholderia gladioli hydrolyzes only (+)-isobornyl acetate. == Reactions == The reactions of camphor have been extensively examined. Some representative transformations include sulfonation: oxidation with selenium dioxide to camphorquinone . Camphor can also be reduced to isoborneol using sodium borohydride. It can be converted to the alkene bornylene. == Biochemistry == === Biosynthesis === In biosynthesis, camphor is produced from geranyl pyrophosphate, via cyclisation of linaloyl pyrophosphate to bornyl pyrophosphate, followed by hydrolysis to borneol and oxidation to camphor. == Uses == The first significant manmade plastics were low-nitrogen (or ""soluble"") nitrocellulose (pyroxylin) plastics. In the early decades of the plastics industry, camphor was used in immense quantities: 130 as the plasticizer that creates celluloid from nitrocellulose, in nitrocellulose lacquers and other plastics and lacquers. === Alternative medicine and scent === Camphor has been used for its scent, as an embalming fluid, as topical medication, as a manufacturing chemical, and in religious ceremonies. Camphor has been used as a folk medicine over centuries, probably most commonly as a decongestant. Camphor was used in ancient Sumatra to treat sprains, swellings, and inflammation. Camphor also was used for centuries in traditional Chinese medicine for various purposes. In Europe, camphor was used after the Black Death era. In the 20th century, camphor was used as an analeptic by injection, and to induce seizures in schizophrenic people in an attempt to treat psychosis. Camphor has limited use in veterinary medicine by intramuscular injection to treat breathing difficulties in horses. === Topical medication === Camphor is commonly applied as a topical medication as a skin cream or ointment to relieve itching from insect bites, minor skin irritation, or joint pain. It is absorbed in the skin epidermis, where it stimulates nerve endings sensitive to heat and cold, producing a warm sensation when vigorously applied, or a cool sensation when applied gently, indicating its properties as a counterirritant. The action on nerve endings also induces a slight local analgesia. === Respiratory aerosol === Camphor is also used via an aerosol, typically by steam inhalation, sometimes in the form of branded nasal inhaler sticks, to inhibit coughing and relieve upper airway congestion due to the common cold. However, the clinical efficacy of these remedies is challenged. === Other niche uses === Camphor is used by marksmen to blacken the front and rear sights of rifles to prevent the sights from reflecting. This is done by setting light to a small amount of camphor, which burns at a relatively low temperature, and using the soot rising from the flame to deposit a coating on a surface held above it. Historically, this soot blackening was also used to coat barograph record charts. A barracks-room rumour possibly derived from an older rumour about saltpetre holds that soldiers in the Islamic Republic of Iran are dosed with camphor in their daily meals in order to repress their libido and prevent homosexual incidents. === Pest deterrent and preservative === Camphor is believed to be toxic to insects and is thus sometimes used as a repellent. Camphor is used as an alternative to mothballs. Camphor crystals are sometimes used to prevent damage to insect collections by other small insects. It is kept in clothes used on special occasions and festivals, and also in cupboard corners as a cockroach repellent. The smoke of camphor crystal or camphor incense sticks can be used as an environmentally-friendly mosquito repellent. Recent studies have indicated that camphor essential oil can be used as an effective fumigant against red fire ants, as it affects the attacking, climbing, and feeding behavior of major and minor workers. Camphor is also used as an antimicrobial substance. In embalming, camphor oil was one of the ingredients used by ancient Egyptians for mummification. === Perfume === In the ancient Arab world, camphor was a common perfume ingredient. The Chinese referred to the best camphor as ""dragon's brain perfume"", due to its ""pungent and portentous aroma"" and ""centuries of uncertainty over its provenance and mode of origin"". === Culinary uses === One of the earliest known recipes for ice cream dating to the Tang dynasty includes camphor as an ingredient. It was used to flavor leavened bread in ancient Egypt. In ancient and medieval Europe, camphor was used as an ingredient in sweets. It was used in a wide variety of both savory and sweet dishes in medieval Arabic language cookbooks, such as Kitab al-Ṭabikh compiled by ibn Sayyār al-Warrāq in the 10th century. It also was used in sweet and savory dishes in the Ni'matnama, according to a book written in the late 15th century for the sultans of Mandu. It is a main constituent of a spice known as ""edible camphor"" (or kapur), which may be used in traditional South Indian desserts like Payasam and Chakkarai Pongal. === Religious rites === Camphor is widely used in Hindu religious ceremonies. Aarti is performed after placing it on a stand and setting fire to it usually as the last step of puja or devotional worship ritual to one or more deities. Camphor is mentioned in the Quran as being the fragrance of wine given to believers in heaven. == Toxicity == Applied on skin, camphor may cause allergic reactions in some people; when ingested by mouth, camphor cream or ointment is poisonous. In high ingested doses, camphor produces symptoms of irritability, disorientation, lethargy, muscle spasms, vomiting, abdominal cramps, convulsions, and seizures. Lethal doses by ingestion in adults are in the range 50–500 mg/kg (orally). Generally, ingestion of two grams causes serious toxicity and four grams is potentially lethal. Airborne camphor may be toxic if respired by humans. The Permissible Exposure Limit (PEL) for camphor in ambient air is 2 mg/m3 at exposure time (TWA) not more than 8 hours. 200 mg/m3 is considered a very dangerous concentration (IDLH). == History of synthetic camphor == When its use in the nascent chemical industries (discussed below) greatly increased the volume of demand in the late 19th century, potential for changes in supply and in price followed. In 1911 Robert Kennedy Duncan, an industrial chemist and educator, related that the Imperial Japanese government had recently (1907–1908) tried to monopolize the production of natural camphor as a forest product in Asia but that the monopoly was prevented by the development of the total synthesis alternatives, which began in ""purely academic and wholly uncommercial"" form with Gustav Komppa's first report: ""... but it sealed the fate of the Japanese monopoly ... For no sooner was it accomplished than it excited the attention of a new army of investigators—the industrial chemists. The patent offices of the world were soon crowded with alleged commercial syntheses of camphor, and of the favored processes companies were formed to exploit them, factories resulted, and in the incredibly short time of two years after its academic synthesis artificial camphor, every whit as good as the natural product, entered the markets of the world ... And yet artificial camphor does not—and cannot—displace the natural product to an extent sufficient to ruin the camphor-growing industry. Its sole present and probable future function is to act as a permanent check to monopolization, to act as a balance-wheel to regulate prices within reasonable limits."": 133–134 This ongoing check on price growth was confirmed in 1942 in a monograph on DuPont's history, where William S. Dutton said, ""Indispensable in the manufacture of pyroxylin plastics, natural camphor imported from Formosa and selling normally for about 50 cents a pound, reached the high price of $3.75 in 1918 [amid the global trade disruption and high explosives demand that World War I created]. The organic chemists at DuPont replied by synthesizing camphor from the turpentine of southern US pine stumps, with the result that the price of industrial camphor sold in carload lots in 1939 was between 32 cents and 35 cents a pound."": 293 The background of Gustaf Komppa's synthesis was as follows. In the 19th century, it was known that nitric acid oxidizes camphor into camphoric acid. Haller and Blanc published a semisynthesis of camphor from camphoric acid. Although they demonstrated its structure, they were unable to prove it. The first complete total synthesis of camphoric acid was published by Komppa in 1903. Its inputs were diethyl oxalate and 3,3-dimethylpentanoic acid, which reacted by Claisen condensation to yield diketocamphoric acid. Methylation with methyl iodide and a complicated reduction procedure produced camphoric acid. William Perkin published another synthesis a short time later. Previously, some organic compounds (such as urea) had been synthesized in the laboratory as a proof of concept, but camphor was a scarce natural product with a worldwide demand. Komppa realized this, and began industrial production of camphor in Tainionkoski, Finland, in 1907 (with plenty of competition, as Kennedy Duncan reported). A different way of synthesis was developed at the same time by Dr. Karl Stephan from Chemische Fabrik auf Actien. This chemist, who had patented a route to synthesize camphene in 1902, found out that borneol or isoborneol could easily be oxidized with permanganate in benzene solution with unprecedentedly high yields of 95+%, and patented it in 1903. The process was efficient enough to compete with natural camphor, and Japan was forced to lower prices in 1907, but the German company still increased its production, reaching 623 tons in 1913, only to be interrupted by WWI. == See also == 1,4-Dichlorobenzene Citral Eucalyptol Lavender Vaporizer == References == == External links == INCHEM at IPCS (International Programme on Chemical Safety) NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards – Camphor at Centers for Disease Control and Prevention"	Camphor	WIKIPEDIA	('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.18096791207790375), ('OD', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' PERSONAL', -0.054664239287376404), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.00026264708139933646), (' INDUSTR', -0.6380190849304199), ('IAL', 0.0)])

The tripeptide was intragastrically administrated in a dose of 11.5 mg/kg from week 5 to week 8 of the pathological process. The concentrations of glucose, protein, and creatinine in the urine were measured before and then weekly throughout the experiment. In 8 weeks, the markers of activity of the free radical oxidation process (concentration of TBA-reactive substances, total prooxidant activity, and total antioxidant activity, as well as activities of catalase, superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase) were assayed and a morphological study was conducted. After administration of the tripeptide Leu-Ile-Lys for 4 weeks, glucose concentration in the urine decreases by 3-44 times (p<0.001) and protein concentration by 2.3-3.7 times (p=0.007). The concentration of TBA-reactive substances decreased by 1.3 times (p<0.001), and the total antioxidant activity increased by 2.3 times (p<0.001). Administration of the tripeptide Leu-Ile-Lys to animals with experimental diabetes mellitus led to significant improvement of the renal function against the background of significant alleviation of oxidative damage and an increase in the antioxidant protection of the renal tissues. Improvement of the morphofunctional state of tissues and cells of the renal glomerulus was confirmed histologically, in particular, an increase in the number of podocytes by 1.5 times was observed.

27928.0	('Methoxyphenyl)propanoic acid',)	mouse	 α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) receptor stimulation has been proposed to be a common neural mechanism of metabotropic glutamate 2/3 (mGlu2/3) receptor antagonists and an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, ketamine, exerting antidepressant effects in animal models. AMPA receptor stimulation has also been shown to mediate an increase in the extracellular level of serotonin (5-HT) in the medial prefrontal cortex by an mGlu2/3 receptor antagonist in rats. However, involvement of the serotonergic system in the actions of mGlu2/3 receptor antagonists and ketamine is not well understood. We investigated involvement of the serotonergic system in the effects of an mGlu2/3 receptor antagonist, 2S-2-amino-2-(1S,2S-2-carboxycycloprop-1-yl)-3-(xanth-9-yl)propanoic acid (LY341495), and ketamine in a novelty-suppressed feeding (NSF) test in mice. The intraperitoneal administration of LY341495 or ketamine at 30 min prior to the test significantly shortened latency to feed, which was attenuated by an AMPA receptor antagonist, 2,3-dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydr-obenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX). The effects of LY341495 and ketamine were no longer observed in mice pretreated with a tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor, para-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA). Moreover, the effects of LY341495 and ketamine were blocked by a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, N-{2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl}-N-(2-pyridynyl) cyclohexane-carboxamide (WAY100635), but not by a 5-HT2A/2C receptor antagonist, ritanserin. Likewise, an AMPA receptor potentiator, 2,3-dihydro-1,4-benzodioxin-7-yl-(1-piperidyl)methanone (CX546), shortened latency to feed in the NSF test, which was prevented by depletion of 5-HT and blockade of 5-HT1A receptor.

1739.0	('Arginine', 'Arg', '(s)-2-amino-5-guanidinopentanoic acid', 'Larginine', 'H-arg-oh')	mouse	"Arginine is the amino acid with the formula (H2N)(HN)CN(H)(CH2)3CH(NH2)CO2H. The molecule features a guanidino group appended to a standard amino acid framework. At physiological pH, the carboxylic acid is deprotonated (−CO2−) and both the amino and guanidino groups are protonated, resulting in a cation. Only the l-arginine (symbol Arg or R) enantiomer is found naturally. Arg residues are common components of proteins. It is encoded by the codons CGU, CGC, CGA, CGG, AGA, and AGG. The guanidine group in arginine is the precursor for the biosynthesis of nitric oxide. Like all amino acids, it is a white, water-soluble solid. The one-letter symbol R was assigned to arginine for its phonetic similarity. == History == Arginine was first isolated in 1886 from yellow lupin seedlings by the German chemist Ernst Schulze and his assistant Ernst Steiger. He named it from the Greek árgyros (ἄργυρος) meaning ""silver"" due to the silver-white appearance of arginine nitrate crystals. In 1897, Schulze and Ernst Winterstein (1865–1949) determined the structure of arginine. Schulze and Winterstein synthesized arginine from ornithine and cyanamide in 1899, but some doubts about arginine's structure lingered until Sørensen's synthesis of 1910. == Sources == === Production === It is traditionally obtained by hydrolysis of various cheap sources of protein, such as gelatin. It is obtained commercially by fermentation. In this way, 25-35 g/liter can be produced, using glucose as a carbon source. === Dietary sources === Arginine is classified as a semiessential or conditionally essential amino acid, depending on the developmental stage and health status of the individual. Preterm infants are unable to synthesize arginine internally, making the amino acid nutritionally essential for them. Most healthy people do not need to supplement with arginine because it is a component of all protein-containing foods and can be synthesized in the body from glutamine via citrulline. Additional, dietary arginine is necessary for otherwise healthy individuals temporarily under physiological stress, for example during recovery from burns, injury or sepsis, or if either of the major sites of arginine biosynthesis, the small intestine and kidneys, have reduced function, because the small bowel does the first step of the synthesizing process and the kidneys do the second. Arginine is an essential amino acid for birds, as they do not have a urea cycle. For some carnivores, for example cats, dogs and ferrets, arginine is essential, because after a meal, their highly efficient protein catabolism produces large quantities of ammonia which need to be processed through the urea cycle, and if not enough arginine is present, the resulting ammonia toxicity can be lethal. This is not a problem in practice, because meat contains sufficient arginine to avoid this situation. Animal sources of arginine include meat, dairy products, and eggs, and plant sources include seeds of all types, for example grains, beans, and nuts. === Biosynthesis === Arginine is synthesized from citrulline in the urea cycle by the sequential action of the cytosolic enzymes argininosuccinate synthetase and argininosuccinate lyase. This is an energetically costly process, because for each molecule of argininosuccinate that is synthesized, one molecule of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is hydrolyzed to adenosine monophosphate (AMP), consuming two ATP equivalents. The pathways linking arginine, glutamine, and proline are bidirectional. Thus, the net use or production of these amino acids is highly dependent on cell type and developmental stage. Arginine is made by the body as follows. The epithelial cells of the small intestine produce citrulline, primarily from glutamine and glutamate, which is secreted into the bloodstream which carries it to the proximal tubule cells of the kidney, which extract the citrulline and convert it to arginine, which is returned to the blood. This means that impaired small bowel or renal function can reduce arginine synthesis and thus create a dietary requirement for arginine. For such a person, arginine would become ""essential"". Synthesis of arginine from citrulline also occurs at a low level in many other cells, and cellular capacity for arginine synthesis can be markedly increased under circumstances that increase the production of inducible nitric oxide synthase (NOS). This allows citrulline, a byproduct of the NOS-catalyzed production of nitric oxide, to be recycled to arginine in a pathway known as the citrulline to nitric oxide (citrulline-NO) or arginine-citrulline pathway. This is demonstrated by the fact that, in many cell types, nitric oxide synthesis can be supported to some extent by citrulline, and not just by arginine. This recycling is not quantitative, however, because citrulline accumulates in nitric oxide producing cells along with nitrate and nitrite, the stable end-products of nitric oxide breakdown. == Function == Arginine plays an important role in cell division, wound healing, removing ammonia from the body, immune function, and the release of hormones. It is a precursor for the synthesis of nitric oxide (NO), making it important in the regulation of blood pressure. Arginine is necessary for T-cells to function in the body, and can lead to their deregulation if depleted. === Proteins === Arginine's side chain is amphipathic, because at physiological pH it contains a positively charged guanidinium group, which is highly polar, at the end of a hydrophobic aliphatic hydrocarbon chain. Because globular proteins have hydrophobic interiors and hydrophilic surfaces, arginine is typically found on the outside of the protein, where the hydrophilic head group can interact with the polar environment, for example taking part in hydrogen bonding and salt bridges. For this reason, it is frequently found at the interface between two proteins. The aliphatic part of the side chain sometimes remains below the surface of the protein. Arginine residues in proteins can be deiminated by PAD enzymes to form citrulline, in a post-translational modification process called citrullination.This is important in fetal development, is part of the normal immune process, as well as the control of gene expression, but is also significant in autoimmune diseases. Another post-translational modification of arginine involves methylation by protein methyltransferases. === Precursor === Arginine is the immediate precursor of nitric oxide, an important signaling molecule which can act as a second messenger, as well as an intercellular messenger which regulates vasodilation, and also has functions in the immune system's reaction to infection. Arginine is also a precursor for urea, ornithine, and agmatine; is necessary for the synthesis of creatine; and can also be used for the synthesis of polyamines (mainly through ornithine and to a lesser degree through agmatine, citrulline, and glutamate). The presence of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), a close relative, inhibits the nitric oxide reaction; therefore, ADMA is considered a marker for vascular disease, just as L-arginine is considered a sign of a healthy endothelium. == Structure == The amino acid side-chain of arginine consists of a 3-carbon aliphatic straight chain, the distal end of which is capped by a guanidinium group, which has a pKa of 13.8, and is therefore always protonated and positively charged at physiological pH. Because of the conjugation between the double bond and the nitrogen lone pairs, the positive charge is delocalized, enabling the formation of multiple hydrogen bonds. == Research == === Growth hormone === Intravenously administered arginine is used in growth hormone stimulation tests because it stimulates the secretion of growth hormone. A review of clinical trials concluded that oral arginine increases growth hormone, but decreases growth hormone secretion, which is normally associated with exercising. However, a more recent trial reported that although oral arginine increased plasma levels of L-arginine it did not cause an increase in growth hormone. === Herpes-Simplex Virus (Cold sores) === Research from 1964 into amino acid requirements of herpes simplex virus in human cells indicated that ""...the lack of arginine or histidine, and possibly the presence of lysine, would interfere markedly with virus synthesis"", but concludes that ""no ready explanation is available for any of these observations"". Further reviews conclude that ""lysine's efficacy for herpes labialis may lie more in prevention than treatment."" and that ""the use of lysine for decreasing the severity or duration of outbreaks"" is not supported, while further research is needed. A 2017 study concludes that ""clinicians could consider advising patients that there is a theoretical role of lysine supplementation in the prevention of herpes simplex sores but the research evidence is insufficient to back this. Patients with cardiovascular or gallbladder disease should be cautioned and warned of the theoretical risks."" === High blood pressure === A meta-analysis showed that L-arginine reduces blood pressure with pooled estimates of 5.4 mmHg for systolic blood pressure and 2.7 mmHg for diastolic blood pressure. Supplementation with l-arginine reduces diastolic blood pressure and lengthens pregnancy for women with gestational hypertension, including women with high blood pressure as part of pre-eclampsia. It did not lower systolic blood pressure or improve weight at birth. === Schizophrenia === Both liquid chromatography and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometric assays have found that brain tissue of deceased people with schizophrenia shows altered arginine metabolism. Assays also confirmed significantly reduced levels of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), but increased agmatine concentration and glutamate/GABA ratio in the schizophrenia cases. Regression analysis indicated positive correlations between arginase activity and the age of disease onset and between L-ornithine level and the duration of illness. Moreover, cluster analyses revealed that L-arginine and its main metabolites L-citrulline, L-ornithine and agmatine formed distinct groups, which were altered in the schizophrenia group. Despite this, the biological basis of schizophrenia is still poorly understood, a number of factors, such as dopamine hyperfunction, glutamatergic hypofunction, GABAergic deficits, cholinergic system dysfunction, stress vulnerability and neurodevelopmental disruption, have been linked to the aetiology and/or pathophysiology of the disease. === Raynaud's phenomenon === Oral L-arginine has been shown to reverse digital necrosis in Raynaud syndrome. == Safety and potential drug interactions == L-arginine is recognized as safe (GRAS-status) at intakes of up to 20 grams per day. L-arginine is found in many foods, such as fish, poultry, and dairy products, and is used as a dietary supplement. It may interact with various prescription drugs and herbal supplements. == See also == Arginine glutamate AAKG Canavanine and canaline are toxic analogs of arginine and ornithine. == References == == Sources == Griffiths JR, Unwin RD (2016).

65553.0	"('Corticosterone', ""Reichstein's substance h"", ""Kendall's compound b"", 'Corticosteron', ""Reichstein's b"")"	mouse	Corticosterone, also known as 17-deoxycortisol and 11β,21-dihydroxyprogesterone, is a 21-carbon steroid hormone of the corticosteroid type produced in the cortex of the adrenal glands. In the very rare case of congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 17α-hydroxylase deficiency cortisol production is blocked. == Roles == In many species, including amphibians, reptiles, rodents and birds, corticosterone is a main glucocorticoid, involved in regulation of energy, immune reactions, and stress responses. However, in humans, cortisol is the primary glucocorticoid that is produced primarily in the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex. Corticosterone has only weak glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid potencies in humans and is important mainly as an intermediate in the steroidogenic pathway from pregnenolone to aldosterone. Corticosterone is converted to aldosterone by aldosterone synthase, found only in the mitochondria of glomerulosa cells. Glomerulosa cells are found in the zona glomerulosa, which is the most superficial region of endocrine cells in the adrenal cortex. Corticosterone is the precursor molecule to the mineralocorticoid aldosterone, one of the major homeostatic modulators of sodium and potassium levels in vivo. == Release or generation mechanisms == One example of a release pathway relates to UV-B stimulation on the skins of certain amphibians such as the Rough-skinned Newt, Taricha granulosa; this trigger seems to cause the internal generation of corticosterone in that species. == Corticosterone in birds == A sizable amount of research has been done on the effects of corticosterone in birds. A brief survey of this research is below. Corticosterone both inhibits protein synthesis and degrades proteins. Birds with increased levels of corticosterone will have slower feather growth during their molting period and an extended period of poor flight. As a result, many birds have reduced levels of corticosterone when they moult so as to prevent the degradation of their new feathers. Interestingly, higher levels of corticosterone are also associated with a wider range of exploration, despite beforementioned inhibited feather growth. Corticosterone has further developmental effects on birds. Increased levels of corticosterone in chicks leads to increased begging for food and aggressiveness. In the short term this leads to higher chance of obtaining food, but in the long term, increased corticosterone in early life compromises the birds cognitive functioning (problem solving, association of visual cue with food, etc.). Parental response to increased begging by chicks is an increased time foraging for food. This leaves the nest of chicks without protection for increased durations of time. To counter this, during extended periods of food shortage, chicks of some species may suppress corticosterone activity and thus reduce the negative effects elevated corticosterone induces. == Effect on memory == Corticosterone has multiple effects on memory. The main effects are seen through the impact of stress on emotional memories as well as long term memory (LTM). With emotional memories, corticosterone is largely associated with fear memory recognition. Studies have shown that when fear memories are reactivated or consolidated, levels of corticosterone increased. The increase in corticosterone is linked to anxiety relief. This finding depends on the time at which the administration of corticosterone took place as compared to when the fear conditioning took place; corticosterone can either facilitate or interrupt conditioned fear. Not only does corticosterone have effects on emotional memories but memory recognition and consolidation as well. With respect to recognition and long term memories, corticosterone has variable effects. Studies show that the modification of certain chemical and brain processes that affect corticosterone levels can also impact stress effects on memory. In studies on rats, the fluctuations of corticosterone concentration are shown to prevent stress' impairment of recognition memory in lower amounts. These lower levels seem to be linked to the rescue of stress-induced attenuation of CA1 long-term potentiation. When researchers looked at stress effects on LTM, they found many outcomes. In multiple studies, the formation of LTM (tested 24 h later) was found to be enhanced by corticosterone in some studies, while the persistence of LTM (tested at least 1 wk later) was only assisted by corticosterone in the late phase of memory consolidation and reconsolidation. Stress facilitates the consolidation but disrupts the reconsolidation of emotional memory. As mentioned previously, the persistence of LTM is selectively enhanced when stress and corticosterone are administered during the late phase after acquisition, but it is disrupted when stress and corticosterone are administered during the late phase after retrieval of memory. With regards to the persistence of LTM, there is a restricted time window between acquisition and retrieval where persistence is affected. These studies found that while persistence of LTM is selectively affected based on stage of memory, the formation of LTM is left intact after a certain length of time. Up to this point, studies have not agreed as to whether or not these processes are dependent on corticosterone or what even happens based on corticosterone in these processes and how memory is ultimately affected. In the end, corticosterone affects many processes in terms of memory as well as different types of memories themselves. == Additional images == == See also == 11-Deoxycortisol 11-Deoxycorticosterone Cortisol == References == == External links == Corticosterone MS Spectrum	Corticosterone	WIKIPEDIA	('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -2.1008713702030946e-06), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -5.438573680294212e-06), ('US', 0.0)])
93201.0	('N-arachidonoyl l-gaba', 'N-arachidonylgaba', 'Gaba-c20:4')	mouse	 Folic acid (FA; also known as folate or vitamin B One of the mechanisms that tumor cells use to escape the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents, such as Adriamycin, Vinca alkaloids, epipodophyllotoxins, actinomycin D, and paclitaxel (PAC), is to limit their presence inside the cells through the actions of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a protein encoded by the multidrug resistance (MDR-1) gene (1, 2). P-gp is an ATP-dependent transmembrane multidrug transporter that is capable of actively pumping a variety of agents out of cells. Injection of unlabeled efflux pump substrates increases the retention of radioactivity in tumors rather than lessening the retention, as seen with receptor-binding radiotracers. Overexpression of P-gp in tumor cells (such as renal carcinoma, hepatoma, pheochromocytoma, and colon carcinoma) leads to resistance to anticancer drugs (3). P-gp is also present in a variety of normal cells, such as intestinal mucosal cells, hepatocytes, renal proximal tubule epithelial cells, and endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier (4, 5). Calcium channel blockers, cyclosporin A, and its non-immunosuppressive analog PSC 833 are MDR modulators that inhibit transport of P-gp substrates out of cells (6, 7). Sestamibi (MIBI) is a substrate for P-gp. 	Gaba-c20:4	PUBMED	('INFO', [('INFO', -0.0007225605077110231)])
44767.0	('Loliolide', 'Loliolid', 'Digiprolactone', '(3s,5r)-loliolide', 'Caulilide')	mouse	 The production of defensive metabolites in plants can be induced by signaling chemicals released by neighboring plants. Induction is mainly known from volatile aboveground signals, with belowground signals and their underlying mechanisms largely unknown. We demonstrate that (-)-loliolide triggers defensive metabolite responses to competitors, herbivores, and pathogens in seven plant species. We further explore the transcriptional responses of defensive pathways to verify the signaling role of (-)-loliolide in wheat and rice models with well-known defensive metabolites and gene systems. In response to biotic and abiotic stressors, (-)-loliolide is produced and secreted by roots. This, in turn, induces the production of defensive compounds including phenolic acids, flavonoids, terpenoids, alkaloids, benzoxazinoids, and cyanogenic glycosides, regardless of plant species. (-)-Loliolide also triggers the expression of defense-related genes, accompanied by an increase in the concentration of jasmonic acid and hydrogen peroxide (H Plant defense, growth, and reproduction can be modulated by chemicals emitted from neighboring plants, mainly via volatile aboveground signals. However, belowground signals and their underlying control mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we experimentally demonstrate that the root-secreted carotenoid (-)-loliolide mediates both defensive and reproductive responses in wild-type Arabidopsis, a carotenoid-deficient Arabidopsis mutant (szl1-1), and tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana). Wild-type Arabidopsis plants flower later than szl1-1, and they secrete (-)-loliolide into the soil, whereas szl1-1 roots do not. When Arabidopsis and tobacco occur together, wild-type Arabidopsis induces nicotine production and defense-related gene expression in tobacco, whereas szl1-1 impairs this induction but accelerates tobacco flowering. Furthermore, nicotine production and the expression of the key genes involved in nicotine biosynthesis (QPT, PMT1), plant defense (CAT1, SOD1, PR-2a, PI-II, TPI), and flowering (AP1, LFY, SOC1, FT3, FLC) are differently regulated by incubation with wild-type Arabidopsis and szl1-1 root exudates or (-)-loliolide. In particular, (-)-loliolide up-regulated flowering suppressors (FT3 and FLC) and transiently down-regulated flowering stimulators (AP1 and SOC1), delaying tobacco flowering. Therefore, root-secreted (-)-loliolide modulates plant belowground defense and aboveground flowering, yielding critical insights into plant-plant signaling interactions.

They are involved in cervical ripening, membrane rupture, myometrial contraction and inflammation in gestational tissues. Because multiple receptor subtypes for PGE2 and PGF2α exist, coupled with diverse signaling pathways, the effects of PGE2 and PGF2α depend largely on the spatial and temporal expression of these receptors in intrauterine tissues. It appears that PGE2 and PGF2α play different roles in parturition. PGE2 is probably more important for labor onset, while PGF2α may play a more important role in labor accomplishment, which may be attributed to the differential effects of PGE2 and PGF2α in gestational tissues. PGE2 is more powerful than PGF2α in the induction of cervical ripening. In terms of myometrial contraction, PGE2 produces a biphasic effect with an initial contraction and a following relaxation, while PGF2α consistently stimulates myometrial contraction. In the fetal membranes, both PGE2 and PGF2α appear to be involved in the process of membrane rupture. In addition, PGE2 and PGF2α may also participate in the inflammatory process of intrauterine tissues at parturition by stimulating not only neutrophil influx and cytokine production but also cyclooxygenase-2 expression thereby intensifying their own production. This review summarizes the differential roles of PGE2 and PGF2α in parturition with respect to their production and expression of receptor subtypes in gestational tissues. Dissecting the specific mechanisms underlying the effects of PGE2 and PGF2α in parturition may assist in developing specific therapeutic targets for preterm and post-term birth. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic parenchymal lung disease characterized by repetitive alveolar cell injury, myofibroblast proliferation, and excessive extracellular matrix deposition for which unmet need persists for effective therapeutics. The bioactive eicosanoid, prostaglandin F2α, and its cognate receptor FPr (Ptgfr) are implicated as a TGF-β1-independent signaling hub for IPF. To assess this, we leveraged our published murine PF model (IER-SftpcI73T) expressing a disease-associated missense mutation in the surfactant protein C (Sftpc) gene. Tamoxifen-treated IER-SftpcI73T mice developed an early multiphasic alveolitis and transition to spontaneous fibrotic remodeling by 28 days. IER-SftpcI73T mice crossed to a Ptgfr-null (FPr-/-) line showed attenuated weight loss and gene dosage-dependent rescue of mortality compared with FPr+/+ cohorts. IER-SftpcI73T/FPr-/- mice also showed reductions in multiple fibrotic endpoints for which administration of nintedanib was not additive. Single-cell RNA-Seq, pseudotime analysis, and in vitro assays demonstrated Ptgfr expression predominantly within adventitial fibroblasts, which were reprogrammed to an ""inflammatory/transitional"" cell state in a PGF2α /FPr-dependent manner. Collectively, the findings provide evidence for a role for PGF2α signaling in IPF, mechanistically identify a susceptible fibroblast subpopulation, and establish a benchmark effect size for disruption of this pathway in mitigating fibrotic lung remodeling. F2-isoprostane is one of the members of biologically active prostaglandins. It is considered a reliable marker of oxidative stress. This study aimed at investigating and studying the hypothesis of the possible role of prostaglandin F2-alpha (PGF2α) in the pathogenesis of vitiligo and to know if there is a possibility of using it in therapy. This case-control study involved 30 patients with nonsegmental vitiligo and 30 healthy sex- and age-matched controls over a period of 7 months. Skin biopsies were taken from lesional and nonlesional vitiliginous skin of patients and from normal skin of controls for measurement of PGF2α in tissue by ELISA. The tissue levels of PGF2α in vitiligo patients were significantly higher in both lesional and nonlesional skin than in healthy controls (P < 0.001). The tissue levels of PGF2α in lesional skin were significantly higher than in nonlesional skin (P < 0.001). Based on the fact that PGF2α is a reliable biomarker of oxidative stress, in addition to our results that revealed higher tissue levels of PGF2α in vitiliginous skin than in healthy skin, we can conclude that PGF2α may be incriminated in the pathogenesis of vitiligo. This finding could help in the treatment of this disease by using anti-PGF2α drugs."

(E)-4-Hydroxynon-2-enal 1 (trans-4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, HNE) is one of the most abundant products of LPO. Reactions of HNE with DNA and proteins are responsible for its mutagenic and toxic effects. On the other hand, HNE is regarded as a key molecule in stress mediated cell cycle signaling. LPO generates racemic HNE (rac-1); however, it is expected that the individual enantiomers will behave differently in their interactions with cell components. The study of HNE stereochemistry in its chemical and biochemical interactions is hindered by the lack of expedient methods for preparation of pure enantiomers. This study presents one step synthesis of HNE in a cross-metathesis reaction between the commercially available oct-1-en-3-ol and acrolein in the presence of 2nd generation Grubbs catalyst. The use in the metathesis reaction of enantiomers of oct-1-en-3-ol obtained via Candida antarctica lipase resolution of the racemate allowed us to prepare of 4-(R)- and 4-(S)-enantiomers of HNE (R-1 and S-1, respectively) with excellent optical purity (97.5 and 98.4% ee, respectively) and good chemical yields (70%). ( E)-4-Hydroxynon-2-enal (HNE), an electrophilic bifunctional cytotoxic lipid peroxidation product, forms covalent adducts with nucleophilic side chains of amino acid residues. HNE-derived adducts have been implicated in many pathophysiological processes including atherosclerosis, diabetes, and Alzheimer's disease. Tritium- and deuterium-labeled HNE ( d 4-HNE) were used orthogonally to study adduction with proteins and individual nucleophilic groups of histidyl, lysyl, and cysteine residues. Using tritium-labeled HNE, we detected the binding of 486 molecules of HNE per low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particle, significantly more than the total number of all reactive nucleophiles in the LDL particle. This suggests the formation of adducts that incorporate multiple molecules of HNE with some nucleophilic amino acid side chains. We also found that the reaction of a 1:1 mixture of d 4-HNE and d 0-HNE with N-acetylhistidine, N-acetyl-Gly-Lys-OMe, or N-acetyl cysteine generates 1:1, 2:1, and 3:1 adducts, which exhibit unique mass spectral signatures that aid in structural characterization.

92540.0	('N-arachidonylglycine', 'N-arachidonoylglycine', 'Nagly', 'N-arachidonoyl glycine', 'Arachidonoyl glycine')	mouse	"N-Arachidonylglycine (NAGly) is a carboxylic metabolite of the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA). Since it was first synthesized in 1996, NAGly has been a primary focus of the relatively contemporary field of lipidomics due to its wide range of signaling targets in the brain, the immune system and throughout various other bodily systems. In combination with 2‐arachidonoyl glycerol (2‐AG), NAGly has enabled the identification of a family of lipids often referred to as endocannabinoids. Recently, NAGly has been found to bind to G-protein coupled receptor 18 (GPR18), the putative abnormal cannabidiol receptor. NaGly is an endogenous inhibitor of fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) and thereby increases the ethanolamide endocannabinoids AEA, oleoylethanolamide (OEA) and palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) levels. NaGly is found throughout the body and research on its explicit functions is ongoing. == Biosynthesis and degradation == The biosynthesis and degradation of NaGly is not completely understood. Using biochemical approaches, two proposed pathways include: 1) enzymatic conjugation of arachidonic acid and glycine and 2) the oxidative metabolism of the endogenous cannabinoid anandamide. In support of the former ""direct"" pathway of arachidonic acid and glycine conjugation and hydrolysis, the secreted enzyme PM20D1 and the intracellular amidase FAAH has been identified as enzymatic regulators of NAGly metabolism in mice. == Research == === Effects on the nervous system === NAGly has been hypothesized to have a neurophysiological function of pain suppression, supported by evidence that it suppresses formalin-induced pain behavior in rats. In particular, peripherally administered NAGly inhibited phase 2 pain behavior, suggesting either a direct suppression of nociceptive afferents on the nerve or an indirect modulation of the afferents' interstitial environment. In either case, these findings hold promise for NAGly as a means of mitigating postoperative or chronic pain. NAGly is also effective in acute pain models, reducing mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia induced by intraplantar injection of Fruend's complete adjuvant. Similar mechanical allydonia induced by partial ligation of the sciatic nerve was also reduced by NaGly. Other arachidonic acid-amino acid conjugates did not have the same effects and the actions of NaGly were not affected by cannabinoid receptor agonists in either study, suggesting a novel non-cannabinoid receptor mediated approach to alleviate inflammatory pain. NaGly was shown to be endogenous ligand for the G-protein couple receptor GPR92 along with farnesyl pyrophosphate. In the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), where GPR92 was found to be localized NaGly increased intracellular calcium levels in DRG neurons, indicating a role of NaGly in the sensory nervous system through the activation of GPR92. === Effects on the immune system === NAGly has been the focus of research on the immune system because of its antinociceptive effects and inhibitory action on components of the immune system. Specifically, it significantly inhibited TNFα and IFNγ production, and it shows potential as a therapeutic treatment for chronic inflammation. Moreover, NAGly has been shown to act as a substrate for cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), the enzyme primarily known for producing prostaglandins associated with increases in inflammation and hyperalgesia. In many mammalian tissues that express COX-2, significant levels of NAGly are naturally present, and in these tissues COX-2 selectively metabolizes NAGly prostaglandin (PG) H2 glycine and HETE-Gly. === Cell migration === NAGly has been hypothesized to induce cell migration in BV-2 microglia cells. The same research suggests that this migration occurs through GPR18. This was verified using GPR18 transfected HEK-293 cells. The same migration wasn't witnessed using non-transfected and GPR55 transfected HEK-293. Additionally, tetrahydrocannabinol and NaGly are full agonists at the GPR18 receptors and induce migration in human endometrial HEC-1B cells. Understanding functions of NaGly in such structures provides a promising future in helping treat diseases such as endometriosis. === Cellular respiration === NAGly powerfully stimulates oxygen consumption in multiple cell lines, including murine C2C12 myoblasts and human HEK293T cells. This respiratory bioactivity of NAGly is by increased uncoupled (state4u) mitochondrial respiration and depends on the presence of fatty acid desaturation. NAGly respiration bioactivity can be also abrogated in the presence of serum albumin, which functions as an NAGly carrier in murine blood plasma. === Other targets === ==== Insulin secretion ==== NaGly was identified as a novel insulin secretagogue and was shown to increase intracellular calcium concentration through stimulation of voltage dependent calcium channels. Additionally, this action was dependent on extracellular glucose level. ==== Additional biochemical interactions ==== NaGly has been shown to inhibit the glycine transporter GLYT2a in a non-competitive fashion with arachidonic acid and secondary messenger systems of GLYT2a, suggesting a novel recognition site for the N-arachidonyl amino acids, especially because other conjugated amino acids had similar effects. == References =="	N-arachidonylglycine	WIKIPEDIA	('ENDOGENOUS', [('END', -1.9743012671824545e-05), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -4.246537173457909e-06), ('US', 0.0)])
2057.0	('Glutamine', 'Levoglutamide', 'Glutamic acid amide', 'Cebrogen', 'Stimulina')	mouse	Glutamine (symbol Gln or Q) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Its side chain is similar to that of glutamic acid, except the carboxylic acid group is replaced by an amide. It is classified as a charge-neutral, polar amino acid. It is non-essential and conditionally essential in humans, meaning the body can usually synthesize sufficient amounts of it, but in some instances of stress, the body's demand for glutamine increases, and glutamine must be obtained from the diet. It is encoded by the codons CAA and CAG. It is named after glutamic acid, which in turn is named after its discovery in cereal proteins, gluten. In human blood, glutamine is the most abundant free amino acid. The dietary sources of glutamine include especially the protein-rich foods like beef, chicken, fish, dairy products, eggs, vegetables like beans, beets, cabbage, spinach, carrots, parsley, vegetable juices and also in wheat, papaya, Brussels sprouts, celery, kale and fermented foods like miso. The one-letter symbol Q for glutamine was assigned in alphabetical sequence to N for asparagine, being larger by merely one methylene –CH2– group. Note that P was used for proline, and O was avoided due to similarity with D. The mnemonic Qlutamine was also proposed. == Functions == Glutamine plays a role in a variety of biochemical functions: Protein synthesis, as any other of the 20 proteinogenic amino acids Lipid synthesis, especially by cancer cells. Regulation of acid-base balance in the kidney by producing ammonium Cellular energy, as a source, next to glucose Nitrogen donation for many anabolic processes, including the synthesis of purines Carbon donation, as a source, refilling the citric acid cycle Nontoxic transporter of ammonia in the blood circulation. Integrity of healthy intestinal mucosa, though small randomized trials have shown no benefit in Crohn's disease. === Roles in metabolism === Glutamine maintains redox balance by participating in glutathione synthesis and contributing to anabolic processes such as lipid synthesis by reductive carboxylation. Glutamine provides a source of carbon and nitrogen for use in other metabolic processes. Glutamine is present in serum at higher concentrations than other amino acids and is essential for many cellular functions. Examples include the synthesis of nucleotides and non-essential amino acids. One of the most important functions of glutamine is its ability to be converted into α-KG, which helps to maintain the flow of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, generating ATP via the electron carriers NADH and FADH2. The highest consumption of glutamine occurs in the cells of the intestines, kidney cells (where it is used for acid-base balance), activated immune cells, and many cancer cells. == Production == Glutamine is produced industrially using mutants of Brevibacterium flavum, which gives ca. 40 g/L in 2 days using glucose as a carbon source. === Biosynthesis === Glutamine synthesis from glutamate and ammonia is catalyzed by the enzyme glutamine synthetase. The majority of glutamine production occurs in muscle tissue, accounting for about 90% of all glutamine synthesized. Glutamine is also released, in small amounts, by the lungs and brain. Although the liver is capable of glutamine synthesis, its role in glutamine metabolism is more regulatory than productive, as the liver takes up glutamine derived from the gut via the hepatic portal system. == Uses == === Nutrition === Glutamine is the most abundant naturally occurring, nonessential amino acid in the human body, and one of the few amino acids that can directly cross the blood–brain barrier. Humans obtain glutamine through catabolism of proteins in foods they eat. In states where tissue is being built or repaired, like growth of babies, or healing from wounds or severe illness, glutamine becomes conditionally essential. === Sickle cell disease === In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved L-glutamine oral powder, marketed as Endari, to reduce severe complications of sickle cell disease in people aged five years and older with the disorder. The safety and efficacy of L-glutamine oral powder were studied in a randomized trial of subjects ages five to 58 years old with sickle cell disease who had two or more painful crises within the 12 months prior to enrollment in the trial. Subjects were assigned randomly to treatment with L-glutamine oral powder or placebo, and the effect of treatment was evaluated over 48 weeks. Subjects who were treated with L-glutamine oral powder experienced fewer hospital visits for pain treated with a parenterally administered narcotic or ketorolac (sickle cell crises), on average, compared to subjects who received a placebo (median 3 vs. median 4), fewer hospitalizations for sickle cell pain (median 2 vs. median 3), and fewer days in the hospital (median 6.5 days vs. median 11 days). Subjects who received L-glutamine oral powder also had fewer occurrences of acute chest syndrome (a life-threatening complication of sickle cell disease) compared with patients who received a placebo (8.6 percent vs. 23.1 percent). Common side effects of L-glutamine oral powder include constipation, nausea, headache, abdominal pain, cough, pain in the extremities, back pain and chest pain. L-glutamine oral powder received orphan drug designation. The FDA granted the approval of Endari to Emmaus Medical Inc. === Medical food === Glutamine is marketed as medical food and is prescribed when a medical professional believes a person in their care needs supplementary glutamine due to metabolic demands beyond what can be met by endogenous synthesis or diet. == Safety == Glutamine is safe in adults and in preterm infants. Although glutamine is metabolized to glutamate and ammonia, both of which have neurological effects, their concentrations are not increased much, and no adverse neurological effects were detected. The observed safe level for supplemental L-glutamine in normal healthy adults is 14 g/day. Adverse effects of glutamine have been described for people receiving home parenteral nutrition and those with liver-function abnormalities. Although glutamine has no effect on the proliferation of tumor cells, it is still possible that glutamine supplementation may be detrimental in some cancer types. Ceasing glutamine supplementation in people adapted to very high consumption may initiate a withdrawal effect, raising the risk of health problems such as infections or impaired integrity of the intestine. == Structure == Glutamine can exist in either of two enantiomeric forms, L-glutamine and D-glutamine. The L-form is found in nature. Glutamine contains an α-amino group which is in the protonated −NH3+ form under biological conditions and a carboxylic acid group which is in the deprotonated −COO− form, known as carboxylate, under physiological conditions. == Research == Glutamine mouthwash may be useful to prevent oral mucositis in people undergoing chemotherapy but intravenous glutamine does not appear useful to prevent mucositis in the GI tract. Glutamine supplementation was thought to have potential to reduce complications in people who are critically ill or who have had abdominal surgery but this was based on poor quality clinical trials. Supplementation does not appear to be useful in adults or children with Crohn's disease or inflammatory bowel disease, but clinical studies as of 2016 were underpowered. Supplementation does not appear to have an effect in infants with significant problems of the stomach or intestines. Some athletes use L-glutamine as supplement. Studies support the positive effects of the chronic oral administration of the supplement on the injury and inflammation induced by intense aerobic and exhaustive exercise, but the effects on muscle recovery from weight training are unclear. Stress conditions for plants (drought, injury, soil salnity) cause the synthesis of such plant enzymes as superoxide dismutase, L-ascorbate oxidase, and Delta 1 DNA polymerase. Limiting this process, initiated by the conditions of strong soil salinity can be achieved by administering exogenous glutamine to plants. The decrease in the level of expression of genes responsible for the synthesis of superoxide dismutase increases with the increase in glutamine concentration. == See also == Isoglutamine Trinucleotide repeat disorder PolyQ tract == References == == External links == Glutamine spectra acquired through mass spectroscopy	Glutamine	WIKIPEDIA	('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD, MEDICAL, PERSONAL CARE', [('END', -0.01675955019891262), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -2.5776860184123507e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', 0.0), (' FOOD', -0.061996035277843475), (',', -9.088346359931165e-07), (' MED', -0.0013298832345753908), ('ICAL', -3.128163257315464e-07), (',', -0.4751656651496887), (' PERSONAL', -0.009810633957386017), (' CARE', 0.0)])
3580.0	('Guanine', 'Guanin', 'Mearlmaid', 'Guanine enol', 'Pearl essence')	mouse	"Guanine ( ) (symbol G or Gua) is one of the four main nucleotide bases found in the nucleic acids DNA and RNA, the others being adenine, cytosine, and thymine (uracil in RNA). In DNA, guanine is paired with cytosine. The guanine nucleoside is called guanosine. With the formula C5H5N5O, guanine is a derivative of purine, consisting of a fused pyrimidine-imidazole ring system with conjugated double bonds. This unsaturated arrangement means the bicyclic molecule is planar. == Properties == Guanine, along with adenine and cytosine, is present in both DNA and RNA, whereas thymine is usually seen only in DNA, and uracil only in RNA. Guanine has two tautomeric forms, the major keto form (see figures) and rare enol form. It binds to cytosine through three hydrogen bonds. In cytosine, the amino group acts as the hydrogen bond donor and the C-2 carbonyl and the N-3 amine as the hydrogen-bond acceptors. Guanine has the C-6 carbonyl group that acts as the hydrogen bond acceptor, while a group at N-1 and the amino group at C-2 act as the hydrogen bond donors. Guanine can be hydrolyzed with strong acid to glycine, ammonia, carbon dioxide, and carbon monoxide. First, guanine gets deaminated to become xanthine. Guanine oxidizes more readily than adenine, the other purine-derivative base in DNA. Its high melting point of 350 °C reflects the intermolecular hydrogen bonding between the oxo and amino groups in the molecules in the crystal. Because of this intermolecular bonding, guanine is relatively insoluble in water, but it is soluble in dilute acids and bases. == History == The first isolation of guanine was reported in 1844 by the German chemist Julius Bodo Unger (1819–1885), who obtained it as a mineral formed from the excreta of sea birds, which is known as guano and which was used as a source of fertilizer; guanine was named in 1846. Between 1882 and 1906, Emil Fischer determined the structure and also showed that uric acid can be converted to guanine. == Synthesis == Trace amounts of guanine form by the polymerization of ammonium cyanide (NH4CN). Two experiments conducted by Levy et al. showed that heating 10 mol·L−1 NH4CN at 80 °C for 24 hours gave a yield of 0.0007%, while using 0.1 mol·L−1 NH4CN frozen at −20 °C for 25 years gave a 0.0035% yield. These results indicate guanine could arise in frozen regions of the primitive earth. In 1984, Yuasa reported a 0.00017% yield of guanine after the electrical discharge of NH3, CH4, C2H6, and 50 mL of water, followed by a subsequent acid hydrolysis. However, it is unknown whether the presence of guanine was not simply a resultant contaminant of the reaction. 10NH3 + 2CH4 + 4C2H6 + 2H2O → 2C5H8N5O (guanine) + 25H2 A Fischer–Tropsch synthesis can also be used to form guanine, along with adenine, uracil, and thymine. Heating an equimolar gas mixture of CO, H2, and NH3 to 700 °C for 15 to 24 minutes, followed by quick cooling and then sustained reheating to 100 to 200 °C for 16 to 44 hours with an alumina catalyst, yielded guanine and uracil: 10CO + H2 + 10NH3 → 2C5H8N5O (guanine) + 8H2O Another possible abiotic route was explored by quenching a 90% N2–10%CO–H2O gas mixture high-temperature plasma. Traube's synthesis involves heating 2,4,5-triamino-1,6-dihydro-6-oxypyrimidine (as the sulfate) with formic acid for several hours. == Biosynthesis == Guanine is not synthesized de novo. Instead, it is split from the more complex molecule guanosine by the enzyme guanosine phosphorylase: guanosine + phosphate ⇌ {\displaystyle \rightleftharpoons } guanine + alpha-D-ribose 1-phosphate Guanine can be synthesized de novo, with the rate-limiting enzyme of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. == Other occurrences and biological uses == The word guanine derives from the Spanish loanword guano ('bird/bat droppings'), which itself is from the Quechua word wanu, meaning 'dung'. As the Oxford English Dictionary notes, guanine is ""A white amorphous substance obtained abundantly from guano, forming a constituent of the excrement of birds"". In 1656 in Paris, a Mr. Jaquin extracted from the scales of the fish Alburnus alburnus so-called ""pearl essence"", which is crystalline guanine. In the cosmetics industry, crystalline guanine is used as an additive to various products (e.g., shampoos), where it provides a pearly iridescent effect. It is also used in metallic paints and simulated pearls and plastics. It provides shimmering luster to eye shadow and nail polish. Facial treatments using the droppings, or guano, from Japanese nightingales have been used in Japan and elsewhere, because the guanine in the droppings makes the skin look paler. Guanine crystals are rhombic platelets composed of multiple transparent layers, but they have a high index of refraction that partially reflects and transmits light from layer to layer, thus producing a pearly luster. It can be applied by spray, painting, or dipping. It may irritate the eyes. Its alternatives are mica, faux pearl (from ground shells), and aluminium and bronze particles. Guanine has a very wide variety of biological uses that include a range of functions ranging in both complexity and versatility. These include camouflage, display, and vision among other purposes. Spiders, scorpions, and some amphibians convert ammonia, as a product of protein metabolism in the cells, to guanine, as it can be excreted with minimal water loss. Guanine is also found in specialized skin cells of fish called iridocytes (e.g., the sturgeon), as well as being present in the reflective deposits of the eyes of deep-sea fish and some reptiles, such as crocodiles and chameleons. On 8 August 2011, a report, based on NASA studies with meteorites found on Earth, was published suggesting building blocks of DNA and RNA (guanine, adenine and related organic molecules) may have been formed extra-terrestrially in outer space. == See also == Cytosine Guanine deaminase == References == == External links == Guanine MS Spectrum Guanine at chemicalland21.com"	Guanine	WIKIPEDIA	('ENDOGENOUS, PERSONAL CARE', [('END', -0.00013512482109945267), ('OG', 0.0), ('ENO', -7.896309739408025e-07), ('US', 0.0), (',', -8.180258191714529e-06), (' PERSONAL', -0.011132710613310337), (' CARE', 0.0)])

Hyocholic acid differs from the primary bile acids found in humans by having a third hydroxyl group in the α-conformation at the 6-position, unlike cholic acid, which has a 12-hydroxyl, and chenodeoxycholic acid which has neither a 6- or 12-hydroxyl. It also differs from the muricholic acids found in rodents, as they are 6β-hydroxylated, and can have the 7-hydroxyl in either the α- or β- positions, forming α- or β-muricholic acids. Hyocholic acid is conjugated in the liver before secretion with taurine or with glycine to give taurohyocholate or glycohyocholates. Bacterial 7α-dehydroxylation in the colon produces the secondary bile acid, hyodeoxycholic acid. Epimerization of the 7-hydroxyl to the β-position is found in ω-muricholic acid (also known as β-hyocholic acid).

Recently, krill oil, which contains phospholipids, has been in the spotlight as an n-3 PUFA-containing oil.  Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), one of the N-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs), is a major active ingredient of fish that contributes to improve dyslipidemia. Recently, we demonstrated that 8-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (8-HEPE) had a more positive effect on metabolic syndrome than EPA, and that 8-HEPE induced peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)α activation in the liver. We investigated the effects of 8-HEPE-concentrated materials from Pacific krill on dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor-deficient (LDLR-KO) mice. Eight-week-old male LDLR-KO mice were fed a Western diet (0.15% cholesterol, WD), WD supplemented with 8-HEPE-concentrated materials from Pacific krill (8-HEPE included; WD +8-HEPE), or a standard diet (SD) for eighteen weeks, respectively. Murine J774.1 macrophages were incubated in the absence or presence of 8-HEPE (50 µM) or EPA (50 µM). 8-HEPE-concentrated materials significantly increased the plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol level, and decreased the plasma LDL-cholesterol and hepatic triglyceride levels in WD-fed LDLR-KO mice. Moreover, the rate of Oil Red O-positive staining was higher in the liver of WD-fed LDLR-KO mice than in that of 8-HEPE + WD-fed LDLR-KO mice. 8-HEPE but not EPA significantly increased gene expression levels of ABCA1, CD36, and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in murine J774.1 macrophages compared with those in the control. These results suggest that 8-HEPE-concentrated materials improve dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis increasing ABCA1, CD36, and IL-6 gene expressions in macrophages.	8-hepe	PUBMED	('INFO', [('INFO', -0.2841184437274933)])

Emerging evidence suggests that endogenous biomarkers, particularly coproporphyrin-I (CP-I), can be used to assess in vivo OATP1B activity. The present work under the International Consortium for Innovation and Quality in Pharmaceutical Development was aimed primarily at assessing CP-I as a biomarker for informing OATP1B DDI risk. Literature and unpublished CP-I data along with pertinent in vitro and clinical DDI information were collected to identify DDIs primarily involving OATP1B inhibition and assess the relationship between OATP1B substrate drug and CP-I exposure changes. Static models to predict changes in exposure of CP-I, as a selective OATP1B substrate, were also evaluated. Significant correlations were observed between CP-I area under the curve ratio (AUCR) or maximum concentration ratio (C The ratio of urinary coproporphyrin (UCP) I to total urinary coproporphyrin I and III [UCP {I/(I + III)]] serves as a biomarker of the ATP-binding cassette, sub-family C, member 2 (ABCC2) function. The aim of this study was to clarify the characteristics of the developmental pattern of UCP [I/(I + III)] in order to estimate ABCC2 function in children, especially in the neonatal period, by measuring it throughout the entirety of childhood. Measurement of UCP [I/(I + III)] was done high-performance liquid chromatography, using urine samples collected from children from 1 day to 15 years old, involving one sample per child. Urine samples from children with liver and kidney disease and urinary tract infection were excluded. UCP [I/(I + III)] varied widely in infants younger than 6 months old, and was ≥0.3 in 80% of the infants. In contrast, it decreased to <0.30, the lowest, at 1-2 years old. In the 0-6-month-old group, no significant correlation was noted between postnatal age and UCP [I/(I + III)], but a moderate inverse correlation was noted between corrected gestational age and UCP [I/(I + III)]. UCP [I/(I + III)] is inversely correlated with corrected gestational age and is lowest at 1-2 years old. This suggests that ABCC2 activity is correlated with corrected gestational age and is highest at 1-2 years old. Coproporphyrin (CP)-I and CP-III are the markers of organic anion-transporting polypeptides' (OATPs) activities, and they are porphyrin metabolites that originate from heme synthesis.

The mucoadhesive properties of GMO and GML were demonstrated in vitro by a 'flushing' bioadhesion test system and a tensiometric method. The flushing system was validated with GMO. Mucoadhesion is influenced by the drug and excipient added, their concentrations, and the ability to form especially the cubic phase. It has been shown that the cubic phase is mucoadhesive when formed on wet mucosa, such as rabbit jejunum, and that drug added to the precursor formulation is incorporated in the cubic phase formed. Tensiometric measurements have shown that the unswollen monoglycerides have the greatest mucoadhesion, followed by the partly swollen lamellar phase and the fully swollen cubic phase. The values found for the work of adhesion were in the range 0.007-0.048 mJcm-2. The mechanism of mucoadhesion is unspecific and probably involves dehydration of the mucosa.

13236.0	('Tyramine', 'P-tyramine', 'Uteramine', 'Tyrosamine', 'Tocosine')	mouse	"Tyramine ( TY-rə-meen) (also spelled tyramin), also known under several other names, is a naturally occurring trace amine derived from the amino acid tyrosine. Tyramine acts as a catecholamine releasing agent. Notably, it is unable to cross the blood-brain barrier, resulting in only non-psychoactive peripheral sympathomimetic effects following ingestion. A hypertensive crisis can result, however, from ingestion of tyramine-rich foods in conjunction with the use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). == Occurrence == Tyramine occurs widely in plants and animals, and is metabolized by various enzymes, including monoamine oxidases. In foods, it often is produced by the decarboxylation of tyrosine during fermentation or decay. Foods that are fermented, cured, pickled, aged, or spoiled have high amounts of tyramine. Tyramine levels go up when foods are at room temperature or go past their freshness date. Specific foods containing considerable amounts of tyramine include: Strong or aged cheeses: cheddar, Swiss, Parmesan, Stilton, Gorgonzola or blue cheeses, Camembert, feta, Muenster Meats that are cured, smoked, or processed: such as salami, pepperoni, dry sausages, hot dogs, bologna, bacon, corned beef, pickled or smoked fish, caviar, aged chicken livers, soups or gravies made from meat extract Pickled or fermented foods: sauerkraut, kimchi, tofu (especially stinky tofu), pickles, miso soup, bean curd, tempeh, sourdough breads Condiments: soy, shrimp, fish, miso, teriyaki, and bouillon-based sauces Drinks: beer (especially tap or home-brewed), vermouth, red wine, sherry, liqueurs Beans, vegetables, and fruits: fermented or pickled vegetables, overripe fruits Chocolate Scientists more and more consider tyramine in food as an aspect of safety. They propose projects of regulations aimed to enact control of biogenic amines in food by various strategies, including usage of proper fermentation starters, or preventing their decarboxylase activity. Some authors wrote that this has already given positive results, and tyramine content in food is now lower than it has been in the past. === In plants === Mistletoe (toxic and not used by humans as a food, but historically used as a medicine). === In animals === Tyramine also plays a role in animals including: In behavioral and motor functions in Caenorhabditis elegans; Locusta migratoria swarming behaviour; and various nervous roles in Rhipicephalus, Apis, Locusta, Periplaneta, Drosophila, Phormia, Papilio, Bombyx, Chilo, Heliothis, Mamestra, Agrotis, and Anopheles. == Biological activity == Tyramine is a norepinephrine and dopamine releasing agent (NDRA) and indirectly acting sympathomimetic. Evidence for the presence of tyramine in the human brain has been confirmed by postmortem analysis. Additionally, the possibility that tyramine acts directly as a neuromodulator was revealed by the discovery of a G protein-coupled receptor with high affinity for tyramine, called the trace amine-associated receptor (TAAR1). The TAAR1 receptor is found in the brain, as well as peripheral tissues, including the kidneys. Tyramine is a full agonist of the TAAR1 in rodents and humans. Tyramine is physiologically metabolized by monoamine oxidases (primarily MAO-A), FMO3, PNMT, DBH, and CYP2D6. Human monoamine oxidase enzymes metabolize tyramine into 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde. If monoamine metabolism is compromised by the use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and foods high in tyramine are ingested, a hypertensive crisis can result, as tyramine also can displace stored monoamines, such as dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine, from pre-synaptic vesicles. Tyramine is considered a ""false neurotransmitter"", as it enters noradrenergic nerve terminals and displaces large amounts of norepinephrine, which enters the blood stream and causes vasoconstriction. Additionally, cocaine has been found to block blood pressure rise that is originally attributed to tyramine, which is explained by the blocking of adrenaline by cocaine from reabsorption to the brain. The first signs of this effect were discovered by a British pharmacist who noticed that his wife, who at the time was on MAOI medication, had severe headaches when eating cheese. For this reason, it is still called the ""cheese reaction"" or ""cheese crisis"", although other foods can cause the same problem. Most processed cheeses do not contain enough tyramine to cause hypertensive effects, although some aged cheeses (such as Stilton) do. A large dietary intake of tyramine (or a dietary intake of tyramine while taking MAO inhibitors) can cause the tyramine pressor response, which is defined as an increase in systolic blood pressure of 30 mmHg or more. The increased release of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) from neuronal cytosol or storage vesicles is thought to cause the vasoconstriction and increased heart rate and blood pressure of the pressor response. In severe cases, adrenergic crisis can occur. Although the mechanism is unclear, tyramine ingestion also triggers migraine attacks in sensitive individuals and can even lead to stroke. Vasodilation, dopamine, and circulatory factors are all implicated in the migraines. Double-blind trials suggest that the effects of tyramine on migraine may be adrenergic. Research reveals a possible link between migraines and elevated levels of tyramine. A 2007 review published in Neurological Sciences presented data showing migraine and cluster diseases are characterized by an increase of circulating neurotransmitters and neuromodulators (including tyramine, octopamine, and synephrine) in the hypothalamus, amygdala, and dopaminergic system. People with migraine are over-represented among those with inadequate natural monoamine oxidase, resulting in similar problems to individuals taking MAO inhibitors. Many migraine attack triggers are high in tyramine. If one has had repeated exposure to tyramine, however, there is a decreased pressor response; tyramine is degraded to octopamine, which is subsequently packaged in synaptic vesicles with norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Therefore, after repeated tyramine exposure, these vesicles contain an increased amount of octopamine and a relatively reduced amount of norepinephrine. When these vesicles are secreted upon tyramine ingestion, there is a decreased pressor response, as less norepinephrine is secreted into the synapse, and octopamine does not activate alpha or beta adrenergic receptors. When using a MAO inhibitor (MAOI), an intake of approximately 10 to 25 mg of tyramine is required for a severe reaction, compared to 6 to 10 mg for a mild reaction. Tyramine, like phenethylamine, is a monoaminergic activity enhancer (MAE) of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine in addition to its catecholamine-releasing activity. That is, it enhances the action potential-mediated release of these monoamine neurotransmitters. The compound is active as a MAE at much lower concentrations than the concentrations at which it induces the release of catecholamines. The MAE actions of tyramine and other MAEs may be mediated by TAAR1 agonism. == Biosynthesis == Biochemically, tyramine is produced by the decarboxylation of tyrosine via the action of the enzyme tyrosine decarboxylase. Tyramine can, in turn, be converted to methylated alkaloid derivatives N-methyltyramine, N,N-dimethyltyramine (hordenine), and N,N,N-trimethyltyramine (candicine). In humans, tyramine is produced from tyrosine, as shown in the following diagram. == Chemistry == In the laboratory, tyramine can be synthesized in various ways, in particular by the decarboxylation of tyrosine. == Society and culture == === Legal status === ==== United States ==== Tyramine is a Schedule I controlled substance, categorized as a hallucinogen, making it illegal to buy, sell, or possess in the state of Florida without a license at any purity level or any form whatsoever. The language in the Florida statute says tyramine is illegal in ""any material, compound, mixture, or preparation that contains any quantity of [tyramine] or that contains any of [its] salts, isomers, including optical, positional, or geometric isomers, and salts of isomers, if the existence of such salts, isomers, and salts of isomers is possible within the specific chemical designation."" This ban is likely the product of lawmakers overly eager to ban substituted phenethylamines, which tyramine is, in the mistaken belief that ring-substituted phenethylamines are hallucinogenic drugs like the 2C series of psychedelic substituted phenethylamines. The further banning of tyramine's optical isomers, positional isomers, or geometric isomers, and salts of isomers where they exist, means that meta-tyramine and phenylethanolamine, a substance found in every living human body, and other common, non-hallucinogenic substances are also illegal to buy, sell, or possess in Florida. Given that tyramine occurs naturally in many foods and drinks (most commonly as a by-product of bacterial fermentation), e.g. wine, cheese, and chocolate, Florida's total ban on the substance may prove difficult to enforce. == Notes == == References =="	Tyramine	WIKIPEDIA	('ENDOGENOUS, FOOD', [('END', -0.07973595708608627), ('OG', -1.9361264946837764e-07), ('ENO', -2.339278580620885e-06), ('US', 0.0), (',', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (' FOOD', -2.1008713702030946e-06)])

67952.0	('Octadeca-9,12-diynoic acid', 'Ro 3-1314', 'Odya', 'Ro-3-1314')	mouse	 During the irreversible inactivation of soybean Fe(III)-lipoxygenase [Fe(III)-LOX] by octadeca-9,12-diynoic acid (ODYA), significant quantities of 11-oxooctadeca-9,12 diynoic acid (11-oxo-ODYA) are formed [Nieuwenhuizen, W. F., et al. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 10538-10545]. To elucidate the inactivation mechanism, a quantitative study into the relationship between the inactivation and 11-oxo-ODYA formation was carried out. The following observations were made (1) LOX (0.84 microM) was completely inactivated by 10 to 80 microM ODYA. However, at ODYA concentrations greater than 100 microM, LOX was only partially inactivated, and there was no inactivation at all at ODYA concentrations above 750 microM. The average number of turnovers in which 11-oxo-ODYA was formed increased from 1.2 to 12 when the ODYA concentration increased from 1 to 50 microM and then decreased again to 1.2 at 1000 microM ODYA. (2) The enzyme that was not irreversibly inactivated by ODYA was in the Fe(III) form at ODYA concentrations below 10 microM but in the Fe(II) form at ODYA concentrations greater than 100 microM. (3) In the presence of 750 microM ODYA and 25 microM 13(S)-hydroperoxy-9Z,11E-octadecadienoic acid, all of the enzyme was inactivated. On the basis of these results, it is proposed that the dioxygenation product of ODYA is 11-hydroperoxyoctadeca-9,12-diynoic acid (11-HP-ODYA), which can convert Fe(II)-LOX into its Fe(III) form. However 11-HP-ODYA is converted into 11-oxo-ODYA, which cannot perform the oxidation. It is proposed that the inactivating agent is either 11-HP-ODYA or the 11-peroxy-octadeca-9,12-diynoic acid radical (11-peroxy-ODYA radical), formed from the ODYA radical and O2. The oxidation of Fe(II)-LOX into its Fe(III) form as well as the inactivation of Fe(III)-LOX is competitively inhibited by ODYA Triple bond analogues of polyunsaturated fatty acids irreversibly inactivate lipoxygenases. During the inactivation the inhibitors are converted enzymatically [Kühn, H., et al. (1984) Eur. J. Biochem. 139, 577-583]. Since the converted inhibitor molecules may hold important information about the inactivation mechanism, we have determined the structure of the product that is formed during the irreversible inactivation of soybean lipoxygenase-1 by octadeca-9,12-diynoic acid (ODYA), the triple bond analogue of linoleic acid. This product is formed only in the presence of Fe(III)-lipoxygenase-1 and O2. It was purified by C18 solid phase extraction and reversed phase HPLC and was identified with UV, IR, and NMR spectroscopic and mass spectrometric techniques as the novel lipoxygenase product, 11-oxooctadeca-9,12-diynoic acid (11-oxo-ODYA). It is estimated that each lipoxygenase molecule produces 8-10 11-oxo-ODYA molecules before it is inactivated. Furthermore, we have shown that in a secondary reaction 3-4 molecules of 11-oxo-ODYA are covalently attached per lipoxygenase molecule, most likely, to solvent-exposed amino groups. This leads to the formation of a N-penten-4-yn-3-one chromophore, RC(NHX)=CHC(O)C=CR1, in which X stands for the protein and R or R1 for CH3(CH2)4- or -(CH2)7COOH, respectively. Fe(II)- and Fe(III)-lipoxygenase remain active upon reaction with purified 11-oxo-ODYA. It is concluded that (a) several enzymatic turnovers are required for the complete inactivation of lipoxygenase by ODYA and (b) covalent attachment of 11-oxo-ODYA occurs outside the active site and is not the cause of the inactivation.

Bile acid synthesis is under negative feedback control through activation of the nuclear receptor farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in the ileum and liver. Here we profiled the bile acid composition throughout the enterohepatic system in germ-free (GF) and conventionally raised (CONV-R) mice. We confirmed a dramatic reduction in muricholic acid, but not cholic acid, levels in CONV-R mice. Rederivation of Fxr-deficient mice as GF demonstrated that the gut microbiota regulated expression of fibroblast growth factor 15 in the ileum and cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) in the liver by FXR-dependent mechanisms. Importantly, we identified tauro-conjugated beta- and alpha-muricholic acids as FXR antagonists. These studies suggest that the gut microbiota not only regulates secondary bile acid metabolism but also inhibits bile acid synthesis in the liver by alleviating FXR inhibition in the ileum. β-Muricholic acid (βMCA) is a trihydroxylated bile acid that constitutes the major bile acid in rat and mouse. βMCA is more hydrophilic than ursodeoxycholic acid and has been evaluated for dissolution of cholesterol gallstones. Since it is unknown if βMCA has beneficial effects on hepatocyte cell death we determined the effect of tauro-βMCA (TβMCA) on apoptosis in vitro. Human Ntcp-transfected HepG2 cells and primary hepatocytes from rat and mouse were incubated with the proapoptotic glycochenodeoxycholic acid (GCDCA) as well as the free fatty acid palmitate in the absence and presence of TβMCA. Apoptosis was quantified using caspase 3/7-assays and after Hoechst 33342 staining. The mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was measured fluorometrically using JC-1 (5,5',6,6'-tetrachloro-1,1',3,3'-tetraethyl-benzimidazol-carbocyaniniodide). Immunoblotting was performed against the proapoptotic Bcl-2-protein Bax. In Ntcp-HepG2 cells, GCDCA markedly increased apoptosis after 4h. Co-incubation with TβMCA reduced apoptosis to 49% (p<0.01 vs. GCDCA, each; n=6). While GCDCA (100μmol/L) reduced the MMP to 34% after 6h, combination treatment with TβMCA restored the MMP to control levels at all time points (n=4). TβMCA also restored breakdown of the MMP induced by palmitate. GCDCA induced a translocation of Bax from the cytosol to mitochondria that was inhibited by simultaneous treatment with TβMCA in eqimolar concentrations. TβMCA restricts hepatocellular apoptosis induced by low micromolar concentrations of GCDCA or palmitate via inhibition of Bax translocation to mitochondria and preservation of the MMP. Thus, further studies are warranted to evaluate a potential use of TβMCA in ameliorating liver injury in cholestasis. Polygoni Multiflori Radix (PMR) has been widely used as a tonic for centuries. However, hepatotoxicity cases linked to PMR have been frequently reported and appropriate biomarkers for clinical diagnosis are currently lacking. Here, an approach using UPLC-QqQ/MS-based targeted metabolomics of bile acids (BAs) complemented with biochemistry and histopathology was applied to characterize the development and recovery processes of PMR-induced hepatotoxicity in rats and to identify biomarkers. The expression of bile salt export pump (Bsep) and sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (Ntcp) were evaluated to investigate the underlying mechanism. Steatosis and inflammatory cell infiltration were observed in PMR-treated rats, which were accompanied by the elevation of serum biochemistry. The metabolic profiles of BAs were analyzed by Principal Component Analysis, hyodeoxycholic acid (HDCA) in serum and tauro-β-muricholic acid (TβMCA) in urine were identified as potential biomarkers for PMR-induced hepatotoxicity. The elevated expression of Bsep and decreased expression of Ntcp in the liver of PMRtreated rats indicated that hepatotoxicity was related to the disorders of BAs metabolism. Our study demonstrated that BAs may be used for clinical diagnosis of PMR-induced hepatotoxicity. Urine TβMCA was identified as a promising biomarker to facilitate the clinical monitoring of PMR-induced hepatotoxicity and may serve as potential therapeutic target.

Characterisation of the high affinity site under optimal conditions demonstrated an equilibrium dissociation constant (KD) of approximately 9nM and maximum binding capacity of approximately 120 fmols/mg protein. Kinetic analysis of [3H]-His-Pro binding is limited by low binding density, instability of the high affinity site and rapid degradation of the radioligand. The thiol blocking reagent pHydroxymercuriphenylsulphonic acid (HMPS) inhibited [3H]-His-Pro degradation but also reduced binding of the peptide to membranes. The results are discussed with reference to the lack of specific binding sites in brain for the proposed neuropeptide and TRH metabolite cyclo(His-Pro). Histidyl-proline diketopiperazine [cyclo(His-Pro)] is a metabolite of thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH). This review summarizes the literature concerning cyclo (His-Pro) and, in addition, some studies dealing with TRH and other peptide that are considered of interest. The enzymes concerned with the metabolism of TRH are discussed. Distribution studies of peptides by immunological methods show that, while TRH is concentrated in synaptosomes, cyclo (His-Pro) is not, suggesting that cyclo (His-Pro) is not a classical neurotransmitter. Rat brain contains approximately three times as much cyclo (His-Pro) as TRH, mainly localized in the pituitary and hypothalamus. While the TRH is found in a free form, the cyclo (His-Pro) is bound to a carrier of molecular weight approximately 70,000. While specific membrane receptors for TRH have been detected in pituitary cells, no such receptors for cyclo (His-Pro) have yet been found in brain or pituitary; however, there is a specific binding of cyclo (His-Pro) to adrenal cortex membranes. Both TRH and cyclo (His-Pro) have effects in the central nervous system or pituitary.

New compounds were obtained from the (+)-camphor derivative (+)-ketopinic acid. The chemical library was tested in vitro for cytotoxicity against the MDCK cell line and for antiviral activity against influenza viruses of H1N1 and H7N9 subtypes. The synthesised compounds exhibited high virus-inhibiting activity against the H1N1 influenza virus. Some synthesised compounds were also active against the influenza virus of a different antigenic subtype: H7N9. The mechanism of the virus-inhibiting activity of these compounds is based on their interference with the fusion activity of viral hemagglutinin (HA). No interference with the receptor-binding activity of HA has been demonstrated. According to molecular docking results, the selective antiviral activity of O-acylated amidoximes and 1,2,4-oxadiazoles is associated with their structural features. O-Acylated amidoximes are likely more complementary to the binding site located at the site of the fusion peptide, and 1,2,4-oxadiazoles are more complimentary to the site located at the site of proteolysis. Significant differences in the amino acid residues of the binding sites of HA's of different types allow us to explain the selective antiviral activity of the compounds under study. The hydrogen-bond-assisted self-association process of a chiral semirigid carboxylic acid, namely, (+)-(S)-ketopinic acid, has been studied. The multiconformational monomer/dimer equilibrium has been evaluated by means of a concentration-dependent FTIR study that enabled the experimental equilibrium constants of the dimer formation reaction (Kdim ) to be determined in two solvents of different polarity. In CDCl3 , dimeric forms predominate, even in diluted solutions (KdimCF =5.074), whereas in CD3 CN the self-association process is hindered and monomers are always the main species, irrespective of solute concentration (KdimAN =0.194). The reliability of the dimerization constants and the derived mono- and dimeric experimental fractions have been proven by means of accurate matching between the experimental vibrational circular dichroism spectra of the species and the theoretical spectra generated by considering the simultaneous weighted contributions of the concomitant monomers and dimers.

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is associated with a loss of dopamine-containing neurons in striatum of the brain (1, 2). Dopamine (DA) is synthesized within nerve cells (3). Chemically, L-tyrosine is converted to dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) and then to dopamine in a two-step process. The first, rate limiting step is catalyzed by tyrosine 3-monoxygenase (tyrosine hydroxylase or TH). The second step is catalyzed by aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (L-DOPA decarboxylase, AAAD). In dopaminergic neurons, dopamine is not metabolized further, and is stored in vesicles in the presynaptic nerve terminals. Interstitial dopamine is re-captured by dopamine transporter, DAT. In noradrenergic neurons, dopamine is converted to norepinephrine (NE) by dopamine β-hydroxylase (DBH) and stored in vesicles in the neurons (4). Released NE in synaptic junctions is either inactivated by COMT in postsynaptic cells or transported by a NE transporter (NET) into the nerve terminals (uptake-1). Dopamine is also efficiently transported by NET. At extraneuronal locations, DAT is present in placenta and lung endothelial cells and NET is present in stomach and pancreas.

The presence of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), virus growth, inflammation, and tissue injury increase secretion of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and other cytokines and chemokines. Emigration of leukocytes from the blood is dependent on their ability to roll along endothelial cell surfaces and subsequently adhere to endothelial cell surfaces. Inflammatory mediators and cytokines induce chemokine secretion from endothelial cells and other vascular cells, and they also increase their expression of cell-surface adhesion molecules, such as intracellular adhesion molecule-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, integrins, and selectins. Chemokines are chemotactic toward leukocytes and toward sites of inflammation and tissue injury.

However, an effective biomarker for predicting the prognosis of bevacizumab treatment has yet to be identified. This study, therefore, aimed to retrospectively analyze the polymorphisms of p53 codon 72 and the clinical characteristics of GBM specimens from Taiwanese patients. The polymorphisms of p53 codon 72 in 99 patients with GBM treated at Taichung Veterans General Hospital in Taiwan from 2007 to 2017 were analyzed using direct DNA sequencing and PCR-RFLP analysis. We found that among these GBM patients, the distribution of codon 72 polymorphisms was 28.3% for proline homozygotes (Pro/Pro), 38.4% for arginine homozygotes (Arg/Arg), and 33.3% for proline/arginine heterozygotes (Pro/Arg). Although the polymorphisms of p53 codon 72 were not directly associated with the overall survival of GBM, both the Arg/Arg and Arg/Pro genotypes were associated with significant benefits in terms of overall survival in patients treated with CCRT plus bevacizumab compared to patients treated with CCRT alone. This pilot study suggests that both the Arg/Arg and Arg/Pro genotypes of p53 codon 72 polymorphism may have value as independent prognostic or predictive parameters for bevacizumab treatment response and failure. Relatedly, the results of the study further demonstrate the utility of stratifying GBM patients according to bevacizumab sensitivity.	Pro-arg	PUBMED	('INFO', [('INFO', -3.128163257315464e-07)])
53849.0	('Oxo-taurocholenic acid or isomer  putative',)	mouse	" The Stephan Curve has played a dominant role in caries research over the past several decades. What is so remarkable about the Stephan Curve is the plethora of interactions it illustrates and yet acid production remains the dominant focus. Using sophisticated technology, it is possible to measure pH changes in plaque; however, these observations may carry a false sense of accuracy. Recent observations have shown that there may be multiple pH values within the plaque matrix, thus emphasizing the importance of the milieu within which acid is formed. Although acid production is indeed the immediate proximate cause of tooth dissolution, the influence of alkali production within plaque has received relative scant attention. Excessive reliance on Stephan Curve leads to describing foods as ""safe"" if they do not lower the pH below the so-called ""critical pH"" at which point it is postulated enamel dissolves. Acid production is just one of many biological processes that occur within plaque when exposed to sugar. Exploration of methods to enhance alkali production could produce rich research dividends. Acid-resistant bacteria are more and more widely used in industrial production due to their unique acid-resistant properties. In order to survive in various acidic environments, acid-resistant bacteria have developed diverse protective mechanisms such as sensing acid stress and signal transduction, maintaining intracellular pH homeostasis by controlling the flow of H Diet can affect the body's acid-base balance due to its content of acid or base precursors. There is conflicting evidence for the role of metabolic acidosis in the development of cardiometabolic disorders, hypertension (HT), and insulin resistance (IR). We hypothesized that dietary acid load (DAL) is associated with adverse metabolic risk factors and aimed to investigate this in the elderly. A total of 114 elderly participants were included in the study. The participants were divided into four groups, such as HT, diabetes (DM), both HT and DM, and healthy controls. Anthropometric, biochemical, and clinical findings were recorded. Potential renal acid load (PRAL) and net endogenous acid production (NEAP) results were obtained for three days, 24-hour dietary records via a nutrient database program (BeBiS software program). The groups were matched for age, gender, and BMI. There was a statistically significant difference between the groups regarding NEAP (p =0.01) and no significant difference for PRAL ( p = 0.086). The lowest NEAP and PRAL levels were seen in the control group while the highest in the HT group. Both NEAP and PRAL were correlated with waist circumference (r = 0,325, p = 0.001; r=0,231, p =0,016, respectively). Our data confirmed that subjects with HT and DM had diets with greater acid-forming potential. High NEAP may be a risk factor for chronic metabolic diseases, particularly HT. PRAL could not be shown as a significantly different marker in all participants. Dietary content has a significant contribution to the reduction of cardiovascular risk factors, such as HT, DM, and obesity."

68924.0	('Spermidine-c20:4',)	mouse	 Folic acid (FA; also known as folate or vitamin B One of the mechanisms that tumor cells use to escape the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents, such as Adriamycin, Vinca alkaloids, epipodophyllotoxins, actinomycin D, and paclitaxel (PAC), is to limit their presence inside the cells through the actions of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a protein encoded by the multidrug resistance (MDR-1) gene (1, 2). P-gp is an ATP-dependent transmembrane multidrug transporter that is capable of actively pumping a variety of agents out of cells. Injection of unlabeled efflux pump substrates increases the retention of radioactivity in tumors rather than lessening the retention, as seen with receptor-binding radiotracers. Overexpression of P-gp in tumor cells (such as renal carcinoma, hepatoma, pheochromocytoma, and colon carcinoma) leads to resistance to anticancer drugs (3). P-gp is also present in a variety of normal cells, such as intestinal mucosal cells, hepatocytes, renal proximal tubule epithelial cells, and endothelial cells of the blood-brain barrier (4, 5). Calcium channel blockers, cyclosporin A, and its non-immunosuppressive analog PSC 833 are MDR modulators that inhibit transport of P-gp substrates out of cells (6, 7).

It is also available in dietary supplements. Indole-3-carbinol is the subject of on-going biomedical research into its possible anticarcinogenic, antioxidant, and anti-atherogenic effects. Research on indole-3-carbinol has been conducted primarily using laboratory animals and cultured cells. Limited and inconclusive human studies have been reported. A recent review of the biomedical research literature found that ""evidence of an inverse association between cruciferous vegetable intake and breast or prostate cancer in humans is limited and inconsistent"" and ""larger randomized controlled trials are needed"" to determine if supplemental indole-3-carbinol has health benefits. == Indole-3-carbinol and cancer == Investigation of mechanisms by which consumption of indole-3-carbinol might influence cancer incidence focuses on its ability to alter estrogen metabolism and other cellular effects. Controlled studies have been performed on such animals as rats, mice, and rainbow trout, introducing various controlled levels of carcinogens, and levels of indole-3-carbinol into their daily diet. Results showed dose-related decreases in tumor susceptibility due to indole-3-carbinol (inferred by decreases in aflatoxin–DNA binding). The first direct evidence of pure anti-initiating activity by a natural anticarcinogen (indole-3-carbinol) found in human diet was claimed by Dashwood et al. in 1989. Indole-3-carbinol induces a G1 growth arrest of human reproductive cancer cells. This is potentially relevant to the prevention and treatment of cancer, as the G1 phase of cell growth occurs early in the cell life cycle, and, for most cells, is the major period of cell cycle during its lifespan. The G1 phase is marked by synthesis of various enzymes that are required in the next (""S"") phase, including those needed for DNA replication. Overuse of indole-3-carbinol supplements in the hope of preventing cancer may be unwise, as the hormone balance should be tested (via simple blood test) before regular consumption. Such caution is advised, due to its effect on estrogen levels (estrogen has a significant impact on brain function). It promotes liver cancer in trout when it is combined with aflatoxin B1 and demotes metastasis. == Melanoma == Indole-3-carbinol causes proliferation arrest and apoptosis in human melanoma cells. Kim et al. (2011) showed that the master regulator of melanoma biology, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF-M) was downregulated by indole-3-carbinol to induce apoptosis. Kundu et al. (2017) demonstrated that the anticancer property of indole-3-carbinol is driven by specific targeting of oncogenic pathways. In two different studies using xenografted mouse model of melanoma, they observed that subcutaneous injection of indole-3-carbinol could bring down tumor burden significantly. The underlying molecular mechanism of this anti-tumor effect was found to be by the specific inhibition of activity of oncogenic BRAFV600E in tumors that harbored the mutation. However, in tumors that expressed wild type BRAF, indole-3-carbinol did not cause any comparable antiproliferative effect. Additionally indole-3-carbinol did not cause antiproliferation even in normal epidermal melanocytes underscoring the specificity and selectivity of its action. Kundu et al. further showed that inhibition of BRAF V600E activity by indole-3-carbinol resulted in downregulation of MITF-M by downstream signaling which caused a G1 cell cycle arrest leading to the observed antiproliferative effect. In a second study Kundu et al. showed that in melanoma cells where PTEN is downregulated, indole-3-carbinol directly interacts with NEDD41 to prevent PTEN ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation. This results in stabilization of PTEN and inhibition of proliferation by downstream AKT signaling. Overall scientific evidence shows that in melanoma, indole-3-carbinol specifically inhibits the two most commonly associated driver mutation signaling pathways to cause proliferation, a fact that can be used to design clinical trial to treat human patients with indole-3-carbinol in future. == Systemic lupus erythematosus == Indole-3-carbinol can shift estrogen metabolism towards less estrogenic metabolites. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE, or lupus), an autoimmune disease, is associated with estrogen. In a study using mice bred to develop lupus, indole-3-carbinol was fed to one group while another group was fed a standard mouse diet; the group fed the indole-3-carbinol diet lived longer and had fewer signs of disease. Another study of lupus-prone mice with indole-3-carbinol defined the mechanism for the improvement of their disease to be due to sequential blocks in the development of B and T cells of these mice. The maturation arrests resulted in a fall in autoantibody production, thought to be a crucial component of lupus causation. In addition, I3C supplementation of the disease prone mice led to a normalization of their T cell function. Women with lupus can manifest a metabolic response to indole-3-carbinol and might also benefit from its antiestrogenic effects. Clinical trials are currently underway to determine the efficacy of treating human patients with lupus using indole-3-carbinol. == Effect in recurrent respiratory papillomatosis == There is evidence suggesting that indole-3-carbinol may have an effect on human papillomavirus-infected cells in both pediatrics and adult patients.

Cinnamomum verum (CV) has anti-inflammatory effects, but the molecular mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects after immunological activation still remain elusive. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of CV in improving depressive-like behavior and explore its underlying mechanism in T lymphocytes. Mice were randomly divided into Control, LPS, LPS plus fluoxetine, LPS plus CV, and LPS plus MCA groups. Behavior was evaluated using forced swimming test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST). The experimental group mice were exposed to LPS to induce depressive-like behavior. Cell viability was measured upon treating splenic T lymphocytes and Jurkat T cells with CV. Cytokine activity was measured using ELISA and RT-qPCR. The components of CV were analyzed by HPLC. NFAT expression was evaluated by western blotting, immunofluorescence, and luciferase assay. To verify the half-life of NFAT mRNA, Jurkat cells were treated with actinomycin D for 1.5, 3, and 4.5 h. CV effectively prevents inflammation-induced depressive-like behaviors. CV dose-dependently decreased protein and mRNA levels of TNFα and IL-2. Inhibition of TNFα and IL-2 production involves an MCA-mediated decrease in NFAT mRNA level, rather than inhibition of nuclear translocation. This mechanism was independent of NFAT transcription inducer p38 MAPK; it can be attributed to the promotion of NFAT mRNA decay. Overall, MCA might be an alternative or adjuvant to existing NFAT-targeting immunosuppressants for clinical prophylaxis or therapy in the context of inflammation-induced depressive disorder or other T-cell-associated inflammatory disorders. The metabolism of o-methoxycinnamaldehyde (1.3 mmol/kg, intragastrically) was studied in rats. Identification of the urinary metabolites by g.l.c.-mass spectrometry and quantification by h.p.l.c. showed that the major metabolic pathway (approx. two-thirds of the dose) was oxidation to the corresponding cinnamic and phenylpropionic acids (C6-C3 acids) which were largely excreted as glycine conjugates. Intermediate amounts (approx. 10% of the dose) of the O-demethylated C6-C3 acids were excreted. Relatively large amounts of the beta-hydroxylated phenylpropionic acid derivative were found, however only traces of the further products of beta-oxidation (2-methoxylated derivatives of benzoic and hippuric acid) were excreted. No evidence was obtained for conjugation of o-methoxycinnamaldehyde with glutathione. Urinary excretion of metabolites was rapid (91% in 24 h and 98% in 48 h). o-Methoxycinnamaldehyde has been isolated and purified from powdered cinnamon. The compound inhibits the growth and toxin production of mycotoxin-producing fungi. The substance completely inhibited the growth of Aspergillus parasiticus and A. flavus at 100 microgram/ml and A. ochraceus and A. versicolor at 200 microgram/ml. It inhibited the production of aflatoxin B1 by over 90% at 6.25 microgram/ml, ochratoxin A at 25 microgram/ml, and sterigmatocystin at 50 microgram/ml. The substance also displayed a strong inhibitory effect on the growth of five dermatophytoses species, e.g., Microsporum canis (minimum inhibitory concentration, 3.12 to 6.25 microgram/ml).

We revealed that culture supernatants of Bacillus subtilis C-3102 (referred to as C-3102) stimulated the growth of Bifidobacterium species. In this study, we isolated and identified six bifidogenic growth factors, which were cyclo (D-Val-D-Ile), cyclo (L-Val-D-Ile), cyclo (D-Val-L-Ile), cyclo (L-Val-L-Ile), cyclo (D-Val-L-Leu) and cyclo (L-Val-L-Leu). These six cyclic dipeptides increased the growth of Bifidobacterium species and had no effect on potentially harmful gut organisms.

29775.0	('Vitamin h', 'Biotin', 'Component of deca-vi-sol', 'Kbiogr_001382', 'Spectrum1503009')	mouse	"Biotin (also known as vitamin B7 or vitamin H) is one of the B vitamins. It is involved in a wide range of metabolic processes, both in humans and in other organisms, primarily related to the utilization of fats, carbohydrates, and amino acids. The name biotin, borrowed from the German Biotin, derives from the Ancient Greek word βίοτος (bíotos; 'life') and the suffix ""-in"" (a suffix used in chemistry usually to indicate 'forming'). Biotin appears as a white, needle-like crystalline solid. == Chemical description == Biotin is classified as a heterocyclic compound, with a sulfur-containing tetrahydrothiophene ring fused to a ureido group. A C5-carboxylic acid side chain is appended to the former ring. The ureido ring, containing the −N−CO−N− group, serves as the carbon dioxide carrier in carboxylation reactions. Biotin is a coenzyme for five carboxylase enzymes, which are involved in the catabolism of amino acids and fatty acids, synthesis of fatty acids, and gluconeogenesis. Biotinylation of histone proteins in nuclear chromatin plays a role in chromatin stability and gene expression. == Dietary recommendations == The US National Academy of Medicine updated Dietary Reference Intakes for many vitamins in 1998. At that time there was insufficient information to establish estimated average requirement or recommended dietary allowance, terms that exist for most vitamins. In instances such as this, the academy sets adequate intakes (AIs) with the understanding that at some later date, when the physiological effects of biotin are better understood, AIs will be replaced by more exact information. The biotin AIs for both males and females are: Australia and New Zealand set AIs similar to the US. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) also identifies AIs, setting values at 40 μg/day for adults, pregnancy at 40 μg/day, and breastfeeding at 45 μg/day. For children ages 1–17 years, the AIs increase with age from 20 to 35 μg/day. === Safety === The US National Academy of Medicine estimates upper limits for vitamins and minerals when evidence for a true limit is sufficient. For biotin, however, there is no upper limit because the adverse effects of high biotin intake have not been determined. The EFSA also reviewed safety and reached the same conclusion as in the United States. === Labeling regulations === For US food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of daily value. For biotin labeling purposes, 100% of the daily value was 300 μg/day, but as of May 27, 2016, it was revised to 30 μg/day to agree with the adequate intake. Compliance with the updated labeling regulations was required by January 1, 2020, for manufacturers with US$10 million or more in annual food sales, and by January 1, 2021, for manufacturers with lower volume food sales. A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at Reference Daily Intake. == Sources == Biotin is stable at room temperature and is not destroyed by cooking. The dietary biotin intake in Western populations has been estimated to be in the range of 35 to 70 μg/day. Nursing infants ingest about 6 μg/day. Biotin is available in dietary supplements, individually or as an ingredient in multivitamins. According to the Global Fortification Data Exchange, biotin deficiency is so rare that no countries require that foods be fortified. == Physiology == Biotin is a water-soluble B vitamin. Consumption of large amounts as a dietary supplement results in absorption, followed by excretion into urine as biotin. Consumption of biotin as part of a normal diet results in urinary excretion of biotin and biotin metabolites. === Absorption === Biotin in food is bound to proteins. Digestive enzymes reduce the proteins to biotin-bound peptides. The intestinal enzyme biotinidase, found in pancreatic secretions and in the brush border membranes of all three parts of the small intestine, frees biotin, which is then absorbed from the small intestine. When consumed as a biotin dietary supplement, absorption is nonsaturable, meaning that even very high amounts are absorbed effectively. Transport across the jejunum is faster than across the ileum. The large intestine microbiota synthesizes amounts of biotin estimated to be similar to the amount taken in the diet, and a significant portion of this biotin exists in the free (protein-unbound) form and, thus, is available for absorption. How much is absorbed in humans is unknown, although a review did report that human colon epithelial cells in vitro demonstrated an ability to uptake biotin. Once absorbed, sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT) mediates biotin uptake into the liver. SMVT also binds pantothenic acid, so high intakes of either of these vitamins can interfere with the transport of the other. === Metabolism and excretion === Biotin catabolism occurs via two pathways. In one, the valeric acid sidechain is cleaved, resulting in bisnorbiotin. In the other path, the sulfur is oxidized, resulting in biotin sulfoxide. Urine content is proportionally about half biotin, plus bisnorbiotin, biotin sulfoxide, and small amounts of other metabolites. === Factors that affect biotin requirements === Chronic alcohol use is associated with a significant reduction in plasma biotin. Intestinal biotin uptake also appears to be sensitive to the effect of the anti-epilepsy drugs carbamazepine and primidone. Relatively low levels of biotin have also been reported in the urine or plasma of patients who have had a partial gastrectomy or have other causes of achlorhydria, as well as burn patients, elderly individuals, and athletes. Pregnancy and lactation may be associated with an increased demand for biotin. In pregnancy, this may be due to a possible acceleration of biotin catabolism, whereas, in lactation, the higher demand has yet to be elucidated. Recent studies have shown marginal biotin deficiency can be present in human gestation, as evidenced by increased urinary excretion of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, decreased urinary excretion of biotin and bisnorbiotin, and decreased plasma concentration of biotin. == Biosynthesis == Biotin, synthesized in plants, is essential to plant growth and development. Bacteria also synthesize biotin, and it is thought that bacteria resident in the large intestine may synthesize biotin that is absorbed and utilized by the host organism. Biosynthesis starts from two precursors, alanine and pimeloyl-CoA. These form 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid (KAPA). KAPA is transported from plant peroxisomes to mitochondria where it is converted to 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid (DAPA) with the help of the enzyme, BioA. The enzyme dethiobiotin synthetase catalyzes the formation of the ureido ring via a DAPA carbamate activated with ATP, creating dethiobiotin with the help of the enzyme, BioD, which is then converted into biotin which is catalyzed by BioB. The last step is catalyzed by biotin synthase, a radical SAM enzyme. The sulfur is donated by an unusual [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin. Depending on the species of bacteria, Biotin can be synthesized via multiple pathways. == Cofactor biochemistry == The enzyme holocarboxylase synthetase covalently attaches biotin to five human carboxylase enzymes: Acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACC1) Acetyl-CoA carboxylase beta (ACC2) Pyruvate carboxylase (PC) Methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC) Propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) For the first two, biotin serves as a cofactor responsible for the transfer of bicarbonate to acetyl-CoA, converting it to malonyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis. PC participates in gluconeogenesis. MCC catalyzes a step in leucine metabolism. PCC catalyzes a step in the metabolism of propionyl-CoA. Metabolic degradation of the biotinylated carboxylases leads to the formation of biocytin. This compound is further degraded by biotinidase to release biotin, which is then reutilized by holocarboxylase synthetase. Biotinylation of histone proteins in nuclear chromatin is a posttranslational modification that plays a role in chromatin stability and gene expression. == Deficiency == Primary biotin deficiency, meaning deficiency due to too little biotin in the diet, is rare because biotin is contained in many foods. Subclinical deficiency can cause mild symptoms, such as hair thinning, brittle fingernails, or skin rash, typically on the face. Aside from inadequate dietary intake (rare), biotin deficiency can be caused by a genetic disorder that affects biotin metabolism. The most common among these is biotinidase deficiency. Low activity of this enzyme causes a failure to recycle biotin from biocytin. Rarer are carboxylase and biotin transporter deficiencies. Neonatal screening for biotinidase deficiency started in the United States in 1984, with many countries now also testing for this genetic disorder at birth. Treatment is a lifelong dietary supplement with biotin. If biotinidase deficiency goes untreated, it can be fatal. === Diagnosis === Low serum and urine biotin are not sensitive indicators of inadequate biotin intake. However, serum testing can be useful for confirmation of consumption of biotin-containing dietary supplements, and whether a period of refraining from supplement use is long enough to eliminate the potential for interfering with drug tests. Indirect measures depend on the biotin requirement for carboxylases. 3-Methylcrotonyl-CoA is an intermediate step in the catabolism of the amino acid leucine. Without biotin, the pathway diverts to 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid. Urinary excretion of this compound is an early and sensitive indicator of biotin deficiency. === Deficiency as a result of metabolic disorders === Biotinidase deficiency is a deficiency of the enzyme that recycles biotin, due to an inherited genetic mutation. Biotinidase catalyzes the cleavage of biotin from biocytin and biotinyl-peptides (the proteolytic degradation products of each holocarboxylase) and thereby recycles biotin. It is also important in freeing biotin from dietary protein-bound biotin. Neonatal screening for biotinidase deficiency started in the United States in 1984, which as of 2017 was reported as required in more than 30 countries. Profound biotinidase deficiency, defined as less than 10% of normal serum enzyme activity, which has been reported as 7.1 nmol/min/mL, has an incidence of 1 in 40,000 to 1 in 60,000, but with rates as high as 1 in 10,000 in countries with high incidence of consanguineous marriages (second cousin or closer). Partial biotinidase deficiency is defined as 10% to 30% of normal serum activity. Incidence data stems from government-mandated newborn screening. For profound deficiency, treatment is oral dosing with 5 to 20 mg per day. Seizures are reported as resolving in hours to days, with other symptoms resolving within weeks. Treatment of partial biotinidase deficiency is also recommended even though some untreated people never manifest symptoms. Lifelong treatment with supplemental biotin is recommended for both profound and partial biotinidase deficiency. Inherited metabolic disorders characterized by deficient activities of biotin-dependent carboxylases are termed multiple carboxylase deficiency. These include deficiencies in the enzymes holocarboxylase synthetase. Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency prevents the body's cells from using biotin effectively and thus interferes with multiple carboxylase reactions. There can also be a genetic defect affecting the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter protein. Biochemical and clinical manifestations of any of these metabolic disorders can include ketolactic acidosis, organic aciduria, hyperammonemia, rash, hypotonia, seizures, developmental delay, alopecia and coma. == Use in biotechnology == Chemically modified versions of biotin are widely used throughout the biotechnology industry to isolate proteins and non-protein compounds for biochemical assays. Because egg-derived avidin binds strongly to biotin with a dissociation constant Kd ≈ 10−15 M, biotinylated compounds of interest can be isolated from a sample by exploiting this highly stable interaction. First, the chemically modified biotin reagents are bound to the targeted compounds in a solution via a process called biotinylation. The choice of which chemical modification to use is responsible for the biotin reagent binding to a specific protein. Second, the sample is incubated with avidin bound to beads, then rinsed, removing all unbound proteins, while leaving only the biotinylated protein bound to avidin. Last, the biotinylated protein can be eluted from the beads with excess free biotin. The process can also utilize bacteria-derived streptavidin bound to beads, but because it has a higher dissociation constant than avidin, very harsh conditions are needed to elute the biotinylated protein from the beads, which often will denature the protein of interest. == Interference with medical laboratory results == When people are ingesting high levels of biotin in dietary supplements, a consequence can be clinically significant interference with diagnostic blood tests that use biotin-streptavidin technology. This methodology is commonly used to measure levels of hormones such as thyroid hormones, and other analytes such as 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Biotin interference can produce both falsely normal and falsely abnormal results. In the US, biotin as a non-prescription dietary supplement is sold in amounts of 1 to 10 mg per serving, with claims for supporting hair and nail health, and as 300 mg per day as a possibly effective treatment for multiple sclerosis (see § Research). Overconsumption of 5 mg/day or higher causes elevated concentration in plasma that interferes with biotin-streptavidin immunoassays in an unpredictable manner. Healthcare professionals are advised to instruct patients to stop taking biotin supplements for 48 h or even up to weeks before the test, depending on the specific test, dose, and frequency of biotin uptake. Guidance for laboratory staff is proposed to detect and manage biotin interference. == History == In 1916, W. G. Bateman observed that a diet high in raw egg whites caused toxic symptoms in dogs, cats, rabbits, and humans. By 1927, scientists such as Margarete Boas and Helen Parsons had performed experiments demonstrating the symptoms associated with ""egg-white injury."" They had found that rats fed large amounts of egg whites as their only protein source exhibited neurological dysfunction, hair loss, dermatitis, and eventually, death. In 1936, Fritz Kögl and Benno Tönnis documented isolating a yeast growth factor in a journal article titled ""Darstellung von krystallisiertem biotin aus eigelb."" (Representation of crystallized biotin from egg yolk). The name biotin derives from the Greek word bios ('to live') and the suffix ""-in"" (a general chemical suffix used in organic chemistry). Other research groups, working independently, had isolated the same compound under different names. Hungarian scientist Paul Gyorgy began investigating the factor responsible for egg-white injury in 1933 and in 1939, was successful in identifying what he called ""Vitamin H"" (the H represents Haar und Haut, German for 'hair and skin'). Further chemical characterization of vitamin H revealed that it was water-soluble and present in high amounts in the liver. After experiments performed with yeast and Rhizobium trifolii, West and Wilson isolated a compound they called co-enzyme R. By 1940, it was recognized that all three compounds were identical and were collectively given the name: biotin. Gyorgy continued his work on biotin and in 1941 published a paper demonstrating that egg-white injury was caused by the binding of biotin by avidin. Unlike for many vitamins, there is insufficient information to establish a recommended dietary allowance, so dietary guidelines identify an ""adequate intake"" based on best available science with the understanding that at some later date this will be replaced by more exact information. Using E. coli, a biosynthesis pathway was proposed by Rolfe and Eisenberg in 1968. The initial step was described as a condensation of pimelyl-CoA and alanine to form 7-oxo-8-aminopelargonic acid. From there, they described a three-step process, the last being introducing a sulfur atom to form the tetrahydrothiophene ring. == Research == === Multiple sclerosis === High-dose biotin (300 mg/day = 10,000 times adequate intake) has been used in clinical trials for treatment of multiple sclerosis, a demyelinating autoimmune disease. The hypothesis is that biotin may promote remyelination of the myelin sheath of nerve cells, slowing or even reversing neurodegeneration. The proposed mechanisms are that biotin activates acetyl-CoA carboxylase, a key rate-limiting enzyme during the synthesis of myelin, and by reducing axonal hypoxia through enhanced energy production. Clinical trial results are mixed; a 2019 review concluded that a further investigation of the association between multiple sclerosis symptoms and biotin should be undertaken, whereas two 2020 reviews of a larger number of clinical trials reported no consistent evidence for benefits, and some evidence for increased disease activity and higher risk of relapse. === Hair, nails, skin === In the United States, biotin is promoted as a dietary supplement for strengthening hair and fingernails, though scientific data supporting these outcomes in humans are very weak. A review of the fingernails literature reported brittle nail improvement as evidence from two pre-1990 clinical trials that had administered an oral dietary supplement of 2.5 mg/day for several months, without a placebo control comparison group. There is no more recent clinical trial literature. A review of biotin as a treatment for hair loss identified case studies of infants and young children with genetic defect biotin deficiency having improved hair growth after supplementation, but went on to report that ""there have been no randomized, controlled trials to prove the efficacy of supplementation with biotin in normal, healthy individuals."" Biotin is also incorporated into topical hair and skin products with similar claims. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 states that the US Food and Drug Administration must allow on the product label what are described as ""Structure:Function"" (S:F) health claims that ingredient(s) are essential for health. For example: Biotin helps maintain healthy skin, hair, and nails. If a S:F claim is made, the label must include the disclaimer ""This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease."" == Animals == In cattle, biotin is necessary for hoof health. Lameness due to hoof problems is common, with herd prevalence estimated at 10 to 35%. Consequences of lameness include less food consumption, lower milk production, and increased veterinary treatment costs. Results after 4–6 months from supplementing biotin at 20 mg/day into daily diet reduces the risk of lameness. A review of controlled trials reported that supplementation at 20 mg/day increased milk yield by 4.8%. The discussion speculated that this could be an indirect consequence of improved hoof health or a direct effect on milk production. For horses, conditions such as chronic laminitis, cracked hooves, or dry, brittle feet incapable of holding shoes are a common problem. Biotin is a popular nutritional supplement. There are recommendations that horses need 15 to 25 mg/day. Studies report biotin improves the growth of new hoof horn rather than improving the status of existing hoof, so months of supplementation are needed for the hoof wall to be completely replaced. == See also == Biotin deficiency Biotin sulfoxide Biotinidase deficiency Biotinylation Multiple carboxylase deficiency NeutrAvidin Photobiotin == References == == External links == Media related to Biotin at Wikimedia Commons"	Biotin	WIKIPEDIA	('FOOD, PERSONAL CARE', [('FO', -0.06670854240655899), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -0.47414630651474), (' PERSONAL', -0.009374117478728294), (' CARE', 0.0)])
119930.0	('Beta-carotene', 'Beta carotene', 'Beta,beta-carotene', 'Solatene', 'Betacarotene')	mouse	"β-Carotene (beta-carotene) is an organic, strongly colored red-orange pigment abundant in fungi, plants, and fruits. It is a member of the carotenes, which are terpenoids (isoprenoids), synthesized biochemically from eight isoprene units and thus having 40 carbons. Dietary β-carotene is a provitamin A compound, converting in the body to retinol (vitamin A). In foods, it has rich content in carrots, pumpkin, spinach, and sweet potato. It is used as a dietary supplement and may be prescribed to treat erythropoietic protoporphyria, an inherited condition of sunlight sensitivity. β-carotene is the most common carotenoid in plants. When used as a food coloring, it has the E number E160a.: 119 The structure was deduced in 1930. Isolation of β-carotene from fruits abundant in carotenoids is commonly done using column chromatography. It is industrially extracted from richer sources such as the algae Dunaliella salina. The separation of β-carotene from the mixture of other carotenoids is based on the polarity of a compound. β-Carotene is a non-polar compound, so it is separated with a non-polar solvent such as hexane. Being highly conjugated, it is deeply colored, and as a hydrocarbon lacking functional groups, it is lipophilic. == Provitamin A activity == Plant carotenoids are the primary dietary source of provitamin A worldwide, with β-carotene as the best-known provitamin A carotenoid. Others include α-carotene and β-cryptoxanthin. Carotenoid absorption is restricted to the duodenum of the small intestine. One molecule of β-carotene can be cleaved by the intestinal enzyme β,β-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenase into two molecules of vitamin A. == Absorption, metabolism and excretion == As part of the digestive process, food-sourced carotenoids must be separated from plant cells and incorporated into lipid-containing micelles to be bioaccessible to intestinal enterocytes. If already extracted (or synthetic) and then presented in an oil-filled dietary supplement capsule, there is greater bioavailability compared to that from foods. At the enterocyte cell wall, β-carotene is taken up by the membrane transporter protein scavenger receptor class B, type 1 (SCARB1). Absorbed β-carotene is then either incorporated as such into chylomicrons or first converted to retinal and then retinol, bound to retinol binding protein 2, before being incorporated into chylomicrons. The conversion process consists of one molecule of β-carotene cleaved by the enzyme beta-carotene 15,15'-dioxygenase, which is encoded by the BCO1 gene, into two molecules of retinal. When plasma retinol is in the normal range the gene expression for SCARB1 and BCO1 are suppressed, creating a feedback loop that suppresses β-carotene absorption and conversion. The majority of chylomicrons are taken up by the liver, then secreted into the blood repackaged into low density lipoproteins (LDLs). From these circulating lipoproteins and the chylomicrons that bypassed the liver, β-carotene is taken into cells via receptor SCARB1. Human tissues differ in expression of SCARB1, and hence β-carotene content. Examples expressed as ng/g, wet weight: liver=479, lung=226, prostate=163 and skin=26. Once taken up by peripheral tissue cells, the major usage of absorbed β-carotene is as a precursor to retinal via symmetric cleavage by the enzyme beta-carotene 15,15'-dioxygenase, which is encoded by the BCO1 gene. A lesser amount is metabolized by the mitochondrial enzyme beta-carotene 9',10'-dioxygenase, which is encoded by the BCO2 gene. The products of this asymmetric cleavage are two beta-ionone molecules and rosafluene. BCO2 appears to be involved in preventing excessive accumulation of carotenoids; a BCO2 defect in chickens results in yellow skin color due to accumulation in subcutaneous fat. == Conversion factors == For counting dietary vitamin A intake, β-carotene may be converted either using the newer retinol activity equivalents (RAE) or the older international unit (IU). === Retinol activity equivalents (RAEs) === Since 2001, the US Institute of Medicine uses retinol activity equivalents (RAE) for their Dietary Reference Intakes, defined as follows: 1 μg RAE = 1 μg retinol from food or supplements 1 μg RAE = 2 μg all-trans-β-carotene from supplements 1 μg RAE = 12 μg of all-trans-β-carotene from food 1 μg RAE = 24 μg α-carotene or β-cryptoxanthin from food RAE takes into account carotenoids' variable absorption and conversion to vitamin A by humans better than and replaces the older retinol equivalent (RE) (1 μg RE = 1 μg retinol, 6 μg β-carotene, or 12 μg α-carotene or β-cryptoxanthin). RE was developed 1967 by the United Nations/World Health Organization Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO/WHO). === International Units === Another older unit of vitamin A activity is the international unit (IU). Like retinol equivalent, the international unit does not take into account carotenoid variable absorption and conversion to vitamin A by humans, as well as the more modern retinol activity equivalent. Food and supplement labels still generally use IU, but IU can be converted to the more useful retinol activity equivalent as follows: 1 μg RAE = 3.33 IU retinol 1 IU retinol = 0.3 μg RAE 1 IU β-carotene from supplements = 0.3 μg RAE 1 IU β-carotene from food = 0.05 μg RAE 1 IU α-carotene or β-cryptoxanthin from food = 0.025 μg RAE1 == Dietary sources == The average daily intake of β-carotene is in the range 2–7 mg, as estimated from a pooled analysis of 500,000 women living in the US, Canada, and some European countries. Beta-carotene is found in many foods and is sold as a dietary supplement. β-Carotene contributes to the orange color of many different fruits and vegetables. Vietnamese gac (Momordica cochinchinensis Spreng.) and crude palm oil are particularly rich sources, as are yellow and orange fruits, such as cantaloupe, mangoes, pumpkin, and papayas, and orange root vegetables such as carrots and sweet potatoes. The color of β-carotene is masked by chlorophyll in green leaf vegetables such as spinach, kale, sweet potato leaves, and sweet gourd leaves. The U.S. Department of Agriculture lists foods high in β-carotene content: === No dietary requirement === Government and non-government organizations have not set a dietary requirement for β-carotene. == Side effects == Excess β-carotene is predominantly stored in the fat tissues of the body. The most common side effect of excessive β-carotene consumption is carotenodermia, a physically harmless condition that presents as a conspicuous orange skin tint arising from deposition of the carotenoid in the outermost layer of the epidermis. === Carotenosis === Carotenoderma, also referred to as carotenemia, is a benign and reversible medical condition where an excess of dietary carotenoids results in orange discoloration of the outermost skin layer. It is associated with a high blood β-carotene value. This can occur after a month or two of consumption of beta-carotene rich foods, such as carrots, carrot juice, tangerine juice, mangos, or in Africa, red palm oil. β-carotene dietary supplements can have the same effect. The discoloration extends to palms and soles of feet, but not to the white of the eye, which helps distinguish the condition from jaundice. Carotenodermia is reversible upon cessation of excessive intake. Consumption of greater than 30 mg/day for a prolonged period has been confirmed as leading to carotenemia. === No risk for hypervitaminosis A === At the enterocyte cell wall, β-carotene is taken up by the membrane transporter protein scavenger receptor class B, type 1 (SCARB1). Absorbed β-carotene is then either incorporated as such into chylomicrons or first converted to retinal and then retinol, bound to retinol binding protein 2, before being incorporated into chylomicrons. The conversion process consists of one molecule of β-carotene cleaved by the enzyme beta-carotene 15,15'-dioxygenase, which is encoded by the BCO1 gene, into two molecules of retinal. When plasma retinol is in the normal range the gene expression for SCARB1 and BCO1 are suppressed, creating a feedback loop that suppresses absorption and conversion. Because of these two mechanisms, high intake will not lead to hypervitaminosis A. === Drug interactions === β-Carotene can interact with medication used for lowering cholesterol. Taking them together can lower the effectiveness of these medications and is considered only a moderate interaction. Bile acid sequestrants and proton-pump inhibitors can decrease absorption of β-carotene. Consuming alcohol with β-carotene can decrease its ability to convert to retinol and could possibly result in hepatotoxicity. Research on animal feeds, suggests that β-Carotene might act as an ""antivitamin D"" that counteracts the availability in forages of vitamin D. === β-Carotene and lung cancer in smokers === Chronic high doses of β-carotene supplementation increases the probability of lung cancer in smokers while its natural vitamer, retinol, increases lung cancer in smokers and nonsmokers. The effect is specific to supplementation dose as no lung damage has been detected in those who are exposed to cigarette smoke and who ingest a physiological dose of β-carotene (6 mg), in contrast to high pharmacological dose (30 mg). Increases in lung cancer have been attributed to the tendency of β-carotene to oxidize, yet based on the pharmacokinetics of β-carotene absorption and transport through the intestine and the lack of specific β-carotene transporters, it is unlikely that β-carotene reaches the lung of smokers in sufficient quantities. Additional research is required to understand the link between the increased risk of cancer and all-cause mortality following β-carotene supplementation. Additionally, supplemental, high-dose β-carotene may increase the risk of prostate cancer, intracerebral hemorrhage, and cardiovascular and total mortality irrespective of smoking status. == Industrial sources == β-carotene is industrially made either by total synthesis (see Retinol § Industrial synthesis) or by extraction from biological sources such as vegetables, microalgae (especially Dunaliella salina), and genetically-engineered microbes. The synthetic path is low-cost and high-yield. == Research == Medical authorities generally recommend obtaining beta-carotene from food rather than dietary supplements. A 2013 meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials concluded that high-dosage (≥9.6 mg/day) beta-carotene supplementation is associated with a 6% increase in the risk of all-cause mortality, while low-dosage (<9.6 mg/day) supplementation does not have a significant effect on mortality. Research is insufficient to determine whether a minimum level of beta-carotene consumption is necessary for human health and to identify what problems might arise from insufficient beta-carotene intake. However, a 2018 meta-analysis mostly of prospective cohort studies found that both dietary and circulating beta-carotene are associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality. The highest circulating beta-carotene category, compared to the lowest, correlated with a 37% reduction in the risk of all-cause mortality, while the highest dietary beta-carotene intake category, compared to the lowest, was linked to an 18% decrease in the risk of all-cause mortality. === Macular degeneration === Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) represents the leading cause of irreversible blindness in elderly people. AMD is an oxidative stress, retinal disease that affects the macula, causing progressive loss of central vision. β-carotene content is confirmed in human retinal pigment epithelium. Reviews reported mixed results for observational studies, with some reporting that diets higher in β-carotene correlated with a decreased risk of AMD whereas other studies reporting no benefits. Reviews reported that for intervention trials using only β-carotene, there was no change to risk of developing AMD. === Cancer === A meta-analysis concluded that supplementation with β-carotene does not appear to decrease the risk of cancer overall, nor specific cancers including: pancreatic, colorectal, prostate, breast, melanoma, or skin cancer generally. High levels of β-carotene may increase the risk of lung cancer in current and former smokers. Results are not clear for thyroid cancer. === Cataract === A Cochrane review looked at supplementation of β-carotene, vitamin C, and vitamin E, independently and combined, on people to examine differences in risk of cataract, cataract extraction, progression of cataract, and slowing the loss of visual acuity. These studies found no evidence of any protective effects afforded by β-carotene supplementation on preventing and slowing age-related cataract. A second meta-analysis compiled data from studies that measured diet-derived serum beta-carotene and reported a not statistically significant 10% decrease in cataract risk. === Erythropoietic protoporphyria === High doses of β-carotene (up to 180 mg per day) may be used as a treatment for erythropoietic protoporphyria, a rare inherited disorder of sunlight sensitivity, without toxic effects. === Food drying === Foods rich in carotenoid dyes show discoloration upon drying. This is due to thermal degradation of carotenoids, possibly via isomerization and oxidation reactions. == See also == Sunless tanning with beta-carotene Vitamin A Retinol Carotenoids == References =="	Beta-carotene	WIKIPEDIA	('FOOD, MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('FO', -0.09124738723039627), ('OD', 0.0), (',', -7.896309739408025e-07), (' MED', -0.3165583312511444), ('ICAL', -1.9361264946837764e-07), (',', -0.000712074339389801), (' INDUSTR', -0.11286255717277527), ('IAL', 0.0)])
3510.0	('Pimelic acid', 'Heptanedioic acid', 'Pileric acid', 'Heptandioic acid', 'Heptane-1,7-dioic acid')	mouse	Pimelic acid is the organic compound with the formula HO2C(CH2)5CO2H. Pimelic acid is one CH2 unit longer than a related dicarboxylic acid, adipic acid, a precursor to many polyesters and polyamides. However compared to adipic acid, pimelic acid is relatively small in importance industrially. Derivatives of pimelic acid are involved in the biosynthesis of the amino acid lysine and the vitamin biotin. == Synthesis == === Biosynthesis === The biosynthesis of pimelic acid is unknown but is speculated to start with malonyl CoA. === Chemical and industrial routes === Like other simple dicarboxylic acids, many methods have been developed for producing pimelic acid. Pimelic acid is produced commercially by oxidation of cycloheptanone with dinitrogen tetroxide. Other routes include the relatively unselective oxidation of palmitic acid and the carbonylation of caprolactone. ==== Niche methods ==== Many other methods exist. Pimelic acid has been synthesized from cyclohexanone and from salicylic acid. In the former route, the additional carbon is supplied by dimethyloxalate, which reacts with the enolate. In other syntheses, pimelic acid is made from cyclohexene-4-carboxylic acid, and a fourth method also exists based on the 1,4 reaction of malonate systems with acrolein. Several patents exist for the production of pimelic acid. == See also == Diaminopimelic acid == References ==	Pimelic acid	WIKIPEDIA	('INDUSTRIAL', [('IND', -0.014178205281496048), ('U', 0.0), ('STR', 0.0), ('IAL', 0.0)])
3199.0	('Allantoin', 'Glyoxyldiureide', 'Cordianine', 'Glyoxyldiureid', 'Allantol')	mouse	"Allantoin is a chemical compound with formula C4H6N4O3. It is also called 5-ureidohydantoin or glyoxyldiureide. It is a diureide of glyoxylic acid. Allantoin is a major metabolic intermediate in most organisms including animals, plants and bacteria, though not humans. It is produced from uric acid, which itself is a degradation product of nucleic acids, by action of urate oxidase (uricase). Allantoin also occurs as a natural mineral compound (IMA symbol Aan). == History == Allantoin was first isolated in 1800 by the Italian physician Michele Francesco Buniva (1761–1834) and the French chemist Louis Nicolas Vauquelin, who mistakenly believed it to be present in the amniotic fluid. In 1821, the French chemist Jean Louis Lassaigne found it in the fluid of the allantois; he called it ""l'acide allantoique"". In 1837, the German chemists Friedrich Wöhler and Justus Liebig synthesized it from uric acid and renamed it ""allantoïn"". == Animals == Named after the allantois (an amniote embryonic excretory organ in which it concentrates during development in most mammals except humans and other hominids), it is a product of oxidation of uric acid by purine catabolism. After birth, it is the predominant means by which nitrogenous waste is excreted in the urine of these animals. In humans and other higher apes, the metabolic pathway for conversion of uric acid to allantoin is not present, so the former is excreted. Recombinant rasburicase is sometimes used as a drug to catalyze this metabolic conversion in patients. In fish, allantoin is broken down further (into ammonia) before excretion. Allantoin has been shown to improve insulin resistance when administered to rats and to increase lifespan when administered to the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans. == Bacteria == In bacteria, purines and their derivatives (such as allantoin) are used as secondary sources of nitrogen under nutrient-limiting conditions. Their degradation yields ammonia, which can then be utilized. For instance, Bacillus subtilis is able to utilize allantoin as its sole nitrogen source. Mutants in the B. subtilis pucI gene were unable to grow on allantoin, indicating that it encodes an allantoin transporter. In Streptomyces coelicolor, allantoinase (EC 3.5.2.5) and allantoicase (EC 3.5.3.4) are essential for allantoin metabolism. In this species the catabolism of allantoin, and the subsequent release of ammonium, inhibits antibiotic production (Streptomyces species synthesize about half of all known antibiotics of microbial origin). == Applications == Allantoin is present in botanical extracts of the comfrey plant and in the urine of most mammals. Chemically synthesized bulk allantoin, which is chemically equivalent to natural allantoin, is safe, non-toxic, compatible with cosmetic raw materials and meets CTFA and JSCI requirements. Over 10,000 patents reference allantoin. === Cosmetics === Manufacturers may use allantoin as an ingredient in over-the-counter cosmetics. === Pharmaceuticals === It is frequently present in toothpaste, mouthwash, and other oral hygiene products, in shampoos, lipsticks, anti-acne products, sun care products, and clarifying lotions, various cosmetic lotions and creams, and other cosmetic and pharmaceutical products. === Biomarker of oxidative stress === Since uric acid is the end product of the purine metabolism in humans, only non-enzymatic processes with reactive oxygen species will give rise to allantoin, which is thus a suitable biomarker to measure oxidative stress in chronic illnesses and senescence. == See also == Imidazolidinyl urea and diazolidinyl urea, are antimicrobial condensation products of allantoin with formaldehyde. == References == == External links == E. coli Allantoinase (AllB) in Uniprot (P77671) GMD MS Spectrum"	Allantoin	WIKIPEDIA	('PERSONAL CARE, MEDICAL, INDUSTRIAL', [('PERSON', -0.1864563375711441), ('AL', 0.0), (' CARE', 0.0), (',', -0.008616226725280285), (' MED', -0.19704604148864746), ('ICAL', 0.0), (',', -0.6935020089149475), (' INDUSTR', -0.6952889561653137), ('IAL', 0.0)])

A sesquiterpene lactone compound (dehydrocostus lactone) isolated from the medicinal plant, Saussurea lappa, inhibited the production of NO in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated RAW 264.7 cells by suppressing inducible nitric oxide synthase enzyme expression. This compound also decreased the TNF-alpha level in LPS-activated systems in vitro and in vivo. Thus, dehydrocostus lactone may be a possible candidate for the development of new drugs to treat endotoxemia accompanied by the overproduction of NO and TNF-alpha. The methanolic extract from the leaves of Laurus nobilis (bay leaf, laurel) was found to inhibit nitric oxide (NO) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated mouse peritoneal macrophages. Through bioassay-guided separation, fourteen known sesquiterpenes were isolated from the active fraction and were examined for ability to inhibit the NO production. Seven sesquiterpene lactones (costunolide, dehydrocostus lactone, eremanthine, zaluzanin C, magnolialide, santamarine and spirafolide) potently inhibited LPS-induced NO production (IC50 = 1.2 approximately 3.8 microM). Other sesquiterpene constituents also showed the inhibitory activity (IC50 > or = 21 microM), but their inhibitory activities were less than those of sesquiterpene lactones. Alpha-methylene-gamma-butyrolactone also showed inhibitory activity (IC50 = 9.6 microM), while mokko lactone and watsonol A etc., reductants of the alpha-methylene-gamma-butyrolactone moiety by NaBH4 or DIBAL, and a 2-mercaptoethanol adduct of dehydrocostus lactone showed little activity (IC50 > or = 18 microM). These results indicated that the alpha-methylene-gamma-butyrolactone moiety is important for the activity. Furthermore, costunolide and dehydrocostus lactone inhibited inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) induction in accordance with induction of heat shock protein 72 (HSP 72). These results suggested that, as one of their mechanisms of action, sesquiterpene lactones induce HSP 72 thereby preventing nuclear factor-kappaB activation followed by iNOS induction. The methanolic extract of the roots of Saussurea lappa CLARKE, a Chinese medicinal herb Saussureae Radix, was found to inhibit nitric oxide (NO) production in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated mouse peritoneal macrophages. Among the constituents from the methanolic extract, two sesquiterpene lactones (costunolide and dehydrocostus lactone) and two amino acid-sesquiterpene conjugates (saussureamines A and B) potently inhibited LPS-induced NO production (IC(50)=1.2-2.8 microM). Saussureamines A and B in addition to costunolide and dehydrocostus lactone did not inhibit iNOS enzyme activity, but they inhibited both induction of inducible NO synthase and activation of nuclear factor-kappaB in accordance with induction of heat shock protein 72.

62759.0	('Prostaglandin bx', 'Postaglandin b1', 'Prostaglandin b1')	mouse	 The effect of Prostaglandin Bx (PGBx) on the development of gastric stress ulceration and bleeding in rats was investigated. The rats were divided into five groups and each rat was injected intravenously with either Saline (control), 0.5 mg, 1 mg, 5 mg, or 25 mg/kg of PGBx, according to group. The rats were then placed in wire conduit cages and placed in a cold room at 4 degrees C for three hours and sacrificed immediately afterwards. Results showed a significant increase in gastric bleeding and ulceration in the groups that received 1 and 5 mg/kg (PGBx) when compared to the control group (p less than 0.01). There was, however, a significant increase in gastric acid output in the group that received 1 mg/kg PGBx when compared to the control group (p less than 0.01). Our results suggest that PGBx, by a mechanism other than the inhibition of gastric acid secretion, maintains the integrity of the gastric mucosa. Median lethal doses were estimated for PGBx administered to mice by the intraperitoneal and intravenous routes. The incidence of lethality (and therefore the LD50) was time dependent over a 96 hour period. The animals were active, were responsive and took nourishment during the 4-day post-injection period so that they apparently died from the direct effects of PGBx (or its metabolites) and not as a consequence of depression-induced dehydration or starvation.

It is common in adolescents and primarily affects sebaceous gland-rich areas. The clinical benefit of the topical acne treatments azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, sulphur, zinc, and alpha-hydroxy acid is unclear. To assess the effects of topical treatments (azelaic acid, salicylic acid, nicotinamide, zinc, alpha-hydroxy acid, and sulphur) for acne. We searched the following databases up to May 2019: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and LILACS. We also searched five trials registers. Clinical randomised controlled trials of the six topical treatments compared with other topical treatments, placebo, or no treatment in people with acne. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. Key outcomes included participants' global self-assessment of acne improvement (PGA), withdrawal for any reason, minor adverse events (assessed as total number of participants who experienced at least one minor adverse event), and quality of life. We included 49 trials (3880 reported participants) set in clinics, hospitals, research centres, and university settings in Europe, Asia, and the USA. The vast majority of participants had mild to moderate acne, were aged between 12 to 30 years (range: 10 to 45 years), and were female. Treatment lasted over eight weeks in 59% of the studies. Study duration ranged from three months to three years. We assessed 26 studies as being at high risk of bias in at least one domain, but most domains were at low or unclear risk of bias. We grouped outcome assessment into short-term (less than or equal to 4 weeks), medium-term (from 5 to 8 weeks), and long-term treatment (more than 8 weeks). The following results were measured at the end of treatment, which was mainly long-term for the PGA outcome and mixed length (medium-term mainly) for minor adverse events. Azelaic acid In terms of treatment response (PGA), azelaic acid is probably less effective than benzoyl peroxide (risk ratio (RR) 0.82, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.72 to 0.95; 1 study, 351 participants), but there is probably little or no difference when comparing azelaic acid to tretinoin (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.14; 1 study, 289 participants) (both moderate-quality evidence). There may be little or no difference in PGA when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.13, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.38; 1 study, 229 participants; low-quality evidence), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). Low-quality evidence indicates there may be no differences in rates of withdrawal for any reason when comparing azelaic acid with benzoyl peroxide (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.29; 1 study, 351 participants), clindamycin (RR 1.30, 95% CI 0.48 to 3.56; 2 studies, 329 participants), or tretinoin (RR 0.66, 95% CI 0.29 to 1.47; 2 studies, 309 participants), but we are uncertain whether there is a difference between azelaic acid and adapalene (1 study, 55 participants; very low-quality evidence). In terms of total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is a difference between azelaic acid compared to adapalene (1 study; 55 participants) or benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 30 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). There may be no difference when comparing azelaic acid to clindamycin (RR 1.50, 95% CI 0.67 to 3.35; 1 study, 100 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the comparison of azelaic acid versus tretinoin, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling. Salicylic acid For PGA, there may be little or no difference between salicylic acid and tretinoin (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09; 1 study, 46 participants; low-quality evidence); we are not certain whether there is a difference between salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (1 study, 86 participants; very low-quality evidence); and PGA was not measured in the comparison of salicylic acid versus benzoyl peroxide. There may be no difference between groups in withdrawals when comparing salicylic acid and pyruvic acid (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.50; 1 study, 86 participants); when salicylic acid was compared to tretinoin, neither group had withdrawals (both based on low-quality evidence (2 studies, 74 participants)). We are uncertain whether there is a difference in withdrawals between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants; very low-quality evidence). For total minor adverse events, we are uncertain if there is any difference between salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide (1 study, 41 participants) or tretinoin (2 studies, 74 participants) (both very low-quality evidence). This outcome was not reported for salicylic acid versus pyruvic acid, but individual application site reactions were reported, such as scaling and redness. Nicotinamide Four studies evaluated nicotinamide against clindamycin or erythromycin, but none measured PGA. Low-quality evidence showed there may be no difference in withdrawals between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.49 to 2.60; 3 studies, 216 participants) or erythromycin (RR 1.40, 95% CI 0.46 to 4.22; 1 study, 158 participants), or in total minor adverse events between nicotinamide and clindamycin (RR 1.20, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.99; 3 studies, 216 participants; low-quality evidence). Total minor adverse events were not reported in the nicotinamide versus erythromycin comparison. Alpha-hydroxy (fruit) acid There may be no difference in PGA when comparing glycolic acid peel to salicylic-mandelic acid peel (RR 1.06, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.26; 1 study, 40 participants; low-quality evidence), and we are uncertain if there is a difference in total minor adverse events due to very low-quality evidence (1 study, 44 participants). Neither group had withdrawals (2 studies, 84 participants; low-quality evidence). Compared to benzoyl peroxide, azelaic acid probably leads to a worse treatment response, measured using PGA. When compared to tretinoin, azelaic acid probably makes little or no difference to treatment response. For other comparisons and outcomes the quality of evidence was low or very low. Risk of bias and imprecision limit our confidence in the evidence. We encourage the comparison of more methodologically robust head-to-head trials against commonly used active drugs. Vitamin C is a water-soluble vitamin, antioxidant, and essential co-factor for collagen biosynthesis, carnitine and catecholamine metabolism, and dietary iron absorption. Humans are unable to synthesize vitamin C, so it is strictly obtained through the dietary intake of fruits and vegetables. Citrus fruits, berries, tomatoes, potatoes, and green leafy vegetables are excellent sources of vitamin C. Although most vitamin C is completely absorbed in the small intestine, the percentage of absorbed vitamin C decreases as intraluminal concentrations increase. Proline residues on procollagen require vitamin C for hydroxylation, making it necessary for the triple-helix formation of mature collagen. The lack of a stable triple-helical structure compromises the integrity of the skin, mucous membranes, blood vessels, and bone. Consequently, a deficiency in vitamin C results in scurvy, which presents with hemorrhage, hyperkeratosis, and hematological abnormalities. This activity outlines the indications, mechanism of action, methods of administration, significant adverse effects, contraindications, and monitoring, of vitamin C so providers can direct patient therapy in treatment or supplementation where it is indicated as part of the interprofessional team. Vitamin B5, also known as pantothenic acid, is a water-soluble nutrient necessary for various metabolic functions within the body. This essential vitamin participates in energy generation, synthesizing hormones, and maintaining optimal conditions for skin, hair, and nails. Supplemental vitamin B5 is employed to address and mitigate nutrient deficiencies. This activity discusses the mechanisms of action, adverse event profile, off-label applications, appropriate dosing strategies, pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, monitoring procedures, and relevant interactions of vitamin B5. Participants gain insights and knowledge essential for managing cases involving nutritional deficiencies and related conditions.
