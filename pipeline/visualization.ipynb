         " Molibresib is a selective, small molecule inhibitor of the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) protein family. This was an open-label, two-part, Phase I/II study investigating molibresib monotherapy for the treatment of hematological malignancies (NCT01943851). Part 1 (dose escalation) determined the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of molibresib in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), or multiple myeloma. Part 2 (dose expansion) investigated the safety and efficacy of molibresib at the RP2D in patients with relapsed/refractory myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; as well as AML evolved from antecedent MDS) or cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). The primary endpoint in Part 1 was safety and the primary endpoint in Part 2 was objective response rate (ORR). There were 111 patients enrolled (87 in Part 1, 24 in Part 2). Molibresib RP2Ds of 75 mg daily (for MDS) and 60 mg daily (for CTCL) were selected. Most common Grade 3+ adverse events included thrombocytopenia (37%), anemia (15%), and febrile neutropenia (15%). Six patients achieved complete responses [3 in Part 1 (2 AML, 1 NHL), 3 in Part 2 (MDS)], and 7 patients achieved partial responses [6 in Part 1 (4 AML, 2 NHL), 1 in Part 2 (MDS)]. The ORRs for Part 1, Part 2, and the total study population were 10% [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.8-18.7], 25% (95% CI, 7.3-52.4), and 13% (95% CI, 6.9-20.6), respectively. While antitumor activity was observed with molibresib, use was limited by gastrointestinal and thrombocytopenia toxicities. Investigations of molibresib as part of combination regimens may be warranted. Molibresib (GSK525762), an orally bioavailable small molecule with 2 major equipotent active metabolites, is being developed for the treatment of cancers. Molibresib is a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). To enable administering safe doses of molibresib to healthy volunteers, this 2-part randomized, open-label, crossover drug-drug interaction trial was conducted as an adaptive design study using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling and simulation to predict the lowest doses of molibresib that could be safely administered alone (10 mg) or with itraconazole and rifampicin (strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A and P-gp, respectively). PBPK simulation guided the molibresib dose (5 mg) to be administered along with itraconazole in part 1. Itraconazole increased total exposure (AUC) of molibresib by 4.15-fold with a 66% increase in C Molibresib (GSK525762) is an investigational, orally bioavailable, small-molecule bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) protein inhibitor for the treatment of advanced solid tumors. Molibresib was initially evaluated in a first-time-in-human (FTIH) study BET115521 consisting of two parts: Part 1 of the study (dose escalation) was conducted in 94 patients with nuclear protein in testis midline carcinoma and other solid tumors, and Part 2 (expansion cohort) was conducted in 99 patients with different solid tumor types. Molibresib is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 enzymes to produce two major active metabolites that are equipotent to the parent molecule. The metabolites are measured together after full conversion of one to the other and reported as an active metabolite composite (GSK3529246). The molibresib pharmacokinetic (PK) profile has been characterized by a decrease in exposure over time, with the decrease more pronounced at higher doses, and accompanied by a slight increase of the metabolite concentrations. Autoinduction of molibresib metabolism was suspected and confirmed in vitro. Here we report the development of a semimechanistic liver-compartment population PK model using PK data from the FTIH study, which adequately describes the autoinduction of molibresib clearance and the PK of both molibresib and GSK3529246. Covariate analysis indicated body weight had a significant effect on the volume of distribution of molibresib and GSK3529246, and higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase resulted in the lower clearance of GSK3529246. This model was used to simulate individual patient exposures based on covariate information for use in future alternative dosing strategies and exposure-response analyses.",

         "Erlotinib, sold under the brand name Tarceva among others, is a medication used to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic cancer. Specifically it is used for NSCLC with mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) — either an exon 19 deletion (del19) or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutation — which has spread to other parts of the body. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include rash, diarrhea, muscle pain, joint pain, and cough. Serious side effects may include lung problems, kidney problems, liver failure, gastrointestinal perforation, stroke, and corneal ulceration. Use in pregnancy may harm the baby. It is a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which acts on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Erlotinib was approved for medical use in the United States in 2004. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == === Lung cancer === Erlotinib in unresectable non-small cell lung cancer when added to chemotherapy improves overall survival by 19%, and improved progression-free survival (PFS) by 29%, when compared to chemotherapy alone. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved erlotinib for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer that has failed at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. In lung cancer, erlotinib has been shown to be effective in patients with or without EGFR mutations, but appears to be more effective in patients with EGFR mutations. Overall survival, progression-free survival and one-year survival are similar to standard second-line therapy (docetaxel or pemetrexed). Overall response rate is about 50% better than standard second-line chemotherapy. Patients who are non-smokers, and light former smokers, with adenocarcinoma or subtypes like BAC are more likely to have EGFR mutations, but mutations can occur in all types of patients. A test for the EGFR mutation has been developed by Genzyme. === Pancreatic cancer === In November 2005, the FDA approved erlotinib in combination with gemcitabine for treatment of locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic pancreatic cancer. === Resistance to treatment === As with other ATP competitive small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib in CML, patients rapidly develop resistance. In the case of erlotinib this typically occurs 8–12 months from the start of treatment. Over 50% of resistance is caused by a mutation in the ATP binding pocket of the EGFR kinase domain involving substitution of a small polar threonine residue with a large nonpolar methionine residue (T790M). Approximately 20% of drug resistance is caused by amplification of the hepatocyte growth factor receptor, which drives ERBB3 dependent activation of PI3K. == Side effects == === Common === Rash occurs in the majority of patients. This resembles acne and primarily involves the face and neck. It is self-limited and resolves in the majority of cases, even with continued use. Some clinical studies have indicated a correlation between the severity of the skin reactions and increased survival though this has not been quantitatively assessed. The Journal of Clinical Oncology reported in 2004 that \"cutaneous [skin] rash seems to be a surrogate marker of clinical benefit, but this finding should be confirmed in ongoing and future studies.\" The newsletter Lung Cancer Frontiers reported in its October 2003 issue, \"Patients with moderate to severe cutaneous reactions [rashes] have a far better survival, than those with only mild reactions and much better than those with no cutaneous manifestations of drug effects.\" Diarrhea Loss of appetite Fatigue Partial hair loss (by strands, not typically in clumps) === Rare === interstitial pneumonitis, which is characterized by cough and increased dyspnea. This may be severe and must be considered among those patients whose breathing acutely worsens. ingrown hairs, such as eyelashes gastrointestinal tract toxicity serious or fatal gastrointestinal tract perforations skin toxicity bullous, blistering, and exfoliative skin conditions (some fatal) Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis ocular disorders corneal lesions Pulmonary toxicity interstitial pneumonitis bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP) pulmonary fibrosis fatal asymmetric interstitial lung disease == Interactions == Erlotinib is not a substrate for either of hepatic OATPs (OATP1B1 or OATP1B3). Also, erlotinib is not an inhibitor of OATP-1B1 or OATP-1B3 transporter. Erlotinib is mainly metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4. Compounds which induce this enzyme (i.e. stimulate its production), such as St John's wort, can lower erlotinib concentrations, while inhibitors can increase concentrations. == Mechanism == Erlotinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor (EGFR inhibitor). The drug follows Iressa (gefitinib), which was the first drug of this type. Erlotinib specifically targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase, which is highly expressed and occasionally mutated in various forms of cancer. It binds in a reversible fashion to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site of the receptor. For the signal to be transmitted, two EGFR molecules need to come together to form a homodimer. These then use the molecule of ATP to trans-phosphorylate each other on tyrosine residues, which generates phosphotyrosine residues, recruiting the phosphotyrosine-binding proteins to EGFR to assemble protein complexes that transduce signal cascades to the nucleus or activate other cellular biochemical processes. When erlotinib binds to EGFR, formation of phosphotyrosine residues in EGFR is not possible and the signal cascades are not initiated. == Society and culture == It is marketed in the United States by Genentech and OSI Pharmaceuticals and elsewhere by Roche. The drug's U.S. patent expired in 2020. In May 2012, the US District Court of Delaware passed an order in favor of OSI Pharmaceutical LLC against Mylan Pharmaceuticals upholding the validity of the patent for Erlotinib. In India, generic pharmaceutical firm Cipla is battling with Roche against the Indian patent for this drug. == References == == External links == \"Erlotinib\". National Cancer Institute.",

         "Butenafine, sold under the brand names Lotrimin Ultra, Mentax, and Butop (In India only), is a synthetic benzylamine derived antifungal drug. It is structurally related to the allylamine antifungals terbinafine & naftifine. == Medical uses == Butenafine is indicated for the topical treatment of tinea (pityriasis) versicolor due to Malassezia furfur, as well as athlete's foot (Tinea pedis), ringworm (Tinea corporis) and jock itch (Tinea cruris) due to Epidermophyton floccosum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton rubrum, and Trichophyton tonsurans. It also displays superior activity against Candida albicans than terbinafine and naftifine. Butenafine demonstrates low minimum inhibitory concentrations against Cryptococcus and Aspergillus. There is some evidence that it is effective against dermatophyte infections of the toenails, but needs to be applied daily for prolonged periods (at least one year). === Available forms === Butenafine is typically available as a 1% topical cream. == Pharmacology == Like the allylamine antifungals (e.g terbinafine), butenafine works by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol by binding to and inhibiting squalene epoxidase, an enzyme in the pathway used for creation of the sterols needed in fungal cell membranes. Lacking ergosterol, the cell membranes increase in permeability, allowing their contents to leak out. Furthermore, inhibition of squalene epoxidase leads to a toxic buildup of squalene. This double action of butenafine (increased membrane permeability and toxic buildup of squalene) makes butenafine fungicidal rather than merely fungistatic. In addition to being an antifungal, butenafine is an anti inflammatory. Because fungal skin infections are often accompanied by significant inflammation, this is a desirable property. The fact that butenafine has intrinsic anti inflammatory properties is also desirable since it is not necessary to add topical glucocorticoids, which often come with undesired side effects. == Chemistry == Butenafine hydrochloride is an odorless white crystalline powder that is freely soluble in methanol, ethanol, and chloroform, yet is only slightly soluble in water. == Synthesis == Reductive amination of 1-naphthaldehyde (1) with methylamine (2) gives the intermediate secondary amine (3). Alkylation of this with p-tert-butyl benzyl bromide (4) yields the tertiary amine butenafine. == References ==",

         "Medical",
         "Bilastine is an antihistamine medication used to treat hives (urticaria), allergic rhinitis and itchy inflamed eyes (allergic conjunctivitis) caused by an allergy. It is a second-generation antihistamine and takes effect by selectively inhibiting the histamine H1 receptor, preventing these allergic reactions. Bilastine has an effectiveness similar to cetirizine, fexofenadine, and desloratadine. Bilastine was discovered by the Spanish firm FAES Farma and received its first approval in the European Union in 2010 for the symptomatic treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and urticaria. It is also approved in Canada and Australia. As of 2023, it remained unapproved for any use in the United States, although Hikma Pharmaceuticals had agreed in 2021 to begin the FDA approval process. Evidence has shown that bilastine is effective in treating skin and eye symptoms of allergic reactions, improving patient's quality of life. Bilastine meets the treatment criteria for allergic rhinitis, as published by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) and the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) initiative. == Medical uses == === Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis === The clinical effectiveness of bilastine in treating allergic rhinitis (AR) and urticaria has been evaluated in 10 clinical trials, involving over 4,600 patients. In each study, bilastine was compared with a placebo and another second-generation antihistamine with established efficacy (active comparator). ==== Allergic rhinitis ==== The studies on SAR were double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group involving male and female patients over 12 year of age with symptomatic disease at the beginning of the study. Nasal symptoms (sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, and congestion) were assessed both before treatment and during treatment period on a daily basis. Non-nasal symptoms (itchy eye, watery eye, itchy ear, and palate) were also assessed according to a 0–3 scale, so that the Total Symptoms Score (TSS) and other related parameters could clearly reflect daily evolution of SAR in each patient and treatment group. Parameters such as quality of life and discomfort were also assessed, and in the same way the type and frequency of AE, tolerability and general safety of treatment were registered. In this SAR studies the daily oral administration during 14 days of bilastine proves to have the same efficacy as the administration of cetirizine and desloratadine. === Urticaria === A review article evaluated data from trials which detailed the efficacy of bilastine in skin models and urticaria to assess whether bilastine has an optimal profile for updosing in urticaria. The authors concluded that bilastine has an excellent profile for both efficacy and safety, although there is a need for controlled clinical trials to compare the efficacy of bilastine in a real-life updosing study in patients with urticaria, paying special attention to itch control. === Dosage and administration === Bilastine comes as a tablet taken by mouth (PO) and it is supposed to be swallowed whole with water. Bilastine should not be given with, or within 1 hour before or 2 hours after, food as it may reduce its effectiveness. Australian dosing guidelines for Allertine give a maximum dose of 20 mg (one tablet) daily as needed (PRN). Dose changes are not required for hepatic or renal impairment. While the onset of its effects vary between formulations, bilastine generally takes effect within 30–60 minutes. It should be taken only by children older than 4 years and adults, or anyone over 12 years for Allertine. == Side effects == Toxicity of bilastine investigated in preclinical toxicology studies in mice, rats and dogs after oral and intravenous administration showed no mortality observed after oral administration of massive doses. After intravenous administration, LD50 (lethal dose for 50% of animals) values were 33 and 45–75 mg/kg in mice and rats, respectively. No signs of toxicity were observed in any organ after bilastine massive overdosing, either orally (in mice, rats and dogs), or intravenously (in rats and dogs) during 4 weeks. No effects on fertility, no teratogenic or mutagenic effects, and no apparent carcinogenic potential were seen in the studies carried out in rats, mice and rabbits. In clinical research, bilastine has proven to be well tolerated, with an adverse events profile similar to that of placebo in healthy volunteers, patients with AR and with chronic idiopathic urticaria. Although the tolerance profile of bilastine and levocetirizine or desloratadine were very similar, bilastine was markedly better tolerated than cetirizine in a clinical assay in SAR, with fewer adverse events in the bilastine group. No anticholinergic adverse events were observed in the clinical trials with bilastine. No serious adverse events were reported during the research and there were no clinically significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiography (ECG) or laboratory tests. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles and studies in special populations indicate that dose adjustment of bilastine is not necessary in elderly patients or in chronic liver disease or chronic kidney disease. === Cardiac safety === The clinical cardiac safety of bilastine has been assessed in many clinical trials performed (more than 3,500 patients treated with bilastine) and in a phase I study (Thorough QT/QTc study) designed according to the ICH E14 guidance and the most demanding requirements from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).When electrocardiograms (ECG) data from all of the phase I studies are analysed, no significant alteration is appreciated in any of the parameters after administering bilastine at single doses (up to 11 times the therapeutic dose), nor at multiple doses (up to 10 times the therapeutic dose). Phase II and III studies on AR and urticaria (including the open-label extension phase of 12 months) do not reveal alterations in the ECG, nor significant prolongations of the QTc interval after administration of bilastine 20 mg. The Thorough QT/QTc study was designed to assess the effect on the QT/QTc interval, both of the therapeutic dose (20 mg) and 100 mg of bilastine, but also the coadministration of the therapeutic dose with usual doses of ketoconazol (400 mg/day), a metabolism inhibitor and a P-gP dependent transport system. It was verified that bilastine 20 and 100 mg administered during 4 days, does not induce significant changes in the QT/QTc interval duration in any of the individuals. Likewise, coadministration of bilastine 20 mg and ketoconazol 400 mg does not produce any significant prolongation of the QT/QTc interval attributable to bilastine. == Interactions == Preclinical data suggest the possibility of interactions between bilastine and drugs or food that are inhibitors or inducers of the P-glycoproteins. Coadministration of bilastine and grapefruit juice (a known P-glycoprotein-mediated drug transport activator) significantly reduced bilastine systemic exposure. This interaction is due to the known effect of grapefruit flavonoids on intestinal transporter systems such as P-glycoproteins and organic anion transporting peptide (OATP). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Bilastine binds to guinea-pig cerebellar histamine H1-receptors (Ki=44 nM) and to human recombinant histamine H1-receptors (Ki=64 nM) with an affinity comparable to that of astemizole and diphenhydramine, and superior than that of cetirizine by three-fold and fexofenadine by five-fold (Corcóstegui). In different murine models, bilastine by oral route, antagonizes the effects of histamine in a dose-dependent manner, with potency similar to that of cetirizine and between 5.5 and 10 times greater than that of fexofenadine. Preclinical investigations demonstrate the affinity and specificity of bilastine for histamine H1-receptors compared with other histamine receptors subtypes and other 30 receptors from different amines. In vivo experimentation confirmed the antihistaminic and antiallergic activity, which was at least comparable to that of other second-generation H1-antihistamines such as cetirizine. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Bilastine is most quickly absorbed with the absence of food, and reaches a mean peak plasma concentration of 220 ng/mL approximately 1 h after both single and multiple dosing. Absorption is reduced by a high-fat breakfast or fruit juice, and the estimated global oral bioavailability is approximately 60%. Bilastine has linear pharmacokinetics in the 2.5–220 mg dose range in healthy adult subjects without evidence of accumulation after 14 days of treatment. ==== Distribution ==== Bilastine distribution has an apparent volume of distribution of 1.29 L/kg, and has an elimination half-life of 14.5 h and plasma protein binding of 84–90%. Bilastine is a peripherally selective drug, and this is thought to be due to limited brain uptake caused by binding to P-glycoprotein. ==== Metabolism ==== Bilastine is not significantly metabolized in humans and is largely eliminated unchanged both in urine and feces – a third and two thirds of the administered dose, respectively, according to a Phase I mass-balance study with radiolabeled bilastine. Bilastine does not readily cross the blood brain barrier and is not metabolized by the liver. Ninety six percent of the administered dose is eliminated within 24 hours. In relation to its antihistamine effect, oral doses of 20 mg daily of bilastine, measured as skin wheal-and-flare surface areas for 24 h, bilastine is capable of inhibiting 50% of the surface areas – throughout the whole administration interval. == Chemistry == Bilastine, or 2-[4-[2-[4-[1-(2-ethoxyethyl) benzimidazol-2-yl] piperidin-1-yl] ethyl] phenyl]-2-methylpropionic acid, is a molecule with a molecular weight of 463.6 daltons and a chemical structure similar to piperidinyl-benzimidazole. Bilastine can be therefore classified into the same chemical group as many of the new antihistamines on the market, although it is not structurally derived, nor is it a metabolite or enantiomer of any of them, but an original molecule designed with the intent of fulfilling all the requirements of a second-generation antihistamine. === Research === Clinical studies using different dosages were done on histamine-induced wheal and flare reaction over a 24-h period, compared with a single 10 mg oral dose of cetirizine. The results of this research indicated that bilastine was at least as efficient as cetirizine in reducing histamine-mediated effects in healthy volunteers. Notably, 20 and 50 mg of bilastine reduced the wheal and flare reaction faster than cetirizine. == References ==",

         "Endogenous, Food, Medical",
         "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, abbreviated NADP or, in older notation, TPN (triphosphopyridine nucleotide), is a cofactor used in anabolic reactions, such as the Calvin cycle and lipid and nucleic acid syntheses, which require NADPH as a reducing agent ('hydrogen source'). NADPH is the reduced form, whereas NADP+ is the oxidized form. NADP+ is used by all forms of cellular life. NADP+ is essential for life because it is needed for cellular respiration. NADP+ differs from NAD+ by the presence of an additional phosphate group on the 2' position of the ribose ring that carries the adenine moiety. This extra phosphate is added by NAD+ kinase and removed by NADP+ phosphatase. == Biosynthesis == === NADP+ === In general, NADP+ is synthesized before NADPH is. Such a reaction usually starts with NAD+ from either the de-novo or the salvage pathway, with NAD+ kinase adding the extra phosphate group. ADP-ribosyl cyclase allows for synthesis from nicotinamide in the salvage pathway, and NADP+ phosphatase can convert NADPH back to NADH to maintain a balance. Some forms of the NAD+ kinase, notably the one in mitochondria, can also accept NADH to turn it directly into NADPH. The prokaryotic pathway is less well understood, but with all the similar proteins the process should work in a similar way. === NADPH === NADPH is produced from NADP+. The major source of NADPH in animals and other non-photosynthetic organisms is the pentose phosphate pathway, by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in the first step. The pentose phosphate pathway also produces pentose, another important part of NAD(P)H, from glucose. Some bacteria also use G6PDH for the Entner–Doudoroff pathway, but NADPH production remains the same. Ferredoxin–NADP+ reductase, present in all domains of life, is a major source of NADPH in photosynthetic organisms including plants and cyanobacteria. It appears in the last step of the electron chain of the light reactions of photosynthesis. It is used as reducing power for the biosynthetic reactions in the Calvin cycle to assimilate carbon dioxide and help turn the carbon dioxide into glucose. It has functions in accepting electrons in other non-photosynthetic pathways as well: it is needed in the reduction of nitrate into ammonia for plant assimilation in nitrogen cycle and in the production of oils. There are several other lesser-known mechanisms of generating NADPH, all of which depend on the presence of mitochondria in eukaryotes. The key enzymes in these carbon-metabolism-related processes are NADP-linked isoforms of malic enzyme, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), and glutamate dehydrogenase. In these reactions, NADP+ acts like NAD+ in other enzymes as an oxidizing agent. The isocitrate dehydrogenase mechanism appears to be the major source of NADPH in fat and possibly also liver cells. These processes are also found in bacteria. Bacteria can also use a NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase for the same purpose. Like the pentose phosphate pathway, these pathways are related to parts of glycolysis. Another carbon metabolism-related pathway involved in the generation of NADPH is the mitochondrial folate cycle, which uses principally serine as a source of one-carbon units to sustain nucleotide synthesis and redox homeostasis in mitochondria. Mitochondrial folate cycle has been recently suggested as the principal contributor to NADPH generation in mitochondria of cancer cells. NADPH can also be generated through pathways unrelated to carbon metabolism. The ferredoxin reductase is such an example. Nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase transfers the hydrogen between NAD(P)H and NAD(P)+, and is found in eukaryotic mitochondria and many bacteria. There are versions that depend on a proton gradient to work and ones that do not. Some anaerobic organisms use NADP+-linked hydrogenase, ripping a hydride from hydrogen gas to produce a proton and NADPH. Like NADH, NADPH is fluorescent. NADPH in aqueous solution excited at the nicotinamide absorbance of ~335 nm (near UV) has a fluorescence emission which peaks at 445-460 nm (violet to blue). NADP+ has no appreciable fluorescence. == Function == NADPH provides the reducing agents, usually hydrogen atoms, for biosynthetic reactions and the oxidation-reduction involved in protecting against the toxicity of reactive oxygen species (ROS), allowing the regeneration of glutathione (GSH). NADPH is also used for anabolic pathways, such as cholesterol synthesis, steroid synthesis, ascorbic acid synthesis, xylitol synthesis, cytosolic fatty acid synthesis and microsomal fatty acid chain elongation. The NADPH system is also responsible for generating free radicals in immune cells by NADPH oxidase. These radicals are used to destroy pathogens in a process termed the respiratory burst. It is the source of reducing equivalents for cytochrome P450 hydroxylation of aromatic compounds, steroids, alcohols, and drugs. == Stability == NADH and NADPH are very stable in basic solutions, but NAD+ and NADP+ are degraded in basic solutions into a fluorescent product that can be used conveniently for quantitation. Conversely, NADPH and NADH are degraded by acidic solutions while NAD+/NADP+ are fairly stable to acid. == Enzymes that use NADP(H) as a coenzyme == Many enzymes that bind NADP share a common super-secondary structure named named the \"Rossmann fold\". The initial beta-alpha-beta (βαβ) fold is the most conserved segment of the Rossmann folds. This segment is in contact with the ADP portion of NADP. Therefore, it is also called an \"ADP-binding βαβ fold\". Adrenodoxin reductase: This enzyme is present ubiquitously in most organisms. It transfers two electrons from NADPH to FAD. In vertebrates, it serves as the first enzyme in the chain of mitochondrial P450 systems that synthesize steroid hormones. == Enzymes that use NADP(H) as a substrate == In 2018 and 2019, the first two reports of enzymes that catalyze the removal of the 2' phosphate of NADP(H) in eukaryotes emerged. First the cytoplasmic protein MESH1 (Q8N4P3), then the mitochondrial protein nocturnin were reported. Of note, the structures and NADPH binding of MESH1 (5VXA) and nocturnin (6NF0) are not related. == References ==",

         "Guanethidine is an antihypertensive drug that reduces the release of catecholamines, such as norepinephrine. Guanethidine is transported across the sympathetic nerve membrane by the same mechanism that transports norepinephrine itself (NET, uptake 1), and uptake is essential for the drug's action. Once guanethidine has entered the nerve, it is concentrated in transmitter vesicles, where it replaces norepinephrine. It may also inhibit the release of granules by decreasing norepinephrine. == Medical uses == Guanethidine was once a mainstay for hypertension resistant to other agents, and was often used safely during pregnancy, but it is no longer used in the US due to lack of availability. It is still licensed in some countries, e.g., UK, for the rapid control of blood pressure in a hypertensive emergency. Intravenous nerve block (Bier block) using guanethidine has been used to treat chronic pain caused by complex regional pain syndrome. == Side effects == Side effects include postural and exercise hypotension, sexual dysfunction (delayed or retrograde ejaculation), and diarrhea. == Pharmacology == Guanethidine is transported by uptake 1 into the presynaptic terminal transported by norepinephrine transporter (NET). (In this it competes with norepinephrine so can potentiate exogenously applied norepinephrine.) It becomes concentrated in norepinephrine transmitter vesicles, replacing norepinephrine in these vesicles. This leads to a gradual depletion of norepinephrine stores in the nerve endings. Once inside the terminal it blocks the release of norepinephrine in response to arrival of an action potential. Spontaneous release is not affected. == References ==",

         "Medical",
         "Ivabradine, sold under the brand name Procoralan among others, is a medication, which is a pacemaker current (If) inhibitor, used for the symptomatic management of heart-related chest pain and heart failure. Patients who qualify for use of ivabradine for congestive heart failure are patients who have symptomatic heart failure, with reduced ejection fraction, and heart rate at least 70 bpm, and the condition not able to be fully managed by beta blockers. Ivabradine acts by allowing negative chronotropy in the sinoatrial structure, thus reducing the heart rate via specific inhibition of the pacemaker current. It operates by a mechanism different from that of beta blockers and calcium channel blockers, which are two commonly prescribed antianginal classes of cardiac drugs. Ivabradine has no apparent inotropic properties and may be a cardiotonic agent. == Medical uses == It is used for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris in patients with normal sinus rhythm who cannot take beta blockers. It is also being used off-label in the treatment of inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST). Ivabradine stands as a pharmacological option for controlling HR and rhythm without associated side effects in postoperative CABG patients with IST. === Chest pain === Ivabradine is as effective as the beta blocker atenolol and comparable with amlodipine in the management of chronic stable angina, as demonstrated by improvements in total exercise duration in non-inferiority trials, hence it can be an alternative therapy for those who cannot tolerate conventional therapies. In people not sufficiently managed with beta blockers for their angina, adding ivabradine can further reduce heart rate and improve total exercise duration. === Heart failure === It is used in combination with beta blockers in people with heart failure with LVEF lower than 35 percent inadequately controlled by beta blockers alone and whose heart rate exceeds 70 beats per minute. In people not sufficiently managed with beta blockers for their heart failure adding ivabradine decreases the risk of hospitalization for heart failure. === Tachycardia === The clinical use of ivabradine is predicated on its mechanism of action on sinoatrial nodal tissue where it selectively inhibits the funny current (If) and results in a decrease in heart rate. Ivabradine’s most frequent application in electrophysiology is for the treatment of inappropriate sinus tachycardia. Its use for inappropriate sinus tachycardia is not a European Medicines Agency or Food and Drug Administration approved indication for ivabradine. It has been used experimentally for the treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome in patients with long COVID. It was used for POTS prior to this too. Many cardiologists have found success with this in their POTS patients. == Contraindications == Ivabradine is contraindicated in sick sinus syndrome. It should also not be used concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, including azole antifungals (such as ketoconazole), macrolide antibiotics, nefazodone and the antiretroviral drugs nelfinavir and ritonavir. Use of ivabradine with verapamil or diltiazem is contraindicated. == Adverse effects == Overall, 14.5% of patients taking ivabradine experience luminous phenomena (by patients described as sensations of enhanced brightness in a fully maintained visual field). This is probably due to blockage of Ih ion channels in the retina, which are very similar to cardiac If. These symptoms are mild, transient, and fully reversible. In clinical studies, about 1% of all patients had to discontinue the drug because of these sensations, which occurred on average 40 days after the drug was started. In a large clinical trial, bradycardia (unusually slow heart rate) occurred in 2% and 5% of patients taking ivabradine at doses of 7.5 and 10 mg respectively (compared to 4.3% in those taking atenolol). Headaches were reported in 2.6 to 4.8 percent of cases. Other common adverse drug reactions (1–10% of patients) include first-degree AV block, ventricular extrasystoles, dizziness and/or blurred vision. == Mechanism of action == Ivabradine acts on the If (f is for \"funny\", so called because it had unusual properties compared with other current systems known at the time of its discovery) ion current, which is highly expressed in the sinoatrial node. If is a mixed Na+–K+ inward current activated by hyperpolarization and modulated by the autonomic nervous system. It is one of the most important ionic currents for regulating pacemaker activity in the sinoatrial (SA) node. Ivabradine selectively inhibits the pacemaker If current in a dose-dependent manner. Blocking this channel reduces cardiac pacemaker activity, selectively slowing the heart rate and allowing more time for blood to flow to the myocardium. By inhibiting the If channel, ivabradine reduces the heart rate and workload on the heart. This is relevant in the usage of the medication to treat angina as well as congestive heart failure. This is in contrast to other commonly used rate-reducing medications, such as beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers, which not only reduce heart rate, but also the cardiac contractility. Given the selective decrease in rate without loss of contractility, ivabradine may prove efficacious for treatment of congestive heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Ivabradine binds to HCN4 receptors (potassium/sodium hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 4), utilizing Y506, F509 and I510 residues. == Clinical trials == === Coronary artery disease === The BEAUTIFUL study randomised over 10917 patients having stable coronary artery disease and left ventricle dysfunction (ejection fraction < 40%). Ivabradine did not show a significant reduction in the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, admission to hospital for acute myocardial infarction, and admission to hospital for new onset or worsening heart failure. However, in a prespecified subgroup of patients with a baseline heart rate of more than 70 bpm, ivabradine significantly reduced the following secondary endpoints: Coronary events by 22% (P=0.023) Fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction by 36% (P=0.001) Coronary revascularization by 30% (P=0.016). These results were seen in combination therapy with beta blockers, and were found to be safe and effective in improving coronary artery disease outcomes in patients with heart rates of 70 bpm or more. The SIGNIFY trial randomised 19102 patients with stable coronary artery disease and an elevated heart rate greater than 70 beats per minute were assigned to an intervention of ivabradine or placebo in addition to standard therapy. Ivabradine did not significantly improve the secondary outcomes in patient groups, however did demonstrate a reduction in heart rate. When compared to the SHIFT study, a reduction in cardiovascular death or hospital admission was also demonstrated and hence should be considered when additional therapy is in question. === Chronic heart failure === In the SHIFT study, ivabradine significantly reduced the risk of the primary composite endpoint of hospitalization for worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death by 18% (P<0.0001) compared with placebo on top of optimal therapy. These benefits were observed after 3 months of treatment. SHIFT also showed that administration of ivabradine to heart failure patients significantly reduced the risk of death from heart failure by 26% (P=0.014) and hospitalization for heart failure by 26% (P<0.0001). The improvements in outcomes were observed throughout all prespecified subgroups: female and male, with or without beta-blockers at randomization, patients below and over 65 years of age, with heart failure of ischemic or non-ischemic etiology, NYHA class II or class III, IV, with or without diabetes, and with or without hypertension. A 2020 Cochrane review found no difference in cardiovascular mortality and serious adverse events between long-term treatment with ivabradine and placebo/usual care/no treatment in participants with heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction. A note of caution must be emphasised. Ivabradine, though indicated for chronic heart failure in patients who are clinically stable, is not indicated in acute heart failure where the enhanced heart rate represents cardiac reserve. Indiscriminate use of Ivabradine could destabilise these patients. == Society and culture == === Approval === Ivabradine was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2005, and by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2015. === Alleged conflict of interest === According to a documentary and article of the Danish media channel TV2 in September 2024, a former president of the European Society of Cardiology during 2006-2008, professor Kim Fox, had a conflict of interest in relation to clinical trials of ivabradine and his recommendation of ivabradine based on the trials. According to TV2, Fox and his partner founded a company, Heart Research Ltd., which performed clinical trials and received payments from the pharmaceutical industry, allowing them to extract a total profit of 500 million DKK (67 million euro) during 2003-2015, mostly from a cooperation with the French pharmaceutical company Servier. According to TV2's research of financial statements of the company, in the period of 2004-2006, the couple received a salary of over 20 million DKK (2.7 million euro) from their company, while during the same period, Kim Fox was chairman of the taskforce recommending ivabradine, and as president of the European Society of Cardiology, he also had the role of presenting the research results and recommending ivabradin as a \"gold standard\" treatment at a European cardiological conference in 2008. Karsten Juhl Jørgensen, professor of medicine and conflict of interests expert at Odense University and the Nordic Cochrane Centre, commented that the conflict of interest was \"probably the largest he had seen\". Danish chief physician Niels Holmark Andersen commented that Fox's conflict of interest was of an \"oligarchal magnitude\" and \"the mother of all conflicts of interests\" because Fox was involved in all parts of the process, that the clinical results did not sustain claims of the superiority of the medication which has serious adverse effect, and further that Servier had marketed ivabradine \"aggressively\" and offered physicians exclusive trips to castles in France to promote the medication during the decade of 2000-2010. === Names === It is marketed by Amgen under the brand name Corlanor in the United States, and by Servier in the rest of the world under the brand names Procoralan (worldwide), Coralan (in Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and some other countries), Corlentor (in Armenia, Spain, Italy and Romania), Lancora (in Canada) and Coraxan (in Russia and Serbia). It is also marketed in India under the brand names Ivabrad, Ivabid. In Iran it's sold under the brand name \"bradix\" . IVAMAC and Bradia. During its development, ivabradine was known as S-16257. == References == == External links ==",

         "Spiramycin is a macrolide antibiotic and antiparasitic. It is used to treat toxoplasmosis and various other infections of soft tissues. Although used in Europe, Canada and Mexico, spiramycin is still considered an experimental drug in the United States, but can sometimes be obtained by special permission from the FDA for toxoplasmosis in the first trimester of pregnancy. Spiramycin has been used in Europe since the year 2000 under the trade name \"Rovamycine\", produced by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Sanofi and Famar Lyon, France and Eczacıbaşı İlaç, Turkey. It also goes under the name Rovamycine in Canada (distributed by OdanLaboratories), where it is mostly marketed to dentists for mouth infections. Spiramycin has been studied as a virulence inhibitor in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. == Medical uses == === Available forms === It is available for parenteral and oral administration. Another treatment option (typically used after 16w gestation) are a combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine (given with leucovorin). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === The antibiotic action involves inhibition of protein synthesis in the bacterial cell during translocation. Resistance to spiramycin can develop by several mechanisms and its prevalence is to a considerable extent proportional to the frequency of prescription in a given area. The antibacterial spectrum comprises Gram-positive cocci and rods, Gram-negative cocci and also Legionellae, mycoplasmas, chlamydiae, some types of spirochetes, Toxoplasma gondii and Cryptosporidium species. Enterobacteria, pseudomonads and pathogenic moulds are resistant. Its action is mainly bacteriostatic, on highly sensitive strains it exerts a bactericide action. As compared with erythromycin, it is in vitro weight for weight 5 to 20 less effective, an equipotential therapeutic dose is, however, only double. This difference between the effectiveness in vitro and in vivo is explained above all by the great affinity of spiramycin to tissues where it achieves concentrations many times higher than serum levels. An important part is played also by the slow release of the antibiotic from the tissue compartment, the marked action on microbes in sub-inhibition concentrations and the relatively long persisting post-antibiotic effect. Its great advantage is the exceptionally favourable tolerance-gastrointestinal and general. == Chemistry == Spiramycin is a 16-membered ring macrolide. == History == It was isolated in 1954 as a product of Streptomyces ambofaciens by PINNERT-SINDICO. As a preparation for oral administration it has been used since 1955, in 1987 also the parenteral form was introduced into practice. == References ==",

         "Succimer, sold under the brand name Chemet among others, is a medication tool used to treat lead, mercury, and arsenic poisoning. When it's radiolabeled with technetium-99m, it's used in many types of diagnostic testing. A full course of Succimer lasts for 19 days of oral administration. A second course should be given when more than two weeks pass after the first course. Common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and low blood neutrophil levels. Liver problems and allergic reactions may also occur with use. Whether use during pregnancy is safe for the baby is unclear. Dimercaptosuccinic acid is in the chelating agent family of medications. It works by binding with lead and a number of other heavy metals, allowing them to leave the body in the urine. Succimer has been used medically since the 1950s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In the United States, no generic version was available as of 2015. == Medical uses == Succimer is indicated for the treatment of lead poisoning in children with blood level measured above 45 μg/dL. The use of dimercaptosuccinic acid is not approved for prevention of lead poisoning in anticipation of exposure in known lead-contaminated environments. Dimercaptosuccinic acid can cross the blood–brain barrier of mice, but it is not known if this is also the case in humans. Even if dimercaptosuccinic acid cannot reverse the damages done to the central nervous system, it might prevent further deterioration. Succimer facilitates urinary excretion of lead, and with sufficiently aggressive treatment, can reduce lead content in the brain. It also increases urinary excretion of copper and zinc. Dimercaptosuccinic acid improved cognitive function in rats that had been exposed to lead, but reduced cognitive function in rats that had not been exposed to lead. == Chemistry == Succimer is an isomer of 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid. 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid is the organosulfur compound with the formula HO2CCH(SH)CH(SH)CO2H. This colorless solid contains two carboxylic acid and two thiol groups, the latter being responsible for its mildly unpleasant odour. It occurs in two diastereomers, meso and the chiral dl forms. The 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid molecule has two stereocentres (two asymmetric carbon atoms), and can exist as three different stereoisomers. The 2S,3S and 2R,3R isomers are a pair of enantiomers, whereas the 2R,3S isomer (succimer) is a meso compound and thus optically inactive. == Preparation and reactivity == Dimercaptosuccinic acid may be prepared by reacting acetylenedicarboxylic acid with sodium thiosulfate or thioacetic acid followed by hydrolysis. The dimethyl ester is also known. Meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid binds to \"soft\" heavy metals such as Hg2+ and Pb2+, mobilizing these ions for excretion. It binds to metal cations through the thiol groups, which ionize upon complexation. == History == Dimercaptosuccinic acid was first synthesized by V. L. Nirenburg in the Urals Polytechnic Institute, commissioned by one of the electrical enterprises of Sverdlovsk, Russia, which consumed many tons of mercury and was looking for a medicine to prevent poisoning of personnel. In 1957, Chinese scientists found that dimercaptosuccinic acid can effectively treat antimony poisoning due to overdose of tartar emetic. Pronounced protective effect in animal poisoning with arsenic and mercury was first shown by I. E. Okonishnikova in 1962. In 1984, the now-defunct Bock Pharmaceutical Company requested the FDA grant approval for orphan drug status under the brand name Chemet and the FDA approved of this in 1991. It provided exclusivity until 1998 which was conveyed to the successor Sanofi in 1996. == References == == Further reading ==",

         "Medical",
         "Valsartan, sold under the brand name Diovan among others, is a medication used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and diabetic kidney disease. It belongs to a class of medications referred to as angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). It is a reasonable initial treatment for high blood pressure. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include feeling tired, dizziness, high blood potassium, diarrhea, and joint pain. Other serious side effects may include kidney problems, low blood pressure, and angioedema. Use in pregnancy may harm the baby and use when breastfeeding is not recommended. It is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist and works by blocking the effects of angiotensin II. Valsartan was patented in 1990, and came into medical use in 1996. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 117th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Valsartan is used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and to reduce death for people with left ventricular dysfunction after having a heart attack. === High blood pressure === Valsartan (and other ARBs) are an appropriate initial treatment option for most people with high blood pressure and no other coexisting conditions, as are ACE inhibitors, thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers. If patients have coexisting diabetes or kidney disease, ARBs or ACE inhibitors may be considered over other classes of blood pressure medicines. === Heart failure === Valsartan has reduced rates of mortality and heart failure hospitalisations when used alone or in combination with beta blockers in the treatment of heart failure. Importantly, the combination of valsartan and ACE inhibitors has not shown morbidity or mortality benefits but rather increases mortality risk when added to combination beta blocker and ACE inhibitor therapy, and increases the risk of adverse events like hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal failure. As shown in the PARADIGM-HF study, valsartan combined with sacubitril for the treatment of heart failure, significantly reduced all cause and cardiovascular mortality and hospitalisations due to heart failure. === Diabetic kidney disease === In people with type 2 diabetes, antihypertensive therapy with valsartan decreases the rate of progression of albuminuria (albumin in urine), promotes regression to normoalbuminuria and may reduce the rate of progression to end-stage kidney disease. == Contraindications == The packaging for valsartan includes a warning stating the drug should not be used with the renin inhibitor aliskiren in people with diabetes. It also states the safety of the drug in severe renal impairment has not been established. Valsartan includes a black box warning for fetal toxicity. Discontinuation of these agents is recommended immediately after detection of pregnancy and an alternative medication should be started. Breastfeeding is not recommended. == Side effects == Side effects depend on the reason the medication is being used. === Heart failure === Adverse effects are based on a comparison versus placebo in people with heart failure. Most common side effects include dizziness (17% vs 9% ), low blood pressure (7% vs 2%), and diarrhea (5% vs 4%). Less common side effects include joint pain, fatigue, and back pain (all 3% vs 2%). === Hypertension === Clinical trials for valsartan treatment for hypertension versus placebo demonstrate side effects like viral infection (3% vs 2%), fatigue (2% vs 1%) and abdominal pain (2% vs 1%). Minor side effects that occurred at >1% but were similar to rates from the placebo group include: headache dizziness upper respiratory infection cough diarrhea rhinitis/sinusitis nausea pharyngitis edema arthralgia === Kidney failure === People treated with ARBs including valsartan or diuretics are susceptible to conditions of developing low renal blood flow such as abnormal narrowing of blood vessels in the kidney, hypertension, renal artery stenosis, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion whose renal function is in part dependent on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system like efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction done by angiotensin II are at high risk of deterioration of renal function comprising acute kidney failure, oliguria, worsening azotemia or heightened serum creatinine. When blood flow to the kidneys is reduced, the kidney activates a series of responses that triggers angiotensin release to constrict blood vessels and facilitate blood flow in the kidney. So long as the nephron function degradation is progressive or reaches clinically significant levels, withholding or discontinuing valsartan is warranted. == Interactions == The US prescribing information lists the following drug interactions for valsartan: Other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system may increase the risks of low blood pressure, kidney problems, and hyperkalemia. Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium may increase the risk of hyperkalemia. NSAIDs may increase the risk of kidney problems and may interfere with blood pressure-lowering effects. Valsartan may increase the concentration of lithium. Valsartan and other angiotensin-related blood pressure medications may interact with the antibiotics co-trimoxazole or ciprofloxacin to increase risk of sudden death due to cardiac arrest. === Food interaction === With the tablet, food decreases the valsartan tablet taker's exposure to valsartan by about 40% and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50%, evidenced by AUC change. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Valsartan blocks the actions of angiotensin II, which include constricting blood vessels and activating aldosterone, to reduce blood pressure. The drug binds to angiotensin type I receptors (AT1), working as an antagonist. This mechanism of action is different than that of the ACE inhibitor drugs, which block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. As valsartan acts at the receptor, it can provide more complete angiotensin II antagonism since angiotensin II is generated by other enzymes as well as ACE. Also, valsartan does not affect the metabolism of bradykinin like ACE inhibitors do. === Pharmacodynamics === === Pharmacokinetics === The peak concentration of valsartan in plasma occurs 2 to 4 hours after dosing. AUC and Cmax values of valsartan are observed to be approximately linearly dose-dependent over therapeutic dosing range. Owing to its relatively short elimination half life attribution, valsartan concentration in plasma does not accumulate in response to repeated dosing. == Society and culture == === Economics === In 2010, valsartan (trade name Diovan) achieved annual sales of $2.052 billion in the United States and $6.053 billion worldwide. The patents for valsartan and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide expired in September 2012. === Combinations === Versions are available as the combinations valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/amlodipine, valsartan/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/nebivolol, and valsartan/sacubitril. Valsartan is combined with amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) (or both) into single-pill formulations for treating hypertension with multiple drugs. Valsartan is also available as the combination valsartan/sacubitril. It is used to treat heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. === Recalls === In July 2018, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recalled certain batches of valsartan and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide film-coated tablets distributed in 22 countries in the European Union. Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical Co. (ZHP) in Linhai, China manufactured the bulk ingredient contaminated by N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a carcinogen. The active pharmaceutical ingredient was subsequently imported by a number of generic drugmakers, including Novartis, and marketed in Europe and Asia under their subsidiary Sandoz labeling, and in the UK by Dexcel Pharma Ltd and Accord Healthcare. Valsartan was recalled in Canada. Authorities believe the degree of contamination is negligible. In July 2018, The National Agency of Drug and Food Control (NA-DFC or Badan POM Indonesia) announced voluntary recalls for two products containing valsartan produced by Actavis Indonesia and Dipa Pharmalab Intersains. In July 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced voluntary recalls of certain supplies of valsartan and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide in the US distributed by Solco Healthcare LLC, Major Pharmaceuticals, and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. Hong Kong's Department of Health initiated a similar recall. In August 2018, the FDA published two lengthy, updated lists, classifying hundreds of specific US products containing valsartan into those included versus excluded from the recall. A week later, the FDA cited two more drugmakers, Zhejiang Tianyu Pharmaceuticals of China and Hetero Labs Limited of India, as additional sources of the contaminated valsartan ingredient. In September 2018, the FDA announced that retesting of all valsartan supplies had found a second carcinogenic impurity, N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), in the recalled products made by ZHP in China and marketed in the US under the Torrent Pharmaceuticals (India) brand. According to a 2018 Reuters analysis of national medicines agencies' records, more than 50 companies around the world have recalled valsartan mono-preparations or combination products manufactured from the tainted valsartan ingredient. The contamination has likely been present since 2012 when the manufacturing process was changed and approved by EDQM and FDA authorities. Based on inspections in late 2018, both agencies have suspended the Chinese and Indian manufacturers' certificates of suitability for the supply of valsartan in the EU and the US. In 2019, many more preparations of valsartan and its combinations were recalled due to the presence of the contaminant NDMA. In August 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) provided guidance to marketing authorization holders on how to avoid the presence of nitrosamine impurities in human medicines and asked them to review all chemical and biological human medicines for the possible presence of nitrosamines and to test the products at risk. The FDA issued revised guidelines about nitrosamine impurities in September 2024. === Shortages === Since July 2018, numerous recalls of losartan, valsartan and irbesartan drug products have caused marked shortages of these life saving medications in North America and Europe, particularly for valsartan. In March 2019, the FDA approved an additional generic version of valsartan to address the issue. According to the agency, the shortage of valsartan was resolved in April 2020, but the availability of the generic form remained unstable into July 2020. Pharmacies in the European Union were notified that the supply of the drug, particularly for higher dosage forms, would remain unstable well into December 2020. == Research == In people with impaired glucose tolerance, valsartan may decrease the incidence of developing diabetes mellitus type 2. However, the absolute risk reduction is small (less than 1 percent per year) and diet, exercise or other drugs, may be more protective. In the same study, no reduction in the rate of cardiovascular events (including death) was shown. In one study of people without diabetes, valsartan reduced the risk of developing diabetes mellitus over amlodipine, mainly for those with hypertension. A prospective study demonstrated a reduction in the incidence and progression of Alzheimer's disease and dementia. == References ==",

         "Medical",
         "Binimetinib, sold under the brand name Mektovi, is an anti-cancer medication used to treat various cancers. Binimetinib is a selective inhibitor of MEK, a central kinase in the tumor-promoting MAPK pathway. Inappropriate activation of the pathway has been shown to occur in many cancers. In June 2018 it was approved by the FDA in combination with encorafenib for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive melanoma. In October 2023, it was approved by the FDA for treatment of NSCLC with a BRAF V600E mutation in combination with encorafenib. It was developed by Array Biopharma. == Mechanism of action == Binimetinib is an orally available inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), or more specifically, a MAP2K inhibitor. MEK is part of the RAS pathway, which is involved in cell proliferation and survival. MEK is upregulated in many forms of cancer. Binimetinib, uncompetitive with ATP, binds to and inhibits the activity of MEK1/2 kinase, which has been shown to regulate several key cellular activities including proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. MEK1/2 are dual-specificity threonine/tyrosine kinases that play key roles in the activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway and are often upregulated in a variety of tumor cell types. Inhibition of MEK1/2 prevents the activation of MEK1/2 dependent effector proteins and transcription factors, which may result in the inhibition of growth factor-mediated cell signaling. As demonstrated in preclinical studies, this may eventually lead to an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and an inhibition in production of various inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1, -6 and tumor necrosis factor. == Development == In 2015, it was in phase III clinical trials for ovarian cancer, BRAF mutant melanoma, and NRAS Q61 mutant melanoma. In December 2015, the company announced that the mutant-NRAS melanoma trial was successful. In the trial, those receiving binimetinib had a median progression-free survival of 2.8 months versus 1.5 months for those on the standard dacarbazine treatment. NDA submitted Jun 2016, and the FDA should decide by 30 June 2017. In April 2016, it was reported that the phase III trial for low-grade ovarian cancer was terminated due to lack of efficacy. In 2017, the FDA informed Array Biopharma that the phase III trial data was not sufficient and the New Drug Application was withdrawn. In June 2018, it was approved for the treatment of certain melanomas by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in combination with encorafenib. The FDA approved binimetinib based primarily on evidence from one clinical trial (NCT01909453) of 383 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma that was advanced or could not be removed by surgery. The trial was conducted at 162 sites in Europe, North America, and various countries around the world. In October 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration approved encorafenib with binimetinib for adults with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a BRAF V600E mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test. == References == == External links ==",

         "Medical",
         "Donepezil, sold under the brand name Aricept among others, is a medication used to treat dementia of the Alzheimer's type. It appears to result in a small benefit in mental function and ability to function. Use, however, has not been shown to change the progression of the disease. Treatment should be stopped if no benefit is seen. It is taken by mouth or via a transdermal patch. Donepezil is a centrally acting reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and structurally unrelated to other anticholinesterase agents. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping, aggression, diarrhea, feeling tired, and muscle cramps. Serious side effects may include abnormal heart rhythms, urinary incontinence, and seizures. Donepezil was approved for medical use in the United States in 1996. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 146th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Alzheimer's disease === There is no evidence that donepezil or other similar agents alter the course or progression of Alzheimer's disease. Six-to-twelve-month controlled studies have shown modest benefits in cognition or behavior. The UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends donepezil as an option in the management of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. The person should, however, be reviewed frequently and if there is no significant benefit it should be stopped. In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also approved donepezil for treatment of mild, moderate and severe dementia in Alzheimer's disease. === Other === Lewy body dementia: Some studies have shown benefits of donepezil for the treatment of cognitive and behavioral symptoms in Lewy body dementia. Traumatic brain injury: Some research suggests an improvement in memory dysfunction in patients with traumatic brain injury with donepezil use. Vascular dementia: Studies have shown that donepezil may improve cognition in patients with vascular dementia but not overall global functioning. Dementia associated with Parkinson disease: Some evidence suggests that donepezil can improve cognition, executive function, and global status in Parkinson disease dementia. == Adverse effects == In clinical trials the most common adverse events leading to discontinuation were nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. Other side effects included difficulty sleeping, muscle cramps and loss of appetite. Most side effects were observed in patients taking the 23 mg dose compared to 10 mg or lower doses. Side effects are mild and transient in most patients, lasting up to three weeks and usually improved even with continued use. Donepezil, like other cholinesterase inhibitors, can cause nightmares due to enhanced activation of the visual association cortex during REM sleep. Dosing donepezil in the morning can reduce the frequency of nightmares. === Precautions === Donepezil should be used with caution in people with heart disease, cardiac conduction disturbances, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, severe cardiac arrhythmia and sick sinus syndrome. People with peptic ulcer disease or taking NSAIDs should use with caution because increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was noted. Slow heart beat and fainting in people with heart problems were also seen. These symptoms may appear more frequent when initiating treatment or increasing the donepezil dose. Although occurrence of seizures is rare, people who have a predisposition to seizures should be treated with caution. If daily donepezil has suspended for 7 days or less, restarting at the same dose is recommended, while if the suspension lasts longer than 7 days, retitrate from 5 mg daily is suggested. == Mechanism of action == Donepezil binds and reversibly inhibits enzymes called cholinesterases, especially acetylcholinesterase, thus inhibiting hydrolysis of acetylcholine. This increases acetylcholine concentrations at cholinergic synapses. The precise mechanism of action of donepezil in patients with Alzheimer's disease is not fully understood. Certainly, Alzheimer's disease involves a substantial loss of the elements of the cholinergic system and it is generally accepted that the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease are related to this cholinergic deficit, particularly in the cerebral cortex and other areas of the brain. In addition to its actions as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, donepezil has been found to act as a potent agonist of the σ1 receptor (Ki = 14.6 nM), and has been shown to produce specific antiamnestic effects in animals mainly via this action. Some noncholinergic mechanisms have also been proposed. Donepezil upregulates the nicotinic receptors in the cortical neurons, adding to neuroprotective activity. It inhibits voltage-activated sodium currents reversibly and delays rectifier potassium currents and fast transient potassium currents, although this action is unlikely to contribute to clinical effects. == Synergy == Donepezil was claimed to act synergistically with an agent called FK962 [283167-06-6] & FK960 [133920-70-4]. {potential activation of somatostatinergic neurotransmission} However, the development was discontinued after Phase II \"since the data reviewed did not indicate clear efficacy of the compound for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.\" == Stereochemistry == Donepezil medications are racemates. == History == Research leading to the development of donepezil began in 1983, at Eisai, and in 1996, Eisai received approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for donepezil under the brand Aricept, which it co-marketed with Pfizer. The team at Eisai was led by Hachiro Sugimoto. As of 2011, Aricept was the world's best-selling Alzheimer's disease treatment. The first generic donepezil became available in November 2010, with the US FDA approval of a formulation prepared by Ranbaxy Labs. == Research == Donepezil has been tested in other cognitive disorders, including Lewy body dementia, and vascular dementia, but it is not currently approved for these indications. Donepezil has also been found to improve sleep apnea in people with Alzheimer's. It also improves gait in people with mild Alzheimer's. Donepezil has also been studied in people with mild cognitive impairment, schizophrenia, attention deficit disorder, post-coronary artery bypass surgery cognitive impairment, cognitive impairment associated with multiple sclerosis, CADASIL syndrome, and Down syndrome. A three-year National Institutes of Health trial in people with mild cognitive impairment reported donepezil was superior to placebo in delaying rate of progression to dementia during the initial 18 months of the study, but this was not sustained at 36 months. In a secondary analysis, a subgroup of individuals with the apolipoprotein E4 genotype showed sustained benefits with donepezil throughout the study. At this time, though, donepezil is not indicated for prevention of dementia. === Cognitive enhancement === Donepezil has shown mixed results for improving cognitive abilities in healthy individuals. A 2009 double-blind, placebo controlled study (n=24) investigating donepezil's effects across a variety of memory tests in reported an improvement in spatial memory accuracy both before (90 minutes after dosing) and at theoretical Tmax (210 minutes after dosing). However, a later 2011 paper featuring two study double-blind, placebo controlled experiments evaluating donepezil's effects in older but healthy subjects reported impairment after acute (5 hours after dose) and chronic (4 weeks) donepezil administration. === ADHD === The addition of donepezil with existing ADHD medications has shown mixed results. In those with Tourette syndrome and ADHD, donepezil may reduce tics while it had no effect on ADHD's symptoms. === Pervasive developmental disorder === Donepezil, along with other cholinesterase inhibitors, is suggested as having potential for trouble behaviors: irritability, hyperactivity, and difficulty in social communication which are typically seen in those with pervasive developmental disorder, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, and autism-spectrum disorder. === Anorexia nervosa === Donepezil is furthermore suggested as a feasible therapeutic option for anorexia nervosa. Emerging literature reports that a subset of patients suffering from restrictive anorexia nervosa have enhanced habit formation compared with healthy controls. Habit formation is modulated by striatal cholinergic interneurons. Based on the physiopathology of anorexia nervosa, namely in terms of cholinergic deficiencies, the effects of donepezil and other drugs that act as cholinesterase inhibitors could thus be effective in the treatment of the disorder. However, no trial to date supports this hypothesis. == References == == Further reading == Brenner GD, Brenner GM (2000). Pharmacology. Philadelphia: W. B. Saunders. ISBN 978-0-7216-7757-6.

         "Medical",
         "Estramustine phosphate (EMP), also known as estradiol normustine phosphate and sold under the brand names Emcyt and Estracyt, is a dual estrogen and chemotherapy medication which is used in the treatment of prostate cancer in men. It is taken multiple times a day by mouth or by injection into a vein. Side effects of EMP include nausea, vomiting, gynecomastia, feminization, demasculinization, sexual dysfunction, blood clots, and cardiovascular complications. EMP is a dual cytostatic and hence chemotherapeutic agent and a hormonal anticancer agent of the estrogen type. It is a prodrug of estramustine and estromustine in terms of its cytostatic effects and a prodrug of estradiol in relation to its estrogenic effects. EMP has strong estrogenic effects at typical clinical dosages, and consequently has marked antigonadotropic and functional antiandrogenic effects. EMP was introduced for medical use in the early 1970s. It is available in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, other European countries, and elsewhere in the world. == Medical uses == EMP is indicated, in the United States, for the palliative treatment of metastatic and/or progressive prostate cancer, whereas in the United Kingdom it is indicated for the treatment of unresponsive or relapsing prostate cancer. The medication is usually reserved for use in hormone-refractory cases of prostate cancer, although it has been used as a first-line monotherapy as well. Response rates with EMP in prostate cancer are said to be equivalent to conventional high-dose estrogen therapy. Due to its relatively severe side effects and toxicity, EMP has rarely been used in the treatment of prostate cancer. This is especially true in Western countries today. As a result, and also due to the scarce side effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormone modulators (GnRH modulators) like leuprorelin, EMP was almost abandoned. However, encouraging clinical research findings resulted in renewed interest of EMP for the treatment of prostate cancer. EMP has been used at doses of 140 to 1,400 mg/day orally in the treatment of prostate cancer. However, oral EMP is most commonly used at a dose of 560 to 640 mg/day (280–320 mg twice daily). The recommended dosage of oral EMP in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) label for Emcyt is 14 mg per kg of body weight (i.e., one 140 mg oral capsule for each 10 kg or 22 lbs of body weight) given in 3 or 4 divided doses per day. The label states that most patients in studies of oral EMP in the United States have received 10 to 16 mg per kg per day. This would be about 900 to 1,440 mg/day for a 90-kg or 200-lb man. Lower doses of oral EMP, such as 280 mg/day, have been found to have comparable effectiveness as higher doses but with improved tolerability and reduced toxicity. Doses of 140 mg/day have been described as a very low dosage. EMP has been used at doses of 240 to 450 mg/day intravenously. EMP and other estrogens such as polyestradiol phosphate and ethinylestradiol are far less costly than newer therapies such as GnRH modulators, abiraterone acetate, and enzalutamide. In addition, estrogens may offer significant benefits over other means of androgen deprivation therapy, for instance in terms of bone loss and fractures, hot flashes, cognition, and metabolic status. EMP has been used to prevent the testosterone flare at the start of GnRH agonist therapy in men with prostate cancer. === Available forms === EMP is or has been available in the form of both capsules (140 mg, 280 mg) for oral administration and aqueous solutions (300 mg) for intravenous injection. == Contraindications == EMP is contraindicated when used in children, patients hypersensitive to estrogens or nitrogen mustards, those with peptic ulcer (an ulcer in the digestive tract), those with severely compromised liver function, those with weak heart muscle (also known as myocardial insufficiency) and those with thromboembolic disorders or complications related to fluid retention. == Side effects == The side effects of EMP overall have been described as relatively severe. The most common side effects of EMP have been reported to be gastrointestinal side effects like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, with nausea and vomiting occurring in 40% of men. They are usually mild or moderate in severity, and the nausea and vomiting can be managed with prophylactic antiemetic medications. Nonetheless, severe cases of gastrointestinal side effects with EMP may require dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy. Although nausea and vomiting have been reported to be the most common side effects of EMP, gynecomastia (male breast development) has been found to occur in as many as 83% of men treated with EMP, and the incidence of erectile dysfunction is possibly similar to or slightly less than the risk of gynecomastia. As a rule, feminization, a gynoid fat distribution, demasculinization, and impotence are said to occur in virtually or nearly 100% of men treated with high-dose estrogen therapy. Decreased sexual activity has also been reported in men treated with EMP. These side effects are due to high estrogen levels and low testosterone levels. Prophylactic irradiation of the breasts can be used to decrease the incidence and severity of gynecomastia with estrogens. Severe adverse effects of EMP are thromboembolic and cardiovascular complications including pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, stroke, thrombophlebitis, coronary artery disease (ischemic heart disease; e.g., myocardial infarction), thrombophlebitis, and congestive heart failure with fluid retention. EMP produces cardiovascular toxicity similarly to diethylstilbestrol, but to a lesser extent in comparison at low doses (e.g., 280 mg/day oral EMP vs. 1 mg/day oral diethylstilbestrol). The prostate cancer disease state also increases the risk of thromboembolism, and combination with docetaxel may exacerbate the risk of thromboembolism as well. Meta-analyses of clinical trials have found that the overall risk of thromboembolism with EMP is 4 to 7%, relative to 0.4% for chemotherapy regimens without EMP. Thromboembolism is the major toxicity-related cause of discontinuation of EMP. Anticoagulant therapy with medications such as aspirin, warfarin, unfractionated and low-molecular-weight heparin, and vitamin K antagonists can be useful for decreasing the risk of thromboembolism with EMP and other estrogens like diethylstilbestrol and ethinylestradiol. Adverse liver function tests are commonly seen with EMP, but severe liver dysfunction is rare with the medication. Central nervous system side effects are rarely seen with EMP, although enlarged ventricles and neuronal pigmentation have been reported in monkeys treated with very high doses of EMP (20–140 mg/kg/day) for 3 to 6 months. EMP does not appear to have cytostatic effects in normal brain tissue. In women treated with EMP in clinical studies, a few instances of minor gynecological hemorrhages have been observed. EMP is described as relatively well tolerated among cytostatic antineoplastic and nitrogen-mustard agents, rarely or not at all being associated with significant hematologic toxicity such as myelosuppression (bone marrow suppression), gastrointestinal toxicity, or other more marked toxicity associated with such agents. In contrast to most other cytostatic agents, which often cause myelosuppression, leukopenia (decreased white blood cell count), and neutropenia (decreased neutrophil count), EMP actually produces leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count) as a side effect. In a small low-dose study using 280 mg/day oral EMP for 150 days, tolerability was significantly improved, with gastrointestinal irritation occurring in only 15% of men, and there was no incidence of severe cardiovascular toxicity or deep vein thrombosis. In addition, no other side effects besides slight transient elevated liver enzymes were observed. These findings suggest that lower doses of oral EMP may be a safer option than higher doses for the treatment of prostate cancer. However, a subsequent 2004 meta-analysis of 23 studies of thromboembolic events with EMP found substantial incidence of thromboembolic events regardless of dosage and no association of EMP dose with risk of these complications. == Overdose == There has been no clinical experience with overdose of EMP. Overdose of EMP may result in pronounced manifestations of the known adverse effects of the medication. There is no specific antidote for overdose of EMP. In the event of overdose, gastric lavage should be used to evacuate gastric contents as necessary and treatment should be symptom-based and supportive. In the case of dangerously low counts of red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets, whole blood may be given as needed. Liver function should be monitored with EMP overdose. After an overdose of EMP, hematological and hepatic parameters should continue to be monitored for at least 6 weeks. EMP has been used at high doses of as much as 1,260 mg/day by the oral route and 240 to 450 mg/day by intravenous injection. == Interactions == EMP has been reported to increase the efficacy and toxicity of tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline and imipramine. When products containing calcium, aluminium, and/or magnesium, such as dairy products like milk, various foods dietary supplements, and antacids, are consumed concomitantly with EMP, an insoluble chelate complex/phosphate salt between EMP and these metals can be formed, and this can markedly impair the absorption and hence oral bioavailability of EMP. There may be an increased risk of angioedema in those concurrently taking ACE inhibitors. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === EMP, also known as estradiol normustine phosphate, is a combined estrogen ester and nitrogen mustard ester. It consists of estradiol, an estrogen, linked with a phosphate ester as well as an ester of normustine, a nitrogen mustard. In terms of its pharmacodynamic effects, EMP is a prodrug of estramustine, estromustine, and estradiol. As a prodrug of estradiol, EMP is an estrogen and hence an agonist of the estrogen receptors. EMP itself has only very weak affinity for the estrogen receptors. The medication is of about 91% higher molecular weight than estradiol due to the presence of its C3 normustine and C17β phosphate esters. Because EMP is a prodrug of estradiol, it may be considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of estrogen, although it does have additional cytostatic activity via estramustine and estromustine. EMP acts by a dual mechanism of action: 1) direct cytostatic activity via a number of actions; and 2) as a form of high-dose estrogen therapy via estrogen receptor-mediated antigonadotropic and functional antiandrogenic effects. The antigonadotropic and functional antiandrogenic effects of EMP consist of strong suppression of gonadal androgen production and hence circulating levels of androgens such as testosterone; greatly increased levels of sex hormone-binding globulin and hence a decreased fraction of free androgens in the circulation; and direct antiandrogenic actions in prostate cells. The free androgen index with oral EMP has been found to be on average 4.6-fold lower than with orchiectomy. As such, EMP therapy results in considerably stronger androgen deprivation than orchiectomy. Metabolites of EMP, including estramustine, estromustine, estradiol, and estrone, have been found to act as weak antagonists of the androgen receptor (EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration = 0.5–3.1 μM), although the clinical significance of this is unknown. Extremely high levels of estradiol and estrone occur during EMP therapy. The estrogenic metabolites of EMP are responsible for its most common adverse effects and its cardiovascular toxicity. EMP has been described as having relatively weak estrogenic effects in some publications. However, it has shown essentially the same rates and degrees of estrogenic effects, such as breast tenderness, gynecomastia, cardiovascular toxicity, changes in liver protein synthesis, and testosterone suppression, as high-dose diethylstilbestrol and ethinylestradiol in clinical studies. The notion that EMP has relatively weak estrogen activity may have been based on animal research, which found that EMP had 100-fold lower uterotrophic effects than estradiol in rats, and may also not have taken into account the very high doses of EMP used clinically in humans. The mechanism of action of the cytostatic effects of EMP is complex and only partially understood. EMP is considered to mainly be a mitotic inhibitor, inhibiting mechanisms involved in the mitosis phase of the cell cycle. Specifically, it binds to microtubule-associated proteins and/or to tubulin and produces depolymerization of microtubules (Kd = 10–20 μM for estramustine), resulting in the arrest of cell division in the G2/M phase (specifically metaphase). EMP was originally thought to mediate its cytostatic effects as a prodrug of normustine, a nitrogen mustard, and hence was thought to be an alkylating antineoplastic agent. However, subsequent research has found that EMP is devoid of alkylating actions, and that the influence of EMP on microtubules is mediated by intact estramustine and estromustine, with normustine or estradiol alone having only minor or negligible effects. As such, the unique properties of the estramustine and estromustine structures, containing a carbamate-ester bond, appear to be responsible for the cytostatic effects of EMP. In addition to its antimitotic actions, EMP has also been found to produce other cytostatic effects, including induction of apoptosis, interference with DNA synthesis, nuclear matrix interaction, cell membrane alterations, induction of reactive oxygen species (free oxygen radicals), and possibly additional mechanisms. EMP has been found to have a radiosensitizing effect in prostate cancer and glioma cells, improving sensitivity to radiation therapy as well. The cytostatic metabolites of EMP are accumulated in tissues in a selective manner, for instance in prostate cancer cells. This may be due to the presence of a specific estramustine-binding protein (EMBP) (Kd = 10–35 nM for estramustine), also known as prostatin or prostatic secretion protein (PSP), which has been detected in prostate cancer, glioma, melanoma, and breast cancer cells. Because of its tissue selectivity, EMP is said to produce minimal cytostatic effects in healthy tissues, and its tissue selectivity may be responsible for its therapeutic cytostatic efficacy against prostate cancer cells. EMP was originally developed as a dual ester prodrug of an estrogen and normustine as a nitrogen mustard alkylating antineoplastic agent which, due to the affinity of the estrogen moiety for estrogen receptors, would be selectively accumulated in estrogen target tissues and hence estrogen receptor-positive tumor cells. Consequentially, it was thought that EMP would preferentially deliver the alkylating normustine moiety to these tissues, allowing for reduced cytostatic effects in healthy tissues and hence improved efficacy and tolerability. However, subsequent research found that there is very limited and slow cleavage of the normustine ester and that EMP is devoid of alkylating activity. In addition, it appears that estramustine and estromustine may be preferentially accumulated in estrogen target tissues not due to affinity for the estrogen receptors, but instead due to affinity for the distinct EMBP. Extremely high, pregnancy-like levels of estradiol may be responsible for the leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count) that is observed in individuals treated with EMP. This side effect is in contrast to most other cytotoxic agents, which instead cause myelosuppression (bone marrow suppression), leukopenia (decreased white blood cell count), and neutropenia (decreased neutrophil count). ==== Antigonadotropic effects ==== EMP at a dosage 280 mg/day has been found to suppress testosterone levels in men into the castrate range (to 30 ng/dL) within 20 days and to the low castrate range (to 10 ng/dL) within 30 days. Similarly, a dosage of 70 mg/day EMP suppressed testosterone levels into the castrate range within 4 weeks. === Pharmacokinetics === Upon oral ingestion, EMP is rapidly and completely dephosphorylated by phosphatases into estramustine during the first pass in the gastrointestinal tract. Estramustine is also partially but considerably oxidized into estromustine by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases during the first pass. As such, EMP reaches the circulation as estramustine and estromustine, and the major metabolite of EMP is estromustine. A limited quantity of approximately 10 to 15% of estramustine and estromustine is further slowly metabolized via hydrolysis of the normustine ester into estradiol and estrone, respectively. This reaction is believed to be catalyzed by carbamidases, although the genes encoding the responsible enzymes have not been characterized. The circulating levels of normustine formed from EMP are insignificant. Release of nitrogen mustard gas from normustine via cleavage of the carboxylic acid group has not been demonstrated and does not seem to occur. The oral bioavailability of EMP is low, which is due to profound first-pass metabolism; specifically, dephosphorylation of EMP. The oral bioavailability of EMP specifically as estramustine and estromustine is 44 to 75%, suggesting that absorption may be incomplete. In any case, there is a linear relationship between the oral dose of EMP and circulating levels of estramustine and estromustine. Consumption of calcium, aluminium, or magnesium with oral EMP can markedly impair its bioavailability due to diminished absorption from the intestines, and this may interfere with its therapeutic effectiveness at low doses. Following a single oral dose of 420 mg EMP in men with prostate cancer, maximal levels of estromustine were 310 to 475 ng/mL (475,000 pg/mL) and occurred after 2 to 3 hours. Estradiol levels with 280 mg/day oral EMP have been found to increase to very high concentrations within one week of therapy. In one study, levels of estradiol were over 20,000 pg/mL after 10 days, were about 30,000 pg/mL after 30 days, and peaked at about 40,000 pg/mL at 50 days. Another study found lower estradiol levels of 4,900 to 9,000 pg/mL during chronic therapy with 560 mg/day oral EMP. An additional study found estradiol levels of about 17,000 pg/mL with 140 mg/day oral EMP and 38,000 pg/mL with 280 mg/day oral EMP. The circulating levels of estradiol and estrone during EMP therapy have been reported to exceed normal levels in men by more than 100- and 1,000-fold, respectively. Levels of estramustine and estradiol in the circulation are markedly lower than those of estromustine and estrone, respectively, with a ratio of about 1:10 in both cases. Nonetheless, estradiol levels during EMP therapy appear to be similar to those that occur in mid-to-late pregnancy, which range from 5,000 to 40,000 pg/mL. No unchanged EMP is seen in the circulation with oral administration. The pharmacokinetics of EMP are different with intravenous injection. Following a single intravenous injection of 300 mg EMP, levels of EMP were higher than those of its metabolites for the first 8 hours. This is likely due to the bypassing of first-pass metabolism. However, by 24 hours after the dose, unchanged EMP could no longer be detected in the circulation. The clearance of EMP from blood plasma is 4.85 ± 0.684 L/h. The volumes of distribution of EMP with intravenous injection were small; under a two-compartment model, the volume of distribution for the central compartment was 0.043 L/kg and for the peripheral compartment was 0.11 L/kg. The plasma protein binding of EMP is high. Estramustine is accumulated in tumor tissue, for instance prostate cancer and glioma tissue, with estramustine levels much higher in these tissues than in plasma (e.g., 6.3- and 15.9-fold, respectively). Conversely, levels of estromustine in tumor versus plasma are similar (1.0- and 0.5-fold, respectively). Estramustine and estromustine appear to accumulate in adipose tissue. The elimination half-life of estromustine with oral EMP was 13.6 hours on average, with a range of 8.8 to 22.7 hours. Conversely, the elimination half-life of estromustine with intravenous injection was 10.3 hours, with a range of 7.36 to 12.3 hours. For comparison, the corresponding elimination half-lives of estrone were 16.5 and 14.7 hours for oral and intravenous administration, respectively. Estramustine and estromustine are mainly excreted in bile and hence in feces. They are not believed to be excreted in urine. == Chemistry == EMP, also known as estradiol 3-normustine 17β-phosphate or as estradiol 3-(bis(2-chloroethyl)carbamate) 17β-(dihydrogen phosphate), is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of estradiol. It is an estrogen ester; specifically, EMP is a diester of estradiol with a C3 normustine (nitrogen mustard–carbamate moiety) ester and a C17β phosphate ester. EMP is provided as the sodium or meglumine salt. EMP is similar as a compound to other estradiol esters such as estradiol sulfate and estradiol valerate, but differs in the presence of its nitrogen mustard ester moiety. Antineoplastic agents related to EMP, although none of them were marketed, include alestramustine, atrimustine, cytestrol acetate, estradiol mustard, ICI-85966, and phenestrol. Due to its hydrophilic phosphate ester moiety, EMP is a readily water-soluble compound. This is in contrast to most other estradiol esters, which are fatty acid esters and lipophilic compounds that are not particularly soluble in water. Unlike EMP, estramustine is highly lipophilic, practically insoluble in water, and non-ionizable. The phosphate ester of EMP was incorporated into the molecule in order to increase its water solubility and allow for intravenous administration. The molecular weight of EMP sodium is 564.3 g/mol, of EMP meglumine is 715.6 g/mol, of EMP is 520.4 g/mol, of estramustine is 440.4 g/mol, and of estradiol is 272.4 g/mol. As a result of these differences in molecular weights, EMP contains about 52%, EMP sodium about 48%, and EMP meglumine about 38% of the amount of estradiol within their structures as does an equal-mass quantity of estradiol. == History == EMP was first synthesized in the mid-1960s and was patented in 1967. It was initially developed for the treatment of breast cancer. The idea for EMP was inspired by the uptake and accumulation of radiolabeled estrogens into breast cancer tissue. However, initial clinical findings of EMP in women with breast cancer were disappointing. Subsequently, radiolabeled EMP was found to be taken up into and accumulated rat prostate gland, and this finding culminated in the medication being repurposed for the treatment of prostate cancer. EMP was introduced for medical use in the treatment of this condition in the early 1970s, and was approved in the United States for this indication in 1981. EMP was originally introduced for use by intravenous injection. Subsequently, an oral formulation was introduced, and the intravenous preparation was almost abandoned in favor of the oral version. == Society and culture == === Generic names === EMP is provided as the sodium salt for oral administration, which has the generic names estramustine phosphate sodium (USANTooltip United States Adopted Name) and estramustine sodium phosphate (BANMTooltip British Approved Name, JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name), and as the meglumine salt for intravenous administration, which has the generic name estramustine phosphate meglumine. The INNMTooltip International Nonproprietary Name is estramustine phosphate. The name estramustine phosphate is a contraction of estradiol normustine phosphate. EMP is also known by its former developmental code names Leo 299, Ro 21-8837, and Ro 21-8837/001. === Brand names === EMP is most commonly marketed under the brand names Estracyt and Emcyt, but has also been sold under a number of other brand names, including Amsupros, Biasetyl, Cellmustin, Estramustin HEXAL, Estramustina Filaxis, Estranovag, Multosin, Multosin Injekt, Proesta, Prostamustin, and Suloprost. === Availability === EMP is marketed in the United States, Canada, and Mexico under the brand name Emcyt, whereas the medication is marketed under the brand name Estracyt in the United Kingdom and elsewhere throughout Europe as well as in Argentina, Chile, and Hong Kong. It has been discontinued in a number of countries, including Australia, Brazil, Ireland, and Norway. == Research == EMP has been studied in the treatment of other cancers such as glioma and breast cancer. It has been found to slightly improve quality of life in people with glioma during the first 3 months of therapy. == References == == Further reading ==",

It is a white solid that is soluble in water. Like most natural amino acids, it is chiral, only the L-enantiomer occurs in nature, and it exists as the zwitterion at neutral pH. It is an intermediate in cysteine metabolism. It is not a coded amino acid, but is produced post-translationally. Peptides containing the cysteine sulfinic acid residue are substrates for cysteine sulfinic acid reductase. Cysteine sulfinic acid is derived from cysteine. Cysteine is formed from cystathionine via the cystathionine gamma-lyase enzyme, and is either broken down by cysteine lyase or cystathionine gamma-lyase or enters the cysteine sulfinic acid pathway where it is oxidized by cysteine dioxygenase to form cysteine sulfinic acid. Cysteine sulfinic acid, in turn, is decarboxylated by sulfinoalanine decarboxylase to form hypotaurine, which in turn is oxidized by hypotaurine dehydrogenase to yield taurine. Proteins containing this residue are found at the active site of some nitrile hydratases. == References ==",

         "Medical",
         "Tranylcypromine, sold under the brand name Parnate among others, is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). More specifically, tranylcypromine acts as nonselective and irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO). It is used as an antidepressant and anxiolytic agent in the clinical treatment of mood and anxiety disorders, respectively. It is also effective in the treatment of ADHD. Tranylcypromine is also known as trans-2-phenylcyclopropyl-1-amine and is formed pro forma from the cyclization of amphetamine's isopropylamine side chain. As a result, it is classified structurally as a substituted phenethylamine and amphetamine. == Medical uses == Tranylcypromine is used to treat major depressive disorder, including atypical depression, especially when there is an anxiety component, typically as a second-line treatment. It is also used in depression that is not responsive to reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, such as the SSRIs, TCAs, or bupropion. In addition to being a recognized treatment for major depressive disorder, tranylcypromine has been demonstrated to be effective in treating obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have reported that tranylcypromine is significantly more effective in the treatment of depression than placebo and has efficacy over placebo similar to that of other antidepressants such as tricyclic antidepressants. == Contraindications == Contraindications include: Porphyria Cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease Pheochromocytoma Tyramine, found in several foods, is metabolized by MAO. Ingestion and absorption of tyramine causes extensive release of norepinephrine, which can rapidly increase blood pressure to the point of causing hypertensive crisis. Concomitant use of serotonin-enhancing drugs, including SSRIs, serotonergic TCAs, dextromethorphan, and meperidine may cause serotonin syndrome. Concomitant use of MRAs, including fenfluramine, amphetamine, and pseudoephedrine may cause toxicity via serotonin syndrome or hypertensive crisis. L-DOPA given without carbidopa may cause hypertensive crisis. === Dietary restrictions === Tyramine is a biogenic amine produced as a (generally undesirable) byproduct during the fermentation of certain tyrosine-rich foods. It is rapidly metabolized by MAO-A in those not taking MAO-inhibiting drugs. Individuals sensitive to tyramine-induced hypertension may experience an uncomfortable, yet fleeting, increase in blood pressure after ingesting relatively small amounts of tyramine. Advances in food safety standards in most nations, as well as the widespread use of starter-cultures shown to result in undetectable to low levels of tyramine in fermented products has rendered concerns of serious hypertensive crises rare in those consuming a modern diet. Those treated with MAOIs should still exercise caution, particularly at home, if it is unclear whether food has been properly refrigerated. Since tyramine-producing microbes also produce compounds to which humans have a natural aversion, disposal of any questionable food—particularly meats—should be sufficient to avoid hypertensive crises. == Adverse effects == Incidence of adverse effects Very common (>10% incidence) adverse effects include: Dizziness secondary to orthostatic hypotension (17%) Common (1-10% incidence) adverse effects include: Tachycardia (5–10%) Hypomania (7%) Paresthesia (5%) Weight loss (2%) Confusion (2%) Dry mouth (2%) Sexual function disorders (2%) Hypertension (1–2 hours after ingestion) (2%) Rash (2%) Urinary retention (2%) Other (unknown incidence) adverse effects include: Increased/decreased appetite Blood dyscrasias Chest pain Diarrhea Edema Hallucinations Hyperreflexia Insomnia Jaundice Leg cramps Myalgia Palpitations Sensation of cold Suicidal ideation Tremor Of note, there has not been found to be a correlation between sex and age below 65 regarding incidence of adverse effects. Tranylcypromine is not associated with weight gain and has a low risk for hepatotoxicity compared to the hydrazine MAOIs. It is generally recommended that MAOIs be discontinued prior to anesthesia; however, this creates a risk of recurrent depression. In a retrospective observational cohort study, patients on tranylcypromine undergoing general anesthesia had a lower incidence of intraoperative hypotension, while there was no difference between patients not taking an MAOI regarding intraoperative incidence of bradycardia, tachycardia, or hypertension. The use of indirect sympathomimetic drugs or drugs affecting serotonin reuptake, such as meperidine or dextromethorphan poses a risk for hypertension and serotonin syndrome respectively; alternative agents are recommended. Other studies have come to similar conclusions. Pharmacokinetic interactions with anesthetics are unlikely, given that tranylcypromine is a high-affinity substrate for CYP2A6 and does not inhibit CYP enzymes at therapeutic concentrations. Tranylcypromine abuse has been reported at doses ranging from 120 to 600 mg per day. It is thought that higher doses have more amphetamine-like effects and abuse is promoted by the fast onset and short half-life of tranylcypromine. Cases of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during tranylcypromine therapy or early after treatment discontinuation. Symptoms of tranylcypromine overdose are generally more intense manifestations of its usual effects. == Interactions == In addition to contraindicated concomitant medications, tranylcypromine inhibits CYP2A6, which may reduce the metabolism and increase the toxicity of substrates of this enzyme, such as: Dexmedetomidine nicotine TSNAs (found in cured tobacco products, including cigarettes) Valproate Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors prevent neuronal uptake of tyramine and may reduce its pressor effects. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Tranylcypromine acts as a nonselective and irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase. Regarding the isoforms of monoamine oxidase, it shows slight preference for the MAOB isoenzyme over MAOA. This leads to an increase in the availability of monoamines, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, epinephrine as well as a marked increase in the availability of trace amines, such as tryptamine, octopamine, and phenethylamine. The clinical relevance of increased trace amine availability is unclear. It may also act as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor at higher therapeutic doses. Compared to amphetamine, tranylcypromine shows low potency as a dopamine releasing agent, with even weaker potency for norepinephrine and serotonin release. Tranylcypromine has also been shown to inhibit the histone demethylase, BHC110/LSD1. Tranylcypromine inhibits this enzyme with an IC50 < 2 μM, thus acting as a small molecule inhibitor of histone demethylation with an effect to derepress the transcriptional activity of BHC110/LSD1 target genes. The clinical relevance of this effect is unknown. Tranylcypromine has been found to inhibit CYP46A1 at nanomolar concentrations. The clinical relevance of this effect is unknown. === Pharmacokinetics === Tranylcypromine reaches its maximum concentration (tmax) within 1–2 hours. After a 20 mg dose, plasma concentrations reach at most 50-200 ng/mL. While its half-life is only about 2 hours, its pharmacodynamic effects last several days to weeks due to irreversible inhibition of MAO. Metabolites of tranylcypromine include 4-hydroxytranylcypromine, N-acetyltranylcypromine, and N-acetyl-4-hydroxytranylcypromine, which are less potent MAO inhibitors than tranylcypromine itself. Amphetamine was once thought to be a metabolite of tranylcypromine, but has not been shown to be. Tranylcypromine inhibits CYP2A6 at therapeutic concentrations. == Chemistry == === Synthesis === == History == Tranylcypromine was originally developed as an analog of amphetamine. Although it was first synthesized in 1948, its MAOI action was not discovered until 1959. Precisely because tranylcypromine was not, like isoniazid and iproniazid, a hydrazine derivative, its clinical interest increased enormously, as it was thought it might have a more acceptable therapeutic index than previous MAOIs. The drug was introduced by Smith, Kline and French in the United Kingdom in 1960, and approved in the United States in 1961. It was withdrawn from the market in February 1964 due to a number of patient deaths involving hypertensive crises with intracranial bleeding. However, it was reintroduced later that year with more limited indications and specific warnings of the risks. == Research == Tranylcypromine is known to inhibit LSD1, an enzyme that selectively demethylates two lysines found on histone H3. Genes promoted downstream of LSD1 are involved in cancer cell growth and metastasis, and several tumor cells express high levels of LSD1. Tranylcypromine analogues with more potent and selective LSD1 inhibitory activity are being researched in the potential treatment of cancers. Tranylcypromine may have neuroprotective properties applicable to the treatment of Parkinson's disease, similar to the MAO-B inhibitors selegiline and rasagiline. As of 2017, only one clinical trial in Parkinsonian patients has been conducted, which found some improvement initially and only slight worsening of symptoms after a 1.5 year followup. == See also == Tranylcypromine/trifluoperazine == References ==",

         "Ethionamide is an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis. Specifically it is used, along with other antituberculosis medications, to treat active multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. It is no longer recommended for leprosy. It is taken by mouth. Ethionamide has a high rate of side effects. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite. Serious side effects may include liver inflammation and depression. It should not be used in people with significant liver problems. Use in pregnancy is not recommended as safety is unclear. Ethionamide is in the thioamides family of medications. It is believed to work by interfering with the use of mycolic acid. Ethionamide was discovered in 1956 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1965. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Ethionamide is used in combination with other antituberculosis agents as part of a second-line regimen for active tuberculosis. Ethionamide is well absorbed orally with or without food, but is often administered with food to improve tolerance. It crosses the blood brain barrier to achieve concentrations in the cerebral-spinal fluid equivalent to plasma. The antimicrobial spectrum of ethionamide includes M. tuberculosis, M. bovis and M. smegmatis. It also is used rarely against infections with M. leprae and other nontuberculous mycobacteria such as M. avium and M. kansasii. While working in a similar manner to isoniazid, cross resistance is only seen in 13% of strains, since they are both prodrugs but activated by different pathways. Resistance can emerge from mutations in ethA, which is needed to activate the drug, or ethR, which can be overexpressed to repress ethA. Mutations in inhA or the promoter of inhA can also lead to resistance through changing the binding site or overexpression. The FDA has placed it in pregnancy category C, because it has caused birth defects in animal studies. It is not known whether ethionamide is excreted into breast milk. == Adverse effects == Ethionamide frequently causes gastrointestinal distress with nausea and vomiting which can lead patients to stop taking it. This can sometimes be improved by taking it with food. Ethionamide can cause hepatocellular toxicity and is contraindicated in patients with severe liver impairment. Patients on ethionamide should have regular monitoring of their liver function tests. Liver toxicity occurs in up to 5% of patients and follows a pattern similar to isoniazid, usually arising in the first 1 to 3 months of therapy, but can occur even after more than 6 months of therapy. The pattern of liver function test derangement is often a rise in the ALT and AST. Both central neurological side effects such as psychiatric disturbances and encephalopathy, along with peripheral neuropathy have been reported. Administering pyridoxine along with ethionamide may reduce these effects and is recommended. Ethionamide is structurally similar to methimazole, which is used to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis, and has been linked to hypothyroidism in several TB patients. Periodic monitoring of thyroid function while on ethionamide is recommended. === Interactions === Ethionamide may worsen the adverse effects of other antituberculous drugs being taken at the same time. It boosts levels of isoniazid when taken together and can lead to increased rates of peripheral neuropathy and hepatotoxicity. When taken with cycloserine, seizures have been reported. High rates of hepatotoxicty have been reported when taken with rifampicin. The drug's labeling cautions against excessive alcohol ingestion as it may provoke a psychotic reaction. == Mechanism of action == Ethionamide is a prodrug which is activated by the enzyme ethA, a mono-oxygenase in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and then binds NAD+ to form an adduct which inhibits InhA in the same way as isoniazid. The mechanism of action is thought to be through disruption of mycolic acid. Expression of the ethA gene is controlled by ethR, a transcriptional repressor. It is thought that improving ethA expression will increase the efficacy of ethionamide and prompting interest by drug developers in EthR inhibitors as a co-drug. == Other names == 1314 2-ethylisothionicotinamide amidazine thioamide iridocin It is sold under the brand name Trecator by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals which was purchased by Pfizer in 2009. == References == == External links == \"Ethionamide\".

         "Ethambutol (EMB, E) is a medication primarily used to treat tuberculosis. It is usually given in combination with other tuberculosis medications, such as isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide. It may also be used to treat Mycobacterium avium complex, and Mycobacterium kansasii. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include problems with vision, joint pain, nausea, headaches, and feeling tired. Other side effects include liver problems and allergic reactions. It is not recommended in people with optic neuritis, significant kidney problems, or under the age of five. Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding has not been found to cause harm. In the United States the FDA has raised concerns about eye issues in the baby if used during pregnancy. Ethambutol is believed to work by interfering with the bacteria's metabolism. Ethambutol was discovered in 1961. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines and is available as a generic medication. == Chirality and biological activity == (S,S)-(+)-Ethambutol is powerful and selective antitubercular drug. It is a typical example of an old drug that was introduced for clinical use in its unichiral form. Ethambutol contains two constitutionally symmetrical chiral centers in its structure and exists in three stereoisomeric forms, the enantiomeric pair (+)-(S,S)- and (−)-(R,R)-ethambutol, along with the achiral stereoisomer called meso-form. The (+)-(S,S)-enantiomer harbors the antitubercular activity. This enantiomer is 500 and 12 fold more potent than (−)-(R,R)-ethambutol and the meso-form respectively. On the other hand, all the three isomers are equipotent in terms of the major side-effect of the drug, optic neuritis. Toxicity is associated to both dose and duration of treatment. Hence the use of (S,S)-enantiomer greatly improved the risk/benefit balance. == Medical uses == Ethambutol is used along with other medications to treat a number of infections including: tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium complex, and Mycobacterium kansasii. == Adverse effects == Optic neuritis (hence contraindicated in children below six years of age) Red–green color blindness People taking ethambutol should be monitored for changes in visual acuity and color discrimination. Arthralgia Hyperuricaemia Vertical nystagmus Skin rash == Mechanism of action == Ethambutol is bacteriostatic against actively growing TB bacilli. It works by obstructing the formation of cell wall. Mycolic acids attach to the 5'-hydroxyl groups of D-arabinose residues of arabinogalactan and form mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex in the cell wall. It disrupts arabinogalactan synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme arabinosyl transferase. Disruption of the arabinogalactan synthesis inhibits the formation of this complex and leads to increased permeability of the cell wall. == Pharmacokinetics == It is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and well distributed in body tissues and fluids. 50% is excreted unchanged in urine. == References ==",

         "Medical",
         "Acamprosate, sold under the brand name Campral, is a medication which reduces alcoholism cravings. It is thought to stabilize chemical signaling in the brain that would otherwise be disrupted by alcohol withdrawal. When used alone, acamprosate is not an effective therapy for alcohol use disorder in most individuals, as it only addresses withdrawal symptoms and not psychological dependence. Acamprosate is a medication that works in the brain to treat alcohol use disorder. Acamprosate works by decreasing cravings and urges to use alcohol. This allows people who take the medication to control urges to drink and help to continue to not use alcohol. Acamprosate does not help with symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. It facilitates a reduction in alcohol consumption as well as full abstinence when used in combination with psychosocial support or other drugs that address the addictive behavior. Serious side effects include allergic reactions, abnormal heart rhythms, and low or high blood pressure, while less serious side effects include headaches, insomnia, and impotence. Diarrhea is the most common side-effect. It is unclear if use is safe during pregnancy. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Acamprosate is useful when used along with counseling in the treatment of alcohol use disorder. Over three to twelve months it increases the number of people who do not drink at all and the number of days without alcohol. It appears to work as well as naltrexone for maintenance of abstinence from alcohol, however naltrexone works slightly better for reducing alcohol cravings and heavy drinking, and acamprosate tends to work more poorly outside of Europe where treatment services are less robust. Difference in severity may also play a role. === Compliance === Some struggle to take the full course of medication (2 tablets, 3 times a day), which makes acamprosate less effective. Standard support to help people take their medication involves monthly check-ins with addiction services or a GP. Research found that compared to standard support alone, extra telephone support by a pharmacist, plus financial incentives, increased the numbers who took medication as prescribed and was cost-effective. The same telephone support without financial incentives did not significantly increase the numbers taking their medication as prescribed and was less cost-effective. == Contraindications == Acamprosate is primarily removed by the kidneys. A dose reduction is suggested in those with moderately impaired kidneys (creatinine clearance between 30 mL/min and 50 mL/min). It is also contraindicated in those who have a strong allergic reaction to acamprosate calcium or any of its components. == Adverse effects == The US label carries warnings about increases in suicidal behavior, major depressive disorder, and kidney failure. Adverse effects that caused people to stop taking the drug in clinical trials included diarrhea, nausea, depression, and anxiety. Potential adverse effects include headache, stomach pain, back pain, muscle pain, joint pain, chest pain, infections, flu-like symptoms, chills, heart palpitations, high blood pressure, fainting, vomiting, upset stomach, constipation, increased appetite, weight gain, edema, sleepiness, decreased sex drive, impotence, forgetfulness, abnormal thinking, abnormal vision, distorted sense of taste, tremors, runny nose, coughing, difficulty breathing, sore throat, bronchitis, and rashes. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === The pharmacodynamics of acamprosate are complex and not fully understood. Ethanol and benzodiazepines act on the central nervous system by binding to the GABAA receptor, increasing the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (i.e., they act as positive allosteric modulators at these receptors). In alcohol use disorder, one of the main mechanisms of tolerance is attributed to GABAA receptors becoming downregulated (i.e. these receptors become less sensitive to GABA). When alcohol is no longer consumed, these down-regulated GABAA receptor complexes are so insensitive to GABA that the typical amount of GABA produced has little effect, leading to physical withdrawal symptoms; since GABA normally inhibits neural firing, GABAA receptor desensitization results in unopposed excitatory neurotransmission (i.e., fewer inhibitory postsynaptic potentials occur through GABAA receptors), leading to neuronal over-excitation (i.e., more action potentials in the postsynaptic neuron). In addition, alcohol also inhibits the activity of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Chronic alcohol consumption leads to the overproduction (upregulation) of these receptors. Thereafter, sudden alcohol abstinence causes the excessive numbers of NMDARs to be more active than normal and to contribute to the symptoms of delirium tremens and excitotoxic neuronal death. Withdrawal from alcohol induces a surge in release of excitatory neurotransmitters like glutamate, which activates NMDARs. Acamprosate reduces this glutamate surge. The drug also protects cultured cells from excitotoxicity induced by ethanol withdrawal and from glutamate exposure combined with ethanol withdrawal. Although its ability to correct an overabundance of glutamate is well-established, the actual molecular target behind this action is poorly known. Knowledge on this topic has seen several major revisions. ==== GABA/NMDA hypothesis ==== It is originally believed to act as an NMDA receptor antagonist and positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors. Its activity on those receptors is indirect, unlike that of most other agents used in this context. An inhibition of the GABA-B system is believed to cause indirect enhancement of GABAA receptors. The effects on the NMDA complex are dose-dependent; the product appears to enhance receptor activation at low concentrations, while inhibiting it when consumed in higher amounts, which counters the excessive activation of NMDA receptors in the context of alcohol withdrawal. At high concentrations, well above those that occur clinically (1 μM to 3 μM), reports of inhibition of glutamate receptor-activated responses (1 mM), enhancement of NMDA receptor function (300 μM), weak antagonization of the NMDA receptor, and partial agonism of the polyamine site of the NMDA receptor. However, no direct action of acamprosate at clinically relevant concentrations has yet been reported. At clinical levels, any inhibiton of the NMDA receptor probably occurs in a allosteric way. One of acamprosate's purported mechanisms of action is the enhancement of GABA signaling at GABAA receptors via positive allosteric receptor modulation. It has been purported to open the chloride ion channel in a novel way as it does not require GABA as a cofactor, making it less liable for dependence than benzodiazepines. Acamprosate has been successfully used to control tinnitus, hyperacusis, ear pain, and inner ear pressure during alcohol use due to spasms of the tensor tympani muscle. ==== mGluR hypothesis ==== Two later hypothesized targets are mGluR1 and mGluR5 (10 μM). The idea originated from the fact that acamprosate blocked the neurotoxicity of an agonist of mGluR1 and mGluR5. However, a subsequent study found no action of acamprosate on the mGluR1 or mGluR5 at concentrations as high as 100 μM, nor at GABAA or glycine receptors or voltage-gated sodium channels. In addition, even if the 10 μM figure is correct, it would still be clinically irrelevant. ==== Calcium hypothesis ==== Spanagel et al. (2014) show that the effects of acamprosate calcium can mostly be attributed to the calcium component. Replacing calcium with sodium produces an inactive drug. Calcium chloride has a similar effect on glutamate neurotransmission. Moreover, calcium carbonate has a similar craving-reducing effect on human alcoholics. ==== Synergy hypothesis ==== Ademar et al. (2023) report that acamprosate sodium does, in fact, enhance the effect of calcium chloride in an animal alcoholism model, and hence is not a fully inactive molecule. They also show a role of increased dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbe downstream of the glycine receptor, partly mimicking ethanol. ==== Other effects ==== The product also increases the endogenous production of taurine. The substance also helps re-establish a standard sleep architecture by normalizing stage 3 and REM sleep phases, which is believed to be an important aspect of its pharmacological activity. === Pharmacokinetics === Acamprosate is not metabolized by the human body. Acamprosate's absolute bioavailability from oral administration is approximately 11%, and its bioavailability is decreased when taken with food. Following administration and absorption of acamprosate, it is excreted unchanged (i.e., as acamprosate) via the kidneys. Co-administration with naltrexone increases plasma levels. Its absorption and elimination are very slow, with a tmax of 6 hours and an elimination half life of over 30 hours. Steady-state levels are reached by day 5 of oral treatment. == History == Acamprosate was developed by Lipha, a subsidiary of Merck KGaA. and was approved for marketing in Europe in 1989. In October 2001 Forest Laboratories acquired the rights to market the drug in the US. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 2004. The first generic versions of acamprosate were launched in the US in 2013. As of 2015, acamprosate was in development by Confluence Pharmaceuticals as a potential treatment for fragile X syndrome. The drug was granted orphan drug designation for this use by the FDA in 2013, and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2014. == Society and culture == === Names === Acamprosate is the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) and the British Approved Name (BAN). Acamprosate calcium is the United States Adopted Name (USAN) and the Japanese Accepted Name (JAN). It is also technically known as N-acetylhomotaurine or as calcium acetylhomotaurinate. It is sold under the brand name Campral. == Research == In addition to its apparent ability to help people refrain from drinking, some evidence suggests that acamprosate is neuroprotective (that is, it protects neurons from damage and death caused by the effects of alcohol withdrawal, and possibly other causes of neurotoxicity). It has been tried for autism, both ideopathic and fragile X syndrome-linked. It appears to reduce amyloid-beta precursor protein levels. == References ==",

         "Food, Medical, Personal Care",
         "Aloin, also known as barbaloin, is a bitter, yellow-brown colored compound noted in the exudate of at least 68 Aloe species at levels from 0.1 to 6.6% of leaf dry weight (making between 3% and 35% of the total exudate), and in another 17 species at indeterminate levels [Reynolds, 1995b]. It is used as a stimulant-laxative, treating constipation by inducing bowel movements. The compound is present in what is commonly referred to as the aloe latex that exudes from cells adjacent to the vascular bundles, found under the rind of the leaf and in between it and the gel. When dried, it has been used as a bittering agent in commerce (alcoholic beverages) [21 CFR 172.510. Scientific names given include Aloe perryi, A. barbadensis (= A. vera), A. ferox, and hybrids of A. ferox with A. africana and A. spicata.]. Aloe is listed in federal regulations as a natural substance that may be \"safely used in food\" when used \"in the minimum quantity required to produce their intended physical or technical effect and in accordance with all the principles of good manufacturing practice.\" This food application is generally limited to use in quite small quantities as a flavoring in alcoholic beverages and may usually be identified only as a \"natural flavor.\" In May 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a ruling that aloe laxatives are no longer generally recognized as safe (GRAS) and effective, meaning that aloin-containing products are no longer available in over-the-counter drug products in the United States, because they may be carcinogenic and more data is needed to establish otherwise. Aloe vera leaf latex is a concentrate of an herb or other botanical, and so meets the statutory description of an ingredient that may be used in dietary supplements. == Structure and preparation == Aloin extracted from natural sources is a mixture of two diastereomers, termed aloin A (also called barbaloin) and aloin B (or isobarbaloin), which have similar chemical properties. Aloin is an anthraquinone glycosyl, meaning that its anthraquinone skeleton has been modified by the addition of a sugar molecule. Anthraquinones are a common family of naturally occurring yellow, orange, and red pigments of which many have cathartic properties, attributes shared by aloin. Aloin is related to aloe emodin, which lacks a sugar group but shares aloin's biological properties. Aloin is usually prepared by extraction from aloe latex (the term \"Cape aloe\" also refers to the dried latex of the leaves of several species of the genus Aloe, especially A. ferox [Blumenthal, 1998]), the bitter yellow exudate that seeps out from just underneath the skin of aloe leaves. The latex is then dried and powdered to make the final product, often made into tablets or a beverage, though aloin does not have good stability in aqueous solutions. Products derived from the gel of the aloe plant do not contain appreciable amounts of aloin, and have not been proven effective for any disease or condition when taken orally. == Effects == Once ingested, aloin increases peristaltic contractions in the colon, which induces bowel movements. Aloin also prevents the colon from re-absorbing water from the gastrointestinal tract, which leads to softer stools. This effect is caused by aloin's opening of chloride channels of the colonic membrane. In higher doses, these effects may lead to electrolyte imbalance, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, which are common side-effects of the drug. Because aloin can potentially cause uterine contractions, pregnant women should avoid ingesting aloe products containing aloin in more than trace amounts. In a study on consumption of aloe in rats and tilapia (with no separation of gel from aloin), significant negative health effects were found, including normocytic normochromic anaemia (low red blood cell count, but normal cells), hypoproteinaemia, and high AST levels. As many studies involving aloe gel (without aloin) have not observed these negative effects, it is possible that the negative effects could in large part be due to aloin. == Legal status == Plant-derived remedies containing aloin and other anthraquinones have been used as traditional medicines since antiquity, but harsh side effects make aloin generally unsuitable for household or daily use. In 2002, the US FDA mandated that manufacturers reformulate or stop manufacturing over-the-counter products containing aloe because the agency did not receive necessary safety data. The substance is still allowed in dietary supplements [21 U.S.C. 321 (ff)(1)] and is allowed for use in foods (primarily alcoholic beverages). == References == == External links == Aloin MSDS",

It is the dilactone of hexahydroxydiphenic acid. == Name == The name comes from the French term acide ellagique, from the word galle spelled backward because it can be obtained from noix de galle (galls), and to distinguish it from acide gallique (gallic acid). The molecule structure resembles to that of two gallic acid molecules being assembled \"head to tail\" and bound together by a C–C bond (as in biphenyl, or in diphenic acid) and two lactone links (cyclic carboxylic esters). == Metabolism == === Biosynthesis === Plants produce ellagic acid from hydrolysis of tannins such as ellagitannin and geraniin. === Biodegradation === Urolithins are gut flora human metabolites of dietary ellagic acid derivatives. Ellagic acid has low bioavailability, with 90% remaining unabsorbed from the intestines until metabolized by microflora to the more bioavailable urolithins. == History == Ellagic acid was first discovered by chemist Henri Braconnot in 1831. Maximilian Nierenstein prepared this substance from algarobilla, dividivi, oak bark, pomegranate, myrabolams, and valonea in 1905. He also suggested its formation from galloyl-glycine by Penicillium in 1915. Julius Löwe was the first person to synthesize ellagic acid by heating gallic acid with arsenic acid or silver oxide. == Natural occurrences == Ellagic acid is found in edible nuts. It is also found in oak species such as the North American white oak (Quercus alba) and European red oak (Quercus robur). The macrophyte Myriophyllum spicatum produces ellagic acid. Ellagic acid can be found in the medicinal mushroom Phellinus linteus. === In food === The highest levels of ellagic acid are found in raw chestnuts, walnuts, pecans, cranberries, raspberries, strawberries, and grapes, as well as distilled beverages. It is also found in peaches and pomegranates. == Research and health claims == Ellagic acid has been marketed as a dietary supplement with various claimed benefits against cancer, heart disease, and other diseases. In the 21st century, numerous U.S.-based supplement companies received FDA warning letters for promoting ellagic acid with false anti-disease claims that violate the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

It is mainly used for treatment of community acquired pneumonia. It is taken by mouth and is in the cephalosporin family of antibiotics, which is part of the broader beta-lactam group of antibiotics. == Structure == Like other cephalosporins, cefditoren has a β-lactam ring at the 7 position of cephalosporin ring that is responsible for its inhibitory action on bacterial cell wall synthesis. In addition to the cephem nucleus common to all cephalosporins, cefditoren has an aminothiazole group that enhances its activity against Gram-negative organisms, a methylthiazole group that enhances its activity against Gram-positive organisms, a methoxyimino group that gives it stability against β-lactamases, and a pivoxil ester group that enhances oral bioavailability. == Antimicrobial activity == The spectrum of cefditoren includes both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species. It has strong antimicrobial activity because of its high affinity for penicillin binding protein 2X, which responsible for cephalosporin resistance when mutated. Cefditoren pivoxil high intrinsic activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains. Cefditoren holds a balanced antimicrobial spectrum that includes the three major pathogens of community-acquired lower-respiratory tract infections: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Aerobic Gram-positive microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains, including β-lactamase-producing strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes Aerobic Gram-negative microorganisms: Haemophilus influenzae (including β-lactamase-producing strains), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (including β-lactamase-producing strains), Moraxella catarrhalis (including β-lactamase-producing strains. == Pharmacokinetics == === Absorption === Oral bioavailability: following oral administration, cefditoren pivoxil is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and hydrolyzed to cefditoren by esterases. Maximal plasma concentrations of cefditoren under fasting conditions average 1.8 ± 0.6 μg/mL following 200 mg dose and occur 1.5 to 3 hours following dosing. Cefditoren does not accumulate in plasma following twice daily administration to subjects with normal renal function. Under fasting conditions, the estimated absolute bioavailability of cefditoren pivoxil is approximately 14%. === Distribution === Binding of cefditoren to plasma proteins averages 88%, and the mean volume of distribution of cefditoren at steady state is 9.3L. Cefditoren has been shown to penetrate into bronchial mucosa, epithelial lining fluid, skin blister fluid and tonsillar tissue and clinically relevant concentrations against common pathogens are achieved in these tissues for at least 4 hours. === Metabolism and Excretion === Cefditoren is predominantly eliminated by the kidneys as unchanged drug and has a renal clearance of 4.1–5.6 L/h after multiple doses; its elimination half-life is 1.5 hours. == Medical uses == Cefditoren pivoxil is indicated to treat uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, community-acquired pneumonia, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, pharyngitis, and tonsillitis, acute maxillary sinusitis, otitis media (indications may differ in some countries). === Spectrum of bacterial susceptibility === Cefditoren pivoxil has a broad spectrum of activity and has been used to treat bacterial infections of the skin and respiratory tract, including bronchitis, pneumonia, and tonsillitis. The following represents minimum inhibitory concentration data for several medically significant microorganisms. Haemophilus influenzae: ≥0.063 – 0.25 μg/ml Staphylcoccus aureus: 0.25 – >128 μg/ml (not including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) Streptococcus pyogenes: ≤0.004 – 2 μg/ml Cefditoren does not have antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. == Dosage and administration == === Adults and Adolescents (≥12 Years) === Community-acquired pneumonia: 400 mg twice daily for 14 days Acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis: 400 mg twice daily for 10 days Pharyngitis/tonsillitis, otitis media, sinusitis: 200 mg twice daily for 10 days Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections: 200 mg twice daily for 10 days === Children (2 months to 12 years of age) === Pneumonia, otitis media or sinusitis: 3 mg/kg/dose, 3 times a day, after meals. The dosage may be increased up to 6 mg/kg/dose as needed, but not exceed the maximum dose for adults. For children with diseases other than above: 3 mg/kg/dose, 3 times a day after meals. The dosage may be adjusted according to the disease or the patients age and symptoms, but not exceed the maximum dose for adults. Safety in low birth weight infants and newborns has not been established. == Pregnancy == === Pregnancy Category B === Cefditoren pivoxil was not teratogenic up to the highest doses tested in rats and rabbits. In rats, this dose was 1000 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 24 times a human dose of 200 mg twice daily based on mg/m2/day. In rabbits, the highest dose tested was 90 mg/kg/day, which is approximately four times a human dose of 200 mg twice daily based on mg/m2/day. This dose produced severe maternal toxicity and resulted in fetal toxicity and abortions. In a postnatal development study in rats, cefditoren pivoxil produced no adverse effects on postnatal survival, physical and behavioral development, learning abilities, and reproductive capability at sexual maturity when tested at doses of up to 750 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested. This is approximately 18 times a human dose of 200 mg twice daily based on mg/m2/day. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. == Geriatric use == Of the 2675 patients in clinical studies who received cefditoren pivoxil 200 mg twice daily, 308 (12%) were >65 years of age. Of the 2159 patients in clinical studies who received cefditoren pivoxil 400 mg twice daily, 307 (14%) were >65 years of age. No clinically significant differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between older and younger patients. No dose adjustments are necessary in geriatric patients with normal renal function. This drug is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. == International approvals == Cefditoren pivoxil is available as 200 and 400 mg tablets in the United States. It was marketed under the trade name Spectracef by Vansen Pharma Inc. Cefditoren is also marketed under the name Meiact by Meiji Seika Pharma Co., Ltd. In India it is marketed under the brand name Zostum-O by Zuventus Healthcare. === Proprietary Preparations and Countries === US:Spectracef; India:Zostum-O; Japan:Meiact; Russia:Spectracef; China:Meiact; Greece:Spectracef; Indonesia:Meiact; Italy:Giasion; Mexico:Spectracef; Portugal:Meiact; Thailand:Meiact; Turkey: Cftiten, Meiact; Sefporin Spain: Spectracef, Meiact. == Contraindications == In patients with known allergy to the cephalosporin class of antibiotics or any of its components. Patients with carnitine deficiency or inborn errors of metabolism that may result in clinically significant carnitine deficiency, because use of cefditoren causes renal excretion of carnitine. == Safety and tolerability == Cefditoren pivoxil is generally well-tolerated, with most adverse events being of mild-to-moderate severity and self-limiting. Gastrointestinal adverse events (e.g., diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal pain) were the most commonly reported adverse events, although they seldom led to treatment discontinuation. In a post-marketing surveillance evaluating safety in 2006 children with acute otitis media treated with cefditoren (median daily dose: 10.0 mg/kg with a median total treatment period of 7 days), the incidence of adverse reactions was 1.79%, without unexpected or serious adverse drug reactions reported. The most frequent adverse drug reaction was diarrhea (1.30%) that resolved or subsided during treatment or after discontinuation or completion of therapy in all cases. Data from the clinical studies carried out with cefditoren in the treatment of pharyngotonsillitis from 2007 to 2010 in Japan showed that the percentage of adverse events was very low and diarrhea was the most frequent event. In the largest study (734 children), the incidence of adverse reactions was 1.50% (11 events in 11 patients), with 3 events of diarrhea and three of hematuria in urinalysis without clinical symptoms. In a study carried out in children in Thailand comparing cefditoren (66 patients) with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (72 patients) for 10 days in the treatment of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, the most frequent adverse event was diarrhea, with significant (P = 0.02) differences in the percentages found for both compounds (4.5% with cefditoren vs. 18.1% for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid). == Guidelines == === Japanese Guidelines === Japanese guidelines for the management of respiratory infectious diseases in children recommend cefditoren pivoxil as an initial antimicrobial therapy in children (2 months and older). === A panel of 70 pulmonologists, coordinated by 9 experts in respiratory care recommendations === A consensus on appropriate prescribing in lower respiratory tract infection therapy was appraised by Delphi exercise, based on a panel of 70 pulmonologists, coordinated by a scientific committee of nine experts in respiratory medical care. Amongst 3rd-generation oral cephalosporins, cefditoren pivoxil has the highest intrinsic activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin-resistant strains included. Amongst 3rd-generation oral cephalosporins, the spectrum of cefditoren is particularly balanced, includes both Gram-positive and Gram-negative species. The experts expressed the opinion that, due to its high intrinsic activity, cefditoren appears as an appropriate agent for either the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections and for parenteral to oral switch therapy as well. == Ideal for switch therapy == The characteristics of oral antibiotics to be considered for the switch therapy (parenteral to oral antibiotic) are: (i) similar antimicrobial spectrum, (ii) high bioavailability, (iii) administration time 12–24 hours, (iv) good tolerability The expert panel reached a high level of consensus on cefditoren pivoxil as the most appropriate option for the switch therapy from parenteral third-generation cephalosporins (like cefotaxime or ceftriaxone) to oral therapy, because of the similar spectrum and the highest intrinsic activity. == References == == External links == Drug Approval Package Manufacturer's Product website Manufacturer's prescribing information for Spectracef",

         "Endogenous, Medical, Personal Care",
         "Lipoic acid (LA), also known as α-lipoic acid, alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) and thioctic acid, is an organosulfur compound derived from caprylic acid (octanoic acid). ALA, which is made in animals normally, is essential for aerobic metabolism. It is also available as a dietary supplement or pharmaceutical drug in some countries. Lipoate is the conjugate base of lipoic acid, and the most prevalent form of LA under physiological conditions. Only the (R)-(+)-enantiomer (RLA) exists in nature. RLA is an essential cofactor of many processes. == Physical and chemical properties == Lipoic acid contains two sulfur atoms connected by a disulfide bond in the 1,2-dithiolane ring. It also carries a carboxylic acid group. It is considered to be oxidized relative to its acyclic relative dihydrolipoic acid, in which each sulfur exists as a thiol. It is a yellow solid. (R)-(+)-lipoic acid (RLA) occurs naturally, but (S)-(-)-lipoic acid (SLA) has been synthesized. For use in dietary supplement materials and compounding pharmacies, the USP established an official monograph for R/S-LA. == Biological function == Lipoic acid is a cofactor for five enzymes or classes of enzymes: pyruvate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, the glycine cleavage system, branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase, and the α-oxo(keto)adipate dehydrogenase. The first two are critical to the citric acid cycle. The GCS regulates glycine concentrations. HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC6, HDAC8, and HDAC10 are targets of the reduced form (open dithiol) of (R)-lipoic acid. === Biosynthesis and attachment === Most endogenously produced RLA are not \"free\" because octanoic acid, the precursor to RLA, is bound to the enzyme complexes prior to enzymatic insertion of the sulfur atoms. As a cofactor, RLA is covalently attached by an amide bond to a terminal lysine residue of the enzyme's lipoyl domains. The precursor to lipoic acid, octanoic acid, is made via fatty acid biosynthesis in the form of octanoyl-acyl carrier protein. In eukaryotes, a second fatty acid biosynthetic pathway in mitochondria is used for this purpose. The octanoate is transferred as a thioester of acyl carrier protein from fatty acid biosynthesis to an amide of the lipoyl domain protein by an enzyme called an octanoyltransferase. Two hydrogens of octanoate are replaced with sulfur groups via a radical SAM mechanism, by lipoyl synthase. As a result, lipoic acid is synthesized attached to proteins and no free lipoic acid is produced. Lipoic acid can be removed whenever proteins are degraded and by action of the enzyme lipoamidase. Free lipoate can be used by some organisms as an enzyme called lipoate protein ligase that attaches it covalently to the correct protein. The ligase activity of this enzyme requires ATP. === Cellular transport === Along with sodium and the vitamins biotin (B7) and pantothenic acid (B5), lipoic acid enters cells through the SMVT (sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter). Each of the compounds transported by the SMVT is competitive with the others. For example research has shown that increasing intake of lipoic acid or pantothenic acid reduces the uptake of biotin and/or the activities of biotin-dependent enzymes. === Enzymatic activity === Lipoic acid is a cofactor for at least five enzyme systems. Two of these are in the citric acid cycle through which many organisms turn nutrients into energy. Lipoylated enzymes have lipoic acid attached to them covalently. The lipoyl group transfers acyl groups in 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes, and methylamine group in the glycine cleavage complex or glycine dehydrogenase. Lipoic acid is the cofactor of the following enzymes in humans: The most-studied of these is the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. These complexes have three central subunits: E1-3, which are the decarboxylase, lipoyl transferase, and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, respectively. These complexes have a central E2 core and the other subunits surround this core to form the complex. In the gap between these two subunits, the lipoyl domain ferries intermediates between the active sites. The lipoyl domain itself is attached by a flexible linker to the E2 core and the number of lipoyl domains varies from one to three for a given organism. The number of domains has been experimentally varied and seems to have little effect on growth until over nine are added, although more than three decreased activity of the complex. Lipoic acid serves as co-factor to the acetoin dehydrogenase complex catalyzing the conversion of acetoin (3-hydroxy-2-butanone) to acetaldehyde and acetyl coenzyme A. The glycine cleavage system differs from the other complexes, and has a different nomenclature. In this system, the H protein is a free lipoyl domain with additional helices, the L protein is a dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, the P protein is the decarboxylase, and the T protein transfers the methylamine from lipoate to tetrahydrofolate (THF) yielding methylene-THF and ammonia. Methylene-THF is then used by serine hydroxymethyltransferase to synthesize serine from glycine. This system is part of plant photorespiration. === Biological sources and degradation === Lipoic acid is present in many foods in which it is bound to lysine in proteins, but slightly more so in kidney, heart, liver, spinach, broccoli, and yeast extract. Naturally occurring lipoic acid is always covalently bound and not readily available from dietary sources. In addition, the amount of lipoic acid present in dietary sources is low. For instance, the purification of lipoic acid to determine its structure used an estimated 10 tons of liver residue, which yielded 30 mg of lipoic acid. As a result, all lipoic acid available as a supplement is chemically synthesized. Baseline levels (prior to supplementation) of RLA and R-DHLA have not been detected in human plasma. RLA has been detected at 12.3−43.1 ng/mL following acid hydrolysis, which releases protein-bound lipoic acid. Enzymatic hydrolysis of protein bound lipoic acid released 1.4−11.6 ng/mL and <1-38.2 ng/mL using subtilisin and alcalase, respectively. Digestive proteolytic enzymes cleave the R-lipoyllysine residue from the mitochondrial enzyme complexes derived from food but are unable to cleave the lipoic acid-L-lysine amide bond. Both synthetic lipoamide and (R)-lipoyl-L-lysine are rapidly cleaved by serum lipoamidases, which release free (R)-lipoic acid and either L-lysine or ammonia. Little is known about the degradation and utilization of aliphatic sulfides such as lipoic acid, except for cysteine. Lipoic acid is metabolized in a variety of ways when given as a dietary supplement in mammals. Degradation to tetranorlipoic acid, oxidation of one or both of the sulfur atoms to the sulfoxide, and S-methylation of the sulfide were observed. Conjugation of unmodified lipoic acid to glycine was detected especially in mice. Degradation of lipoic acid is similar in humans, although it is not clear if the sulfur atoms become significantly oxidized. Apparently mammals are not capable of utilizing lipoic acid as a sulfur source. == Diseases == === Combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA) === In the metabolic disease combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA) due to ACSF3 deficiency, mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFASII), which is the precursor reaction of lipoic acid biosynthesis, is impaired. The result is a reduced lipoylation degree of important mitochondrial enzymes, such as pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (α-KGDHC). Supplementation with lipoic acid does not restore mitochondrial function. == Chemical synthesis == SLA did not exist prior to chemical synthesis in 1952. SLA is produced in equal amounts with RLA during achiral manufacturing processes. The racemic form was more widely used clinically in Europe and Japan in the 1950s to 1960s despite the early recognition that the various forms of LA are not bioequivalent. The first synthetic procedures appeared for RLA and SLA in the mid-1950s. Advances in chiral chemistry led to more efficient technologies for manufacturing the single enantiomers by both classical resolution and asymmetric synthesis and the demand for RLA also grew at this time. In the 21st century, R/S-LA, RLA and SLA with high chemical and/or optical purities are available in industrial quantities. At the current time, most of the world supply of R/S-LA and RLA is manufactured in China and smaller amounts in Italy, Germany, and Japan. RLA is produced by modifications of a process first described by Georg Lang in a Ph.D. thesis and later patented by DeGussa. Although RLA is favored nutritionally due to its \"vitamin-like\" role in metabolism, both RLA and R/S-LA are widely available as dietary supplements. Both stereospecific and non-stereospecific reactions are known to occur in vivo and contribute to the mechanisms of action, but evidence to date indicates RLA may be the eutomer (the nutritionally and therapeutically preferred form). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacokinetics === A 2007 human pharmacokinetic study of sodium RLA demonstrated the maximum concentration in plasma and bioavailability are significantly greater than the free acid form, and rivals plasma levels achieved by intravenous administration of the free acid form. Additionally, high plasma levels comparable to those in animal models where Nrf2 was activated were achieved. The various forms of LA are not bioequivalent. Very few studies compare individual enantiomers with racemic lipoic acid. It is unclear if twice as much racemic lipoic acid can replace RLA. The toxic dose of LA in cats is much lower than that in humans or dogs and produces hepatocellular toxicity. === Pharmacodynamics === The mechanism and action of lipoic acid when supplied externally to an organism is controversial. Lipoic acid in a cell seems primarily to induce the oxidative stress response rather than directly scavenge free radicals. This effect is specific for RLA. Despite the strongly reducing milieu, LA has been detected intracellularly in both oxidized and reduced forms. LA is able to scavenge reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species in a biochemical assay due to long incubation times, but there is little evidence this occurs within a cell or that radical scavenging contributes to the primary mechanisms of action of LA. The relatively good scavenging activity of LA toward hypochlorous acid (a bactericidal produced by neutrophils that may produce inflammation and tissue damage) is due to the strained conformation of the 5-membered dithiolane ring, which is lost upon reduction to DHLA. In cells, LA is reduced to dihydrolipoic acid, which is generally regarded as the more bioactive form of LA and the form responsible for most of the antioxidant effects and for lowering the redox activities of unbound iron and copper. This theory has been challenged due to the high level of reactivity of the two free sulfhydryls, low intracellular concentrations of DHLA as well as the rapid methylation of one or both sulfhydryls, rapid side-chain oxidation to shorter metabolites and rapid efflux from the cell. Although both DHLA and LA have been found inside cells after administration, most intracellular DHLA probably exists as mixed disulfides with various cysteine residues from cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins. Recent findings suggest therapeutic and anti-aging effects are due to modulation of signal transduction and gene transcription, which improve the antioxidant status of the cell. However, this likely occurs via pro-oxidant mechanisms, not by radical scavenging or reducing effects. All the disulfide forms of LA (R/S-LA, RLA and SLA) can be reduced to DHLA although both tissue specific and stereoselective (preference for one enantiomer over the other) reductions have been reported in model systems. At least two cytosolic enzymes, glutathione reductase (GR) and thioredoxin reductase (Trx1), and two mitochondrial enzymes, lipoamide dehydrogenase and thioredoxin reductase (Trx2), reduce LA. SLA is stereoselectively reduced by cytosolic GR whereas Trx1, Trx2 and lipoamide dehydrogenase stereoselectively reduce RLA. (R)-(+)-lipoic acid is enzymatically or chemically reduced to (R)-(-)-dihydrolipoic acid whereas (S)-(-)-lipoic acid is reduced to (S)-(+)-dihydrolipoic acid. Dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) can also form intracellularly and extracellularly via non-enzymatic, thiol-disulfide exchange reactions. RLA may function in vivo like a B-vitamin and at higher doses like plant-derived nutrients, such as curcumin, sulforaphane, resveratrol, and other nutritional substances that induce phase II detoxification enzymes, thus acting as cytoprotective agents. This stress response indirectly improves the antioxidant capacity of the cell. The (S)-enantiomer of LA was shown to be toxic when administered to thiamine-deficient rats. Several studies have demonstrated that SLA either has lower activity than RLA or interferes with the specific effects of RLA by competitive inhibition. == Uses == R/S-LA and RLA are widely available as over-the-counter nutritional supplements in the United States in the form of capsules, tablets, and aqueous liquids, and have been marketed as antioxidants and pertaining to cellular glucose utilization for metabolic disorders and type 2 diabetes. Although the body can synthesize LA, it can also be absorbed from the diet. Dietary supplementation in doses from 200–600 mg is likely to provide up to 1000 times the amount available from a regular diet. Gastrointestinal absorption is variable and decreases with the use of food. It is therefore recommended that dietary LA be taken 30–60 minutes before or at least 120 minutes after a meal. Maximum blood levels of LA are achieved 30–60 minutes after dietary supplementation, and it is thought to be largely metabolized in the liver. In Germany, LA is approved as a drug for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy since 1966 and is available as a non-prescription pharmaceutical. == Clinical research == According to the American Cancer Society as of 2013, \"there is no reliable scientific evidence at this time that lipoic acid prevents the development or spread of cancer\". As of 2015, intravenously administered ALA is unapproved anywhere in the world except Germany for diabetic neuropathy, but has been proven reasonably safe and effective. As of 2012, there was no good evidence alpha lipoic acid helps people with mitochondrial disorders. A 2018 review recommended ALA as an anti-obesity supplement with low dosage (< 600 mg/day) for a short period (<10 weeks). == Other lipoic acids == β-lipoic acid is a thiosulfinate of α-lipoic acid == See also == Aminolevulinic acid == References == == External links == Media related to Lipoic acid at Wikimedia Commons",

         "Food, Medical",
         "Isoleucine (symbol Ile or I) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH+3 form under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated −COO− form under biological conditions), and a hydrocarbon side chain with a branch (a central carbon atom bound to three other carbon atoms). It is classified as a non-polar, uncharged (at physiological pH), branched-chain, aliphatic amino acid. It is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it. Essential amino acids are necessary in the human diet. In plants isoleucine can be synthesized from threonine and methionine. In plants and bacteria, isoleucine is synthesized from a pyruvate employing leucine biosynthesis enzymes. It is encoded by the codons AUU, AUC, and AUA. == Metabolism == === Biosynthesis === In plants and microorganisms, isoleucine is synthesized from pyruvate and alpha-ketobutyrate. This pathway is not present in humans. Enzymes involved in this biosynthesis include: Acetolactate synthase (also known as acetohydroxy acid synthase) Acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase Dihydroxyacid dehydratase Valine aminotransferase === Catabolism === Isoleucine is both a glucogenic and a ketogenic amino acid. After transamination with alpha-ketoglutarate, the carbon skeleton is oxidised and split into propionyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA. Propionyl-CoA is converted into succinyl-CoA, a TCA cycle intermediate which can be converted into oxaloacetate for gluconeogenesis (hence glucogenic). In mammals acetyl-CoA cannot be converted to carbohydrate but can be either fed into the TCA cycle by condensing with oxaloacetate to form citrate or used in the synthesis of ketone bodies (hence ketogenic) or fatty acids. === Metabolic diseases === The degradation of isoleucine is impaired in the following metabolic diseases: Combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA) Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) Methylmalonic acidemia Propionic acidemia === Insulin resistance === Isoleucine, like other branched-chain amino acids, is associated with insulin resistance: higher levels of isoleucine are observed in the blood of diabetic mice, rats, and humans. In diet-induced obese and insulin resistant mice, a diet with decreased levels of isoleucine (with or without the other branched-chain amino acids) results in reduced adiposity and improved insulin sensitivity. Reduced dietary levels of isoleucine are required for the beneficial metabolic effects of a low protein diet. In humans, a protein restricted diet lowers blood levels of isoleucine and decreases fasting blood glucose levels. Mice fed a low isoleucine diet are leaner, live longer, and are less frail. In humans, higher dietary levels of isoleucine are associated with greater body mass index. == Functions and requirement == The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the U.S. Institute of Medicine has set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for essential amino acids in 2002. For adults 19 years and older, 19 mg of isoleucine/kg body weight is required daily. Beside its biological role as a nutrient, isoleucine also participates in regulation of glucose metabolism. Isoleucine is an essential component of many proteins. As an essential amino acid, isoleucine must be ingested or protein production in the cell will be disrupted. Fetal hemoglobin is one of the many proteins that require isoleucine. Isoleucine is present in the gamma chain of fetal hemoglobin and must be present for the protein to form. Genetic diseases can change the consumption requirements of isoleucine. Amino acids cannot be stored in the body. Buildup of excess amino acids will cause a buildup of toxic molecules so, humans have many pathways to degrade each amino acid when the need for protein synthesis has been met. Mutations in isoleucine-degrading enzymes can lead to dangerous buildup of isoleucine and its toxic derivative. One example is maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), a disorder that leaves people unable to breakdown isoleucine, valine, and leucine. People with MSUD manage their disease by a reduced intake of all three of those amino acids alongside drugs that help excrete built-up toxins. Many animals and plants are dietary sources of isoleucine as a component of proteins. Foods that have high amounts of isoleucine include eggs, soy protein, seaweed, turkey, chicken, lamb, cheese, and fish. == Synthesis == Routes to isoleucine are numerous. One common multistep procedure starts from 2-bromobutane and diethylmalonate. Synthetic isoleucine was first reported in 1905 by French chemists Bouveault and Locquin. == Discovery == German chemist Felix Ehrlich discovered isoleucine while studying the composition of beet-sugar molasses 1903. In 1907 Ehrlich carried out further studies on fibrin, egg albumin, gluten, and beef muscle in 1907. These studies verified the natural composition of isoleucine. Ehrlich published his own synthesis of isoleucine in 1908. == See also == Alloisoleucine, the diasteromer of isoleucine Low Isoleucine protein foods == References == == External links == Isoleucine degradation Isoleucine biosynthesis",

         "Palbociclib, sold under the brand name Ibrance among others, is a medication developed by Pfizer for the treatment of HR-positive and HER2-negative breast cancer. It is a selective inhibitor of the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6. Palbociclib was the first CDK4/6 inhibitor to be approved as a cancer therapy. == Mechanism of action == It is a selective inhibitor of the cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6. In the G1 phase of the cell cycle, mammalian cells must pass a checkpoint, known as the restriction point \"R\", in order to complete the cell cycle and divide. CDK4 and CDK6 complex with Cyclin D drive the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein, Rb, which allows the cell to pass R and commit to division. Regulation of one or more proteins involved in this checkpoint is lost in many cancers. However, by inhibiting CDK4/6, palbociclib ensures that the cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex cannot aid in phosphorylating Rb. This prevents the cell from passing R and exiting G1, and in turn from proceeding through the cell cycle. == Administration == Palbociclib is taken daily orally with food in a cycle of 21 days of active medication, followed by a week of abstinence. Currently, palbociclib is prescribed as a combination therapy with either letrozole or fulvestrant. Patients should also not consume CYP3A inhibitors or inducers while taking palbociclib. FDA information also cautions against consuming grapefruit products while taking palbociclib, in order to avoid negative interactions. == Approvals and indications == === HR+ breast cancer === The drug was reviewed and approved under the Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) accelerated Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designation programs on February 3, 2015, as a treatment (in combination with letrozole) for patients with estrogen receptor positive (ER+) advanced breast cancer. This was an accelerated approval. In March 2017, the FDA granted regular approval to palbociclib for hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative advanced or metastatic breast cancer, in combination with an aromatase inhibitor. A phase III trial, PALOMA-2, was fully enrolled by February 2015 and reported positive results in April 2016. The results of PALOMA-2 trial, published in November 2016, showed significantly longer progression-free survival in patients on palbociclib in combination with letrozole, compared to patients on letrozole and placebo. Progression-free survival was assessed by radiologically-confirmed disease progression by RECIST criteria or death during the study. At the time of publication, there was insufficient data on overall survival, and a final analysis is planned after a total of 390 deaths occur per protocol and in agreement with regulatory agencies. Of note, it was noted that the addition of palbociclib caused higher rates of myelotoxic events in the study. The drug was approved for use in the European Union in November 2016 as a treatment for hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer, either in combination with an aromatase inhibitor or, for women who have received prior endocrine therapy, in combination with fulvestrant. In pre- or perimenopausal women, a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist should also be given. In December 2017, palbociclib, was accepted for use by the NHS after going through the Scottish Medicines Consortium's process for medicines used to treat very rare and end-of-life breast cancer. == Adverse effects == A majority of patients taking palbociclib experience neutropenia, a condition where a patient has an abnormally low number of neutrophils. This side effect impacts the immune system, and is thus likely responsible for the second most common side effect, infection. Leukopenia and anemia are also frequent among patients taking palbociclib. More than 10% of patients also experience side effects such as fatigue, nausea, diarrhea, respiratory infection, headache, thrombocytopenia, vomiting, and decreased appetite. The FDA also indicates that patients should be vigilant to monitor themselves for any sign of pulmonary embolism. The FDA further cautions that women should be aware that the medication can have a harmful effect on a fetus, and thus should not be taken while pregnant. == Mechanisms of resistance == === Resistance to palbociclib === FDA- and EMA-approval for palbociclib hinges upon the clinical trials’ results regarding progression-free survival (PFS). However, though data has proven promising (one study had p-values very close to the significance threshold which, with further clinical trials, may be able to demonstrate statistical significance), there is as of 2019 no significant improvement evident in overall survival (OS) when taking palbociclib. For example, in the PALOMA-2 trial, more than 70% of patients who were treated with palbociclib and letrozole progressed by 40 months. This has impeded the drug's worldwide acceptance as economic analyses have not found palbociclib to be cost-effective. === De novo resistance === De novo resistance to palbociclib implicates a variety of targets both upstream and downstream of the CDK4/6 to Rb pathway. Overexpression of the transcription factor E2F2 is capable of promoting resistance to CDK4/6 inhibition more than just loss of Rb alone (the direct downstream target of CDK4/6). Palbociclib is less effective in patients whose breast cancer cells overexpress cyclin E1 or E2, and Brk (breast tumor-related kinase). Brk is an intracellular kinase that is overexpressed in 60% of breast cancers and whose amplification leads to increased phosphorylation of Y88 of the p27 protein, as well as increases the cyclin D and CDK4 activity, thereby rendering the cancer cells more resistant to palbociclib. A 2018 study found that mutations in a pathway completely unrelated to the CDK4/6-Rb axis are also implicated in resistance to palbociclib. Loss of the FAT1 tumor suppressor promoted resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors through the Hippo pathway, a signaling pathway known to function as a tumor suppressor. Previously, FAT1 had been suggested to be a tumor suppressor and oncogene, though never before explicitly linked to resistance. The team found that FAT1 suppressed cells required significantly higher doses of CDK4/6 inhibitors in order to block proliferation of breast cancer cells in vivo. === Resistance due to endocrine therapy === Palbociclib is indicated in HR+, HER2- metastatic breast cancer cells. Because CDK4/6 inhibition acts directly downstream of the endocrine therapy targets, cross-therapy resistance could possibly develop as a result of patient progression on hormone-therapy. In general, however, endocrine-resistant tumors are able to maintain sensitivity to CDK4/6 inhibition, with particular success witnessed with patients given combination therapy of palbociclib with endocrine therapy. For example, the PALOMA-3 trial which studied the benefit of palbociclib and fulvestrant vs. fulvestrant alone found that the combined treatment regimen improved PFS in both patients with an ESR1 mutation and those with ESR1 wildtype ctDNA. Such results indicate that CDK4/6 inhibitors are effective irrespective of ESR1 mutation status, a marker that otherwise would reveal a patient to be endocrine-resistant. Certain manifestations of endocrine therapy resistance may further sensitize the breast cancer to CDK4/6 inhibitors. For example, deficiencies in mismatch repair caused by the MutL mutation in ER+ breast cancer evades CHK2-mediated inhibition of CDK4, thereby leading to endocrine resistance. CDK4/6 inhibitors, however, have been demonstrated to be highly effective in MutL-defective ER+ breast cancer cells, and MutL bears potential as a biomarker for identifying patients highly suitable for treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors. === Other mechanisms of resistance === Researchers at the Dana Farber Institute found that breast cancer cells that developed resistance to palbociclib were resensitized to the drug after a seven-day \"treatment holiday\". Scientists linked the initial development of resistance to an increase in expression of CDK6 (but not CDK4, the other target of palbociclib), with the specific mechanism of CDK6 upregulation originating from suppression of the TGF-β pathway via the miR-432-5p microRNA. Scientists made this discovery after noticing that, in the lab, all breast cancer cells in the dish were found to acquire resistance at a similar time, a phenomenon contrary to classical models of acquiring resistance in which one or two cells become resistant and then expand to encompass more of the tumor as they divide. These palbociclib-resistance cells also did not contain a particular mutation, but rather became resistant via and continued to spread this resistance to neighboring cells via exosomes. While the mechanism of this resistance has not yet been elucidated, it opens an avenue for further research into a completely novel method through which cancer cells acquire resistance. On the other hand, this suggests that patients which seemingly progress on palbociclib could benefit from longer-term treatment following a treatment holiday in which their tumors are \"reset\". There are a variety of means through which cancer cells become resistant to palbociclib, with mechanisms of resistance involving multiple targets and processes throughout the pathway in which palbociclib operates. Previous research estimates that breast cancer cells show adaptation against palbociclib as early as 72 hours post-treatment. Evidence for this was \"shown to be mediated by non-canonical activation of cyclin D1/CDK2 complexes, which in turn induced a recovery of cyclin E2 expression and [subsequent] S-phase entry despite CDK4/6 inhibition\" upstream of these two targets. Furthermore, it is estimated that approximately 10% of patients have primary resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors (resistance prior to drug therapy). For example, patients who display evidence of functional Rb loss at baseline are not likely to benefit from CDK4/6 inhibition, nor are patients who display baseline evidence of increased cyclin E1 expression, or a high CCNE1/RB ratio. == Clinical trials == === HR+ breast cancer === The PALOMA-3 trial announced in April 2015 that the addition of palbociclib was superior to fulvestrant alone for progression-free survival. In the phase II PALOMA-1 trial reported at the April 2014 annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research, the addition of palbociclib to letrozole was shown to significantly slow the progression of advanced cancer (median progression-free survival increased from 10.2 months to 20.2 months), but was not shown to have a statistically significant effect on increasing patients' overall survival times. Pfizer announce on May 31, 2020, the results of a preplanned efficacy and futility analysis. The results indicate that, when used in combination with post-surgery endocrine therapy, it \"is unlikely to show a statistically significant improvement in the primary endpoint of invasive disease-free survival (iDFS).\" The trial was conducted on male and female patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative early stage breast cancer. === Active clinical trials === According to the NIH National Cancer Institute there are currently 39 active clinical trials testing palbociclib on its own or in combination with other medications. While a majority of these are exploring the further uses of palbociclib to treat breast cancer, other trials are investigating the potential applications of palbociclib to head and neck cancers, non-small cell lung cancer, recurring brain metastasis, squamous cell carcinoma, central nervous system tumors, and other solid tumor types. In December 2017, Pfizer announced that the PALOMA-2 trial, an ongoing phase III trial combining palbociclib with letrozole, showed a 44% reduction in risk of disease progression among trial subjects. The trial has also demonstrated greater than a year's improved median progression free survival for patients on the combined therapy (as compared to letrozole on its own). PALOMA-2 median patient follow-up time now exceeds three years, making it the longest traceable data for phase III study of a CDK4/6 inhibitor. Palbociclib is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials as a combination treatment with oral SERD’s for ER+/HER2- breast cancer. Studies include palbociclib plus G1 Therapeutic’s rintodestrant and Zentalis’s Zn-c5. == Drugs with a similar mechanism of action == Palbociclib has several direct competitors currently on the market or in clinical trials. In September 2017, abemaciclib, another selective CDK4/6 inhibitor owned and manufactured by Eli Lilly, was approved for HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced metastatic breast cancer both in combination with fulvestrant and as a monotherapy. In March 2017, the FDA also approved ribociclib, owned by Novartis, as a combination therapy with aromatase inhibitors for indications similar to those of palbociclib and ribociclib. Notably, ribociclib seems to also have an inhibitory effect on Cyclin D3/CDK6 activity. G1 Therapeutics also has a CDK4/6 inhibitor, trilaciclib, which is up for FDA approval (target decision date of February 15, 2021) for use in small cell lung cancer. == Society and culture == === Economics === Palbociclib (Ibrance) \"can be ordered through select\" specialty pharmacies and \"sells for $9,850 for 30 days or $118,200 for a year's supply before discounts.\" According to a statement by the New York–based Pfizer the price \"is not the cost that most patients or payors pay\" since most prescriptions are dispensed through health plans, which negotiate discounts for medicines or get government-mandated price concessions. In the United States specialty pharmacies fill prescriptions for drugs that are usually high cost. Pfizer reported revenue of US$4.753 billion for Ibrance in 2023. ==== Resistance to cost ==== In February 2017, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the United Kingdom published a statement stating that the cost of Ibrance (approximately US$3700/28 days) did not make the added health benefits worth the cost. It was stated that with the side effects caused by Ibrance, it was not a cost-effective medication for NICE to endorse. At the time, a year's treatment with palbociclib and a drug such as fulvestrant was priced at US$106,105 (£79,650). In November 2017 NICE announced that, after negotiation with Pfizer, the price would be discounted, and the drug would be recommended for use. == References ==",

         " Encequidar, a gut-specific P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitor, makes oral paclitaxel possible, and has been used in clinical treatment of metastatic breast cancer, however, its pharmacological effect and mechanism of reversal of drug resistance in drug-resistant colon cancer cells SW620/AD300 are still unknown. Herein, we first synthesized encequidar and demonstrated that it could inhibit the transport activity of P-gp, reduced doxorubicin (DOX) efflux, enhanced DOX cytotoxicity and promoted tumor-apoptosis in SW620/AD300 cells. Metabolomic analysis of cell samples was performedusing liquid chromatography Q-Exactive mass spectrometer, the results of metabolite enrichment analysis and pathway analysis showed that the combination of encequidar and DOX could: i) significantly affect the citric acid cycle (TCA cycle) and reduce the energy supply required for P-gp to exert its transport activity; ii) affect the metabolism of glutathione, which is the main component of the anti-oxidative stress system, and reduce the ability of cells to resist oxidative stress; iii) increase the intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and enhance ROS-induced cell damage and lipid peroxidation, which in turn restore the sensitivity of drug-resistant cells to DOX. In conclusion, these results provide sufficient data support for the therapeutical application of the P-gp inhibitor encequidar to reverse MDR, and are of great significance to further understand the therapeutic advantages of encequidar in anti-tumor therapy and guide clinical rational drug use. Oraxol is an oral formulation of paclitaxel administered with a novel, minimally absorbed P-glycoprotein inhibitor encequidar (HM30181A). This phase Ib study was conducted to determine the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of Oraxol administered at a fixed dose for up to 5 consecutive days in patients with advanced malignancies. Part 1 of this study utilized a 3 + 3 dose-escalation design to determine the MTD of oral paclitaxel 270 mg plus oral encequidar 15 mg administered daily. Dose escalation was achieved by increasing the number of consecutive dosing days per week (from 2 to 5 days per week). Dosing occurred for 3 consecutive weeks out of a 4-week cycle. Part 2 treated additional patients at the MTD to determine tolerability and recommended phase II dose (RP2D). Adverse events, tumor responses, and pharmacokinetic profiles were assessed. A total of 34 patients (n = 24 in Part 1, n = 10 in Part 2) received treatment. The MTD of Oraxol was determined to be 270 mg daily × 5 days per week per protocol definition and this was declared the RP2D. The most common treatment-related adverse events were fatigue, neutropenia, and nausea/vomiting. Hypersensitivity-type reactions were not observed. Of the 28 patients evaluable for response, 2 (7.1%) achieved partial response and 18 (64.3%) achieved stable disease. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed rapid absorption of paclitaxel when administered orally following encequidar. Paclitaxel daily exposure was comparable following 2-5 days dose levels. The oral administration of encequidar with paclitaxel was safe, achieved clinically relevant paclitaxel levels, and showed evidence of anti-tumor activity. Many chemotherapeutics, such as paclitaxel, are administered intravenously as they suffer from poor oral bioavailability, partly because of efflux mechanism of P-glycoprotein in the intestinal epithelium. To date, no drug has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that selectively blocks this efflux pump. We sought to identify a compound that selectively inhibits P-glycoprotein in the gastrointestinal mucosa with poor oral bioavailability, thus eliminating the issues such as bone marrow toxicity associated with systemic inhibition of P-glycoprotein. Here, we describe the discovery of highly potent, selective, and poorly orally bioavailable P-glycoprotein inhibitor ",

         "Ornithine is a non-proteinogenic α-amino acid that plays a role in the urea cycle. Ornithine is abnormally accumulated in the body in ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. The radical is ornithyl. == Role in urea cycle == L-Ornithine is one of the products of the action of the enzyme arginase on L-arginine, creating urea. Therefore, ornithine is a central part of the urea cycle, which allows for the disposal of excess nitrogen. Ornithine is recycled and, in a manner, is a catalyst. First, ammonia is converted into carbamoyl phosphate (H2NC(O)OPO2−3) by carbamoyl phosphate synthetase. Ornithine transcarbamylase catalyzes the reaction between carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine to form citrulline and phosphate (Pi). Another amino group is added from aspartate, producing arginine and denitrogenated fumarate. The resulting arginine (a guanidinium compound) is hydrolysed back to ornithine, producing urea. The amino groups of urea come from the ammonia and aspartate, and the nitrogen in ornithine remains intact. Ornithine is not an amino acid coded for by DNA, that is, not proteinogenic. However, in mammalian non-hepatic tissues, the main use of the urea cycle is in arginine biosynthesis, so, as an intermediate in metabolic processes, ornithine is quite important. == Other reactions == Ornithine, via the action of ornithine decarboxylase (E.C. 4.1.1.17), is the starting point for the synthesis of polyamines such as putrescine. In bacteria, such as E. coli, ornithine can be synthesized from L-glutamate. == Research == === Exercise fatigue === L-Ornithine supplementation attenuated fatigue in subjects in a placebo-controlled study using a cycle ergometer. The results suggested that L-ornithine has an antifatigue effect in increasing the efficiency of energy consumption and promoting the excretion of ammonia. === Weightlifting supplement === Amino acid supplements, including L-ornithine, are frequently marketed to bodybuilders and weightlifters with claims for increasing levels of human growth hormone (HGH), muscle mass, and strength. A 1993 short 4-day clinical study reported that L-ornithine in combination with L-arginine and L-lysine at 2 g/d each did not increase HGH. A review from 2002 on the topic concluded \"The use of specific amino acids to stimulate GH release by athletes is not recommended.\" === Cirrhosis === L-Ornithine L-aspartate (LOLA), a stable salt of ornithine and aspartic acid, has been used in the treatment of cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy. == See also == Bisorcic 3-Methylornithine == References == == External links == Ornithine mass Spectrum",

         "Paroxetine, sold under the brand name Paxil among others, is an antidepressant medication of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class used to treat major depressive disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD), panic disorder, social anxiety disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder, and premenstrual dysphoric disorder. It has also been used in the treatment of premature ejaculation, and hot flashes due to menopause. It is taken orally (by mouth). Common side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, loss of appetite, sweating, trouble sleeping, and sexual dysfunction. Serious side effects may include suicidal thoughts in those under the age of 25, serotonin syndrome, and mania. While the rate of side effects appears similar compared to other SSRIs and SNRIs, antidepressant discontinuation syndrome may occur more often. Use in pregnancy is not recommended, while use during breastfeeding is relatively safe. It is believed to work by blocking the reuptake of the chemical serotonin by neurons in the brain. Paroxetine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1992 and initially sold by GlaxoSmithKline. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 92nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 7 million prescriptions. In 2018, it was in the top 10 of most prescribed antidepressants in the United States. == Medical uses == Paroxetine is primarily used to treat major depressive disorder, obsessive–compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder. It is also occasionally used for agoraphobia, generalized anxiety disorder, premenstrual dysphoric disorder, and menopausal hot flashes. === Depression === A variety of meta-analyses have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of paroxetine in depression. They have variously concluded that paroxetine is superior or equivalent to placebo and that it is equivalent to other antidepressants. Despite this, there was no clear evidence that paroxetine was better or worse compared with other antidepressants at increasing response to treatment at any point in time. === Anxiety disorders === Paroxetine was the first antidepressant approved in the United States for the treatment of panic disorder. Several studies have concluded that paroxetine is superior to placebo in the treatment of panic disorder. Paroxetine has demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of social anxiety disorder in adults and children. It is also beneficial for people with co-occurring social anxiety disorder and alcohol use disorder. It appears to be similar to a number of other SSRIs. Paroxetine is used in the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder. Comparative efficacy of paroxetine is equivalent to that of clomipramine and venlafaxine. Paroxetine is also effective for children with obsessive-compulsive disorder. Paroxetine is approved for the treatment of PTSD in the United States, Japan, and Europe. In the United States, it is approved for short-term use. Paroxetine is also FDA-approved for generalized anxiety disorder. === Menopausal hot flashes === In 2013, low-dose paroxetine was approved in the US for the treatment of moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats associated with menopause. At the low dose used for menopausal hot flashes, side effects are similar to placebo and dose tapering is not required for discontinuation. === Fibromyalgia === Studies have also shown paroxetine \"appears to be well-tolerated and improve the overall symptomatology in patients with fibromyalgia\", but is less robust in helping with the pain involved. == Adverse effects == Common side effects include drowsiness, dry mouth, loss of appetite, sweating, insomnia, and sexual dysfunction. Serious side effects may include suicide in those under the age of 25, serotonin syndrome, and mania. While the rate of side effects appears similar compared to other SSRIs and SNRIs, antidepressant discontinuation syndromes may occur more often. Use in pregnancy is not recommended, while use during breastfeeding is relatively safe. Paroxetine shares many of the common adverse effects of SSRIs, including (with the corresponding rates seen in people treated with placebo in parentheses): nausea 26% (9%) diarrhea 12% (8%) constipation 14% (9%) dry mouth 18% (12%) somnolence 23% (9%) insomnia 13% (6%) headache 18% (17%) hypomania 1% (0.3%) blurred vision 4% (1%) loss of appetite 6% (2%) nervousness 5% (3%) paraesthesia 4% (2%) dizziness 13% (6%) asthenia (weakness; 15% (6%)) tremor 8% (2%) sweating 11% (2%) sexual dysfunction (≥10% incidence). Most of these adverse effects are transient and go away with continued treatment. Central and peripheral 5-HT3 receptor stimulation is believed to result in the gastrointestinal effects observed with SSRI treatment. Compared to other SSRIs, it has a lower incidence of diarrhea, but a higher incidence of anticholinergic effects (e.g., dry mouth, constipation, blurred vision, etc.), sedation/somnolence/drowsiness, sexual side effects, and weight gain. Due to reports of adverse withdrawal reactions upon terminating treatment, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use at the European Medicines Agency recommends gradually reducing over several weeks or months if the decision to withdraw is made. See also Discontinuation syndrome (withdrawal). Mania or hypomania may occur in 1% of patients with depression and up to 12% of patients with bipolar disorder. This side effect can occur in individuals with no history of mania, but it may be more likely to occur in those with bipolar disorder or with a family history of mania. Paroxetine is described as a 'hepatoxic agent' and has been associated with hepatoxicity and jaundice. === Suicide === Like other antidepressants, paroxetine may increase the risk of suicidal thinking and behaviour in people under the age of 25. The FDA conducted a statistical analysis of paroxetine clinical trials in children and adolescents in 2004 and found an increase in suicidality and ideation as compared to placebo, which was observed in trials for both depression and anxiety disorders. In 2015, a paper published in The BMJ that reanalysed the original case notes argued that in Study 329, assessing paroxetine and imipramine against placebo in adolescents with depression, the incidence of suicidal behavior had been under-reported and the efficacy exaggerated for paroxetine. === Sexual dysfunction === Sexual dysfunction, including loss of libido, anorgasmia, lack of vaginal lubrication, and erectile dysfunction, is one of the most commonly encountered adverse effects of treatment with paroxetine and other SSRIs. While early clinical trials suggested a relatively low rate of sexual dysfunction, more recent studies in which the investigator actively inquires about sexual problems suggest that the incidence is higher than 70%. Symptoms of sexual dysfunction have been reported to persist after discontinuing SSRIs, although this is thought to be occasional. === Pregnancy === Antidepressant exposure (including paroxetine) is associated with shorter duration of pregnancy (by three days), increased risk of preterm delivery (by 55%), lower birth weight (by 75 g or 2.6 oz), and lower Apgar scores (by <0.4 points). The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that for pregnant women and women planning to become pregnant, paroxetine \"be avoided, if possible\", as it may be associated with increased risk of birth defects. Babies born to women who used paroxetine during the first trimester have an increased risk of cardiovascular malformations, primarily ventricular and atrial septal defects. Unless the benefits of paroxetine justify continuing treatment, consideration should be given to stopping or switching to another antidepressant. Paroxetine use during pregnancy is associated with about 1.5– to 1.7-fold increase in congenital birth defects, in particular, heart defects, cleft lip and palate, clubbed feet, or any birth defects. === Discontinuation syndrome === Many psychoactive medications can cause withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation from administration. Paroxetine has among the highest incidence rates and severity of withdrawal syndrome of any medication of its class. Common withdrawal symptoms for paroxetine include nausea, dizziness, lightheadedness and vertigo; insomnia, nightmares, and vivid dreams; feelings of electricity in the body, as well as rebound depression and anxiety. A liquid formulation of paroxetine is available and allows a very gradual decrease of the dose, which may prevent discontinuation syndrome. Another recommendation is to temporarily switch to fluoxetine, which has a longer half-life and thus decreases the severity of discontinuation syndrome. In 2002, the U.S. FDA published a warning regarding \"severe\" discontinuation symptoms among those terminating paroxetine treatment, including paraesthesia, nightmares, and dizziness. The agency also warned of case reports describing agitation, sweating, and nausea. In connection with a Glaxo spokesperson's statement that withdrawal reactions occur only in 0.2% of patients and are \"mild and short-lived\", the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Associations said GSK had breached two of the federation's codes of practice. Paroxetine prescribing information posted at GlaxoSmithKline has been updated related to the occurrence of a discontinuation syndrome, including serious discontinuation symptoms. == Overdose == Acute overdosage is often manifested by emesis, lethargy, ataxia, tachycardia, and seizures. Plasma, serum, or blood concentrations of paroxetine may be measured to monitor therapeutic administration, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to aid in the medicolegal investigation of fatalities. Plasma paroxetine concentrations are generally in a range of 40–400 μg/L in persons receiving daily therapeutic doses and 200–2,000 μg/L in poisoned patients. Postmortem blood levels have ranged from 1–4 mg/L in acute lethal overdose situations. Along with the other SSRIs, sertraline and fluoxetine, paroxetine is considered a low-risk drug in cases of overdose. == Interactions == Interactions with other drugs acting on the serotonin system or impairing the metabolism of serotonin may increase the risk of serotonin syndrome or neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS)-like reaction. Such reactions have been observed with SNRIs and SSRIs alone, but particularly with concurrent use of triptans, MAO inhibitors, antipsychotics, or other dopamine antagonists. The prescribing information states that paroxetine should \"not be used in combination with an MAOI (including linezolid, an antibiotic which is a reversible non-selective MAOI), or within 14 days of discontinuing treatment with an MAOI\", and should not be used in combination with pimozide, thioridazine, tryptophan, or warfarin. Paroxetine interacts with the following cytochrome P450 enzymes: CYP2D6 for which it is both a substrate and a potent inhibitor. CYP2B6 (strong) inhibitor. CYP3A4 (weak) inhibitor. CYP1A2 (weak) inhibitor. CYP2C9 (weak) inhibitor. CYP2C19 (weak) inhibitor. Paroxetine has been shown to be an inhibitor of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Paroxetine is the most potent and one of the most specific selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It also binds to the allosteric site of the serotonin transporter, similarly to escitalopram, though less potently so. Paroxetine also inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine to a lesser extent (<50 nmol/L). Based on evidence from four weeks of administration in rats, the equivalent of 20 mg paroxetine taken once daily occupies approximately 88% of serotonin transporters in the prefrontal cortex. Paroxetine is a phenylpiperidine and might have some affinity for opioid receptors. === Pharmacokinetics === Paroxetine is well-absorbed following oral administration. It has an absolute bioavailability of about 50%, with evidence of a saturable first pass effect. When taken orally, it achieves maximum concentration in about 6–10 hours and reaches steady-state in 7–14 days. Paroxetine exhibits significant interindividual variations in volume of distribution and clearance. Less than 2% of an oral dose is excreted in urine unchanged. Paroxetine is a mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP2D6. == Society and culture == Paroxetine was approved for medical use in the United States in 1992 and initially sold by GlaxoSmithKline. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 92nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 7 million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. GlaxoSmithKline has paid substantial fines, paid settlements in class-action lawsuits, and become the subject of several highly critical books about its marketing of paroxetine, in particular, the off-label marketing of paroxetine for children, the suppression of negative research results relating to its use in children, and allegations that it failed to warn consumers of substantial withdrawal effects associated with the use of the drug. === Marketing === In 2004, GSK agreed to settle charges of consumer fraud for $2.5 million. The legal discovery process also uncovered evidence of deliberate, systematic suppression of unfavorable Paxil research results. One of GSK's internal documents read, \"It would be commercially unacceptable to include a statement that efficacy [in children] had not been demonstrated, as this would undermine the profile of paroxetine\". In 2012, the United States Department of Justice fined GlaxoSmithKline $3 billion for withholding data, unlawfully promoting use in those under 18, and preparing an article that misleadingly reported the effects of paroxetine in adolescents with depression following its clinical trial study 329. In February 2016, the UK Competition and Markets Authority imposed record fines of £45 million on companies that were found to have infringed European Union and UK Competition law by entering into agreements to delay the market entry of generic versions of the drug in the UK. GlaxoSmithKline received the bulk of the fines, being fined £37,600,757. Other companies that produce generics were issued fines which collectively total £7,384,146. UK public health services are likely to claim damages for being overcharged in the period where the generic versions of the drug were illegally blocked from the market, as the generics are over 70% less expensive. GlaxoSmithKline may also face actions from other generic manufacturers who incurred losses as a result of the anticompetitive conduct. In April 2016, appeals were lodged with the Competition Appeal Tribunal by the companies which were fined. GSK marketed paroxetine through television advertisements in the 1990s and 2000s. Commercials also aired for the CR version of the drug beginning in 2003. === Economics === In 2007, paroxetine was ranked 94th on the list of bestselling drugs, with over $1 billion in sales. In 2006, paroxetine was the fifth-most prescribed antidepressant in the U.S. retail market, with more than 19.7 million prescriptions. In 2007, sales had dropped slightly to 18.1 million but paroxetine remained the fifth-most prescribed antidepressant in the U.S. === Brand names === Brand names include Aropax, Paretin, Brisdelle, Deroxat, Paxil, Pexeva, Paxtine, Paxetin, Paroxat, Paraxyl, Sereupin, Daparox and Seroxat. == Research == Several studies have suggested that paroxetine can be used in the treatment of premature ejaculation. In particular, intravaginal ejaculation latency time (IELT) was found to increase 6- to 13-fold, which was somewhat longer than the delay achieved by the treatment with other SSRIs (fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, sertraline, and citalopram). However, paroxetine taken acutely (\"on demand\") 3–10 hours before coitus resulted only in a \"clinically irrelevant and sexually unsatisfactory\" 1.5-fold delay of ejaculation and was inferior to clomipramine, which induced a fourfold delay. There is also evidence that paroxetine may be effective in the treatment of compulsive gambling and hot flashes. Benefits of paroxetine prescription for diabetic neuropathy or chronic tension headache are uncertain. Although the evidence is conflicting, paroxetine may be effective for the treatment of dysthymia, a chronic disorder involving depressive symptoms for most days of the year. There is evidence to support that paroxetine selectively binds to and inhibits G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2 (GRK2) in mice with heart failure. Since GRK2 regulates the activity of the beta adrenergic receptor, which becomes desensitized in cases of heart failure, paroxetine (or a paroxetine derivative) could be used as a heart failure treatment in the future. Paroxetine has been identified as a potential disease-modifying osteoarthritis drug. == Veterinary use == Paroxetine may be useful in the treatment of canine or feline behavioral diagnoses and is effective in the treatment of social anxiety, depression, and agitation associated with depression. == Other organisms == Paroxetine is a common finding in wastewater. It is highly toxic to the alga Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata (syn. Raphidocelis subcapitata). It also is toxic to the soil nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Alberca et al., 2016 found that paroxetine acts as a trypanocide against T. cruzi. Alberca et al., 2016 finds a leishmanicide effect. Alberca finds that paroxetine produces cell death of the promastigotes of L. infantum. The mechanism of action remains unknown. Various types of bacteria can break down paroxetine in the environment. These include, for example Pseudomonas sp., Bosea sp., Shewanella sp., Species of Chitinophagaceae and Acinetobacter sp. == References == == External links == Media related to Paroxetine at Wikimedia Commons",

         "Brigatinib, sold under the brand name Alunbrig among others, is a small-molecule targeted cancer therapy being developed by Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Brigatinib acts as both an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor. Brigatinib could overcome resistance to osimertinib conferred by the EGFR C797S mutation if it is combined with an anti-EGFR antibody such as cetuximab or panitumumab. == Mechanism of action == Brigatinib is an inhibitor of ALK and mutated EGFR. ALK was first identified as a chromosomal rearrangement in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Genetic studies indicate that abnormal expression of ALK is a key driver of certain types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and neuroblastomas, as well as ALCL. Since ALK is generally not expressed in normal adult tissues, it represents a highly promising molecular target for cancer therapy. Brigatinib inhibits ROS proto-oncogene-1 fusions and EGFR mutations and has a remarkable effect on the central nervous system. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is another validated target in NSCLC. Additionally, the T790M \"gatekeeper\" mutation is linked in approximately 50 percent of patients who grow resistant to first-generation EGFR inhibitors. While second-generation EGFR inhibitors are in development, clinical efficacy has been limited due to toxicity thought to be associated with inhibiting the native (endogenous or unmutated) EGFR. A therapy designed to target EGFR, the T790M mutation but avoiding inhibition of native EGFR is another promising molecular target for cancer therapy. == History == === Regulatory approval === Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc. filed an investigational new drug (IND) application to the US FDA on August 29, 2016. In 2016, brigatinib was granted orphan drug status by the FDA for treatment of NSCLC. On 28 April 2017, it was granted an accelerated approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); as a 2nd-line therapy for ALK-positive NSCLC. In 2020, it was approved as first-line treatment for ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC patients. === Intellectual property === On 22 April 2015, Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced the issuance of its first U.S. patent on brigatinib, the protection is through December 30, 2030. The United States Patent and Trademark Office granted U.S. Patent No. 9,012,462 under the title, \"Phosphorous Derivatives as Kinase Inhibitors.\" === Commercialization === Brigatinib is manufactured by Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ARIA) which is focused on rare cancers. Ariad then was acquired by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (TSE: 4502) in February 2017 through a tender offer (for $24.00 per share in cash) and subsequent merger of Ariad with Kiku Merger Co., Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceuticals U.S.A.

         "Medical",
         "Taurolidine is an antimicrobial that is used to prevent infections in catheters. Side effects and the induction of bacterial resistance is uncommon. It is also being studied as a treatment for cancer. It is derived from the endogenous amino acid derivative taurine. The putative method of action involves the metabolism of taurolidine to taurinamide and ultimately taurine and water, liberating formaldehyde that chemically reacts with the mureins in the bacterial cell wall and with the amino and hydroxyl groups of endotoxins and exotoxins. This reaction denatures the endotoxins and complex polysaccharide and lipopolysaccharide components of the bacterial cell wall and inactivates susceptible exotoxins. == Medical uses == Taurolidine is an antimicrobial agent used as part of a catheter lock solution in an effort to prevent catheter infections. Catheter lock solution in home parenteral nutrition (HPN) or total parenteral nutrition (TPN): catheter-related blood stream infections (CRBSI) remains the most common serious complication associated with long-term parenteral nutrition. The use of taurolidine as a catheter lock solution shows a reduction of CRBSI. The overall quality of the evidence however is not strong enough to justify routine use. Catheter lock solution: Taurolidine decreases the adherence of bacteria and fungi to host cells by destructing the fimbriae and flagella and thus prevent the biofilm formation. Taurolidine is the active ingredient of antimicrobial catheter lock solutions for the prevention and treatment of catheter related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) and is suitable for use in all catheter based vascular access devices. Bacterial resistance against taurolidine has never been observed in various studies. The use of a taurolidine lock solution may decrease the risk of catheter infection in children with cancer but the evidence is tentative. == Side effects == No systemic side effects have been identified. The safety of taurolidine has also been confirmed in clinical studies with long-term intravenous administration of high doses (up to 20 grams daily). In the body, taurolidine is metabolized rapidly via the metabolites taurultam and methylol taurinamide, which also have a bactericidal action, to taurine, an endogenous aminosulphonic acid, carbon dioxide and water. Therefore, no toxic effects are known or expected in the event of accidental injection. Burning sensation while instilling, numbness, erythema, facial flushing, headache, epistaxis, and nausea have been reported. === Toxicology === Taurolidine has a relatively low acute and subacute toxicity. Intravenous injection of 5 grams taurolidine into humans over 0.5–2 hours produce only burning sensation while instilling, numbness, and erythema at the injection sites. For treatment of peritonitis, taurolidine was administered by peritoneal lavage, intraperitoneal instillation or intravenous infusion, or by a combination thereof. The total daily dose ranged widely from 0.5 to 50 g. The total cumulative dose ranged from 0.5 to 721 g. In those patients who received intravenous taurolidine, the daily intravenous dose was usually 15 to 30 g but several patients received up to 40 g/day. Total daily doses of up to 40 g and total cumulative doses exceeding 300 g were safe and well tolerated. == Pharmacology == Metabolism: Taurolidine and taurultam are quickly metabolized to taurinamide, taurine, carbon dioxide and water. Taurolidine exists in equilibrium with taurultam and N-methylol-taurultam in aqueous solution. Pharmacokinetic (elimination): The half-life of the terminal elimination phase of taurultam is about 1.5 hours, and of the taurinamide metabolite about 6 hours. 25% of the taurolidine dose applied is renally eliminated as taurinamide and/or taurine. === Mechanism of action === Following administration of taurolidine, the antimicrobial and antiendotoxin activity of the taurolidine molecule is conferred by the release of three active methylol (hydroxymethyl) groups as taurolidine is rapidly metabolized by hydrolysis via methylol taurultam to methylol taurinamide and taurine. These labile N-methylol derivatives of taurultam and taurinamide react with the bacterial cell-wall resulting in lysis of the bacteria, and by inter- and intramolecular cross-linking of the lipopolysaccharide-protein complex, neutralization of the bacterial endotoxins which is enhanced by enzymatic activation. This mechanism of action is accelerated and maximised when taurolidine is pre-warmed to 37 °C (99 °F). Microbes are killed and the resulting toxins are inactivated; the destruction time in vitro is 30 minutes. The chemical mode of action of taurolidine via its reactive methylol groups confers greater potency in vivo than indicated by in vitro minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values, and also appears to preclude susceptibility to resistance mechanisms. Taurolidine binding to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) prevents microbial adherence to host epithelial cells, thereby prevents microbial invasion of uninfected host cells. Although the mechanism underlying its antineoplastic activity has not been fully elucidated, it may be related to this agent's anti-adherence property. Taurolidine has been shown to block interleukin 1 (IL-1) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In addition, taurolidine also promotes apoptosis by inducing various apoptotic factors and suppresses the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a protein that plays an important role in angiogenesis. Taurolidine is highly active against the common infecting pathogens associated with peritonitis and catheter sepsis, this activity extends across a wide-spectrum of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria and fungi (with no diminution of effect in the presence of biological fluids, e.g. blood, serum, pus). Gram-positive bacteria (MIC of 1–2 mg/mL): Staphylococcus (including multiple-antibiotic resistant coagulase negative strains, methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Streptococcus, Enterococcus. Gram-negative bacteria (MIC of 0.5–5 mg/mL): Aerobacter species, Citrobacter species, Enterobacter species, Escherichia coli, Proteus species (indole negative), Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas species (including P. aeruginosa), Salmonella species, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella species. Anaerobes (MIC 0.03–0.3 mg/mL): Bacteroides species (including B. fragilis), Fusobacteriota, Clostridium species, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. Fungi (MIC 0.3–5 mg/mL): Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus species, Trichophyton rubrum, Epidermophyton floccosum, Pityrosporum ovale. == Chemical properties == The chemical name for taurolidine is 4,4'-Methylene-bis(1,2,4-thiadiazinane)-1,1,1’,1'-tetraoxide. It is a white to off white odourless crystalline powder. It is practically insoluble in chloroform, slightly soluble in boiling acetone, ethanol, methanol, and ethyl acetate, sparingly soluble in water 8 at 20° and ethyl alcohol, soluble in dilute hydrochloric acid, and dilute sodium hydroxide, and freely soluble in N,N-dimethylformamide (at 60 °C). == History == Taurolidine was first synthesized in the laboratories of Geistlich Pharma AG, Switzerland in 1972. Clinical trials begun in 1975 in patients with severe peritonitis. == Research == Taurolidine demonstrates some anti-tumor properties, with positive results seen in early-stage clinical investigations using the drug to treat gastrointestinal malignancies and tumors of the central nervous system. More recently, it has been found to exert antineoplastic activity. Taurolidine induces cancer cell death through a variety of mechanisms. Even now, all the antineoplastic pathways it employs are not completely elucidated. It has been shown to enhance apoptosis, inhibit angiogenesis, reduce tumor adherence, downregulate pro-inflammatory cytokine release, and stimulate anticancer immune regulation following surgical trauma. Apoptosis is activated through both a mitochondrial cytochrome-c-dependent mechanism and an extrinsic direct pathway. A lot of in vitro and animal data support taurolidine's tumoricidal action. Taurolidine has been used as an antimicrobial agent in the clinical setting since the 1970s and thus far appears nontoxic. The nontoxic nature of taurolidine makes it a favorable option compared with current chemotherapeutic regimens. Few published clinical studies exist evaluating the role of taurolidine as a chemotherapeutic agent. The literature lacks a gold-standard level 1 randomized clinical trial to evaluate taurolidine's potential antineoplastic benefits. However, these trials are currently underway. Such randomized control studies are vital to clarify the role of taurolidine in modern cancer treatment. == References ==",

         "Fenretinide (N-(4-hydroxyphenyl)retinamide; 4-HPR) (INN) is a synthetic retinoid derivative. Retinoids are substances related to vitamin A. It has been investigated for potential use in the treatment of cancer, as well as in the treatment of cystic fibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, acne, psoriasis, and has been found to also slow the production and accumulation of a toxin that leads to vision loss in Stargardt's patients. In cancer studies, Fenretinide treatment may cause ceramide (a wax-like substance) to build up in tumor cells and is associated with the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in cell death through apoptosis and/or necrosis. Fenretinide accumulates preferentially in fatty tissue such as the breast, which may contribute to the effectiveness of fenretinide against breast cancer. Phase III clinical trial data has suggested that fenretinide reduces breast cancer relapse in pre-menopausal women. Common side effects associated with fenretinide treatment include skin dryness and night-blindness, which is reversible upon cessation of treatment. Specific types of cancer under investigation include or have included ovarian, prostate, cervical, lung, renal, bladder, breast, glioma, skin, head and neck carcinoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, neuroblastoma, and Ewing's sarcoma. == References == == External links == Numerous references and links to current and past clinical trials and studies of fenretinide can be found at the Journal of Clinical Oncology website",

         "Eravacycline (TP-434, Xerava) is a synthetic halogenated tetracycline class antibiotic by Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals. It is closely related to tigecycline. It has a broad spectrum of activity including many multi-drug resistant strains of bacteria. Phase III studies in complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) and complicated urinary tract infections (cUTI) were recently completed with mixed results. Eravacycline was granted fast track designation by the FDA and is currently available in USA. == Medical uses == Eravacycline has shown broad spectrum of activity against a variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including multi-drug resistant strains, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. It is currently being formulated as for intravenous and oral administration. === Spectrum of activity === ==== Gram-positive organisms ==== Staphylococcus aureus (both methicillin-resistant and sensitive strains) Streptococcus pneumoniae Enterococcus faecalis Enterococcus faecium (including vancomycin resistant strains) ==== Gram-negative organisms ==== Acinetobacter baumannii Stenotrophomonas maltophilia Haemophilus influenzae Moraxella catarrhalis Neisseria gonorrhoeae Enterobacteriaceae Escherichia coli (including ESBL-producing strains) Klebsiella pneumoniae (including carbapenem resistant strains) Klebsiella oxytoca Enterobacter species Citrobacter species Proteus mirabilis Serratia marcescens Similar to other tetracycline derivatives, eravacycline is poorly active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a MIC90 = 16 mcg/mL (range 0.06-64 mcg/mL). Eravacycline maintains in-vitro activity against Enterobacteriaceae carrying the mcr-1 gene responsible for polymyxin b/colistin resistance. == Clinical trials == Current and past clinical trial information: [1] === Phase 3 trials === ==== Complicated Intra-abdominal infections (IGNITE 1) ==== The IGNITE 1 trial compared twice-daily IV eravacycline to once-daily ertapenem for the treatment of cIAI. A total of 541 patients were included and eravacycline demonstrated noninferiority to ertapenem. An additional pivotal phase 3 study (IGNITE 4) is planned for late 2016 with initial results likely available in the fourth quarter of 2017. ==== Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections (IGNITE 4) ==== IGNITE 4 assessed twice-daily intravenous eravacycline(1.0 mg/kg every 12 hours) compared to those receiving meropenem (1g every 8 hours). The study enrolled 500 adult patients with the primary endpoint being clinical response at the test-of-cure visit which is 25–31 days after initial dosing. Primary efficiency analysis was conducted using a 12.5% non-inferiority margin in the microbiological intent-to-treat (micro-ITT) population. In July 2017, Tetraphase pharmaceuticals released top line data via press showing clinical cure rates in the micro-ITT population to be 90.8% and 91.2% for eravacycline (n=195) and meropenem (n=205), respectively (95% CI: -6.3%,5.3%). Primary analysis was conducted using a 12.5% non-inferiority margin of the modified intent-to-treat (MITT) and clinically evaluable (CE) patient populations. Clinical cure rates in the MITT population were 92.4% and 91.6% for eravacycline (n=250) and meropenem (n=249), respectively (95% CI: -4.1%,5.8%). Clinical cure rates in the CE population were 96.9% and 96.1% for eravacycline (n=225) and meropenem (n=231), respectively (95% CI: -2.9%,4.5%). Eravacycline met the primary efficacy endpoints according to the FDA and EMA guidelines. The secondary analyses were consistent with, and supportive of, the primary outcome according to Tetraphase. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events (SAEs) in the trial. Treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAEs) rates were similar in both treatment groups with the most commonly reported drug-related adverse events (AEs) for eravacycline were infusion site reactions, nausea and vomiting, each occurring at a rate of less than 5%. The most common Gram-negative pathogens in the study included Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas and Bacteroides. Full data from IGNITE4 will become available as the company prepares to submit its New Drug Application (NDA) in the first quarter of 2018 for Eravacycline treatment of Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections. ==== Complicated Urinary Tract infections (IGNITE 2) ==== The IGNITE 2 trial compared 7 days of IV eravacycline to IV levofloxacin with the option to convert patients in either group to oral therapy after 3 days for cUTI. Overall, eravacyline was inferior to levofloxacin in response rate (60.4 vs 66.9%); however it was noted that patients who completed therapy with the IV formulation had higher response rates, suggesting formulation issues with the oral option. Due to the performance of the IV formulation, an additional phase 3 trial is planned to support a supplemental NDA for the cUTI indication. ===== Complicated Urinary Tract Infections (IGNITE 3) ===== IGNITE3 is currently ongoing starting January 2017 with expected completion December 2018. This study is evaluating IV eravacycline (1.5 mg/kg every 24 hours) compared to ertapenem (1g every 24 hours) for the treatment of cUTI. IGNITE3 is currently enrolling approximately 1,000 patients who will be randomized 1:1 to receive intravenous eravacycline or ertapenem for a minimum of 5 days, and will then be eligible for transition to oral levofloxacin. The primary endpoints are Proportion of Participants in the microbiological Intent-to-treat (micro-ITT) Population demonstrating Clinical Cure and Microbiologic Success at the End of Intravenous (EOI) Visit [Time Frame: EOI visit (within 1 day of the completion of intravenous study drug treatment) ] & Proportion of Participants in the micro-ITT Population Demonstrating Clinical Cure and Microbiologic Success at the Test-Of-Cure (TOC) Visit [ Time Frame: TOC visit (14–17 days after randomization) ]. With secondary endpoints(outcomes) testing Proportion of Participants in the microbiological Modified Intent-To-Treat (micro-MITT) Population and the Microbiologically Evaluable (ME) Population Demonstrating Microbiologic Success at the TOC Visit [ Time Frame: TOC visit (14–17 days after randomization) ] == Commercial information == Eravacycline is under development by Tetraphase Pharmaceuticals Inc.

         "Medical",
         "Noscapine, also known as narcotine, nectodon, nospen, anarcotine and (archaic) opiane, is a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid of the phthalideisoquinoline structural subgroup, which has been isolated from numerous species of the family Papaveraceae (poppy family). It lacks effects associated with opioids such as sedation, euphoria, or analgesia (pain-relief) and lacks addictive potential. Noscapine is primarily used for its antitussive (cough-suppressing) effects. == Medical uses == Noscapine is often used as an antitussive medication. A 2012 Dutch guideline, however, does not recommend its use for acute coughing. == Side effects == Nausea Vomiting Loss of coordination Hallucinations (auditory and visual) Loss of sexual drive Swelling of prostate Loss of appetite Dilated pupils Increased heart rate Shaking and muscle spasms Chest pain Increased alertness Increased wakefulness Loss of stereoscopic vision == Interactions == Noscapine can increase the effects of centrally sedating substances such as alcohol and hypnotics. The drug should not be taken with monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), as unknown and potentially fatal effects may occur. Noscapine should not be taken in conjunction with warfarin as the anticoagulant effects of warfarin may be increased. == Biosynthesis == The biosynthesis of noscapine in P. somniferum begins with chorismic acid, which is synthesized via the shikimate pathway from erythrose 4-phosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate. Chorismic acid is a precursor to the amino acid tyrosine, the source of nitrogen in benzylisoquinoline alkaloids. Tyrosine can undergo a PLP-mediated transamination to form 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvic acid (4-HPP), followed by a TPP-mediated decarboxylation to form 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (4-HPAA). Tyrosine can also be hydroxylated to form 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), followed by a PLP-mediated decarboxylation to form dopamine. Norcoclaurine synthase (NCS) catalyzes a Pictet-Spengler reaction between 4-HPAA and dopamine to synthesize (S)-norcoclaurine, providing the characteristic benzylisoquinoline scaffold. (S)-Norcoclaurine is sequentially 6-O-methylated (6OMT), N-methylated (CNMT), 3-hydroxylated (NMCH), and 4′-O-methylated (4′OMT), with the use of cofactors S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM) and NADP+ for methylations and hydroxylations, respectively. These reactions produce (S)-reticuline, a key branchpoint intermediate in the biosynthesis of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids. The remainder of the noscapine biosynthetic pathway is largely governed by a single biosynthetic 10-gene cluster. Genes comprising the cluster encode enzymes responsible for nine of the eleven remaining chemical transformations. First, berberine bridge enzyme (BBE), an enzyme not encoded by the cluster, forms the fused four-ring structure in (S)-scoulerine. BBE uses O2 as an oxidant and is aided by cofactor flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). Next, an O-methyltransferase (SOMT) methylates the 9-hydroxyl group. Canadine synthase (CAS) catalyzes the formation of a unique C2-C3 methylenedioxy bridge in (S)-canadine. An N-methylation (TNMT) and two hydroxylations (CYP82Y1, CYP82X2) follow, aided by SAM and O2/NADPH, respectively. The C13 alcohol is then acetylated by an acetyltransferase (AT1) using acetyl-CoA. Another cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP82X1) catalyzes the hydroxylation of C8, and the newly formed hemiaminal spontaneously cleaves, yielding a tertiary amine and aldehyde. A methyltransferase heterodimer (OMT2:OMT3) catalyzes a SAM-mediated O-methylation on C4′. The O-acetyl group is then cleaved by a carboxylesterase (CXE1), yielding an alcohol which immediately reacts with the neighboring C1 aldehyde to form a hemiacetal in a new five-membered ring. The apparent counteractivity between AT1 and CXE1 suggests that acetylation in this context is employed as a protective group, preventing hemiacetal formation until the ester is enzymatically cleaved. Finally, an NAD+-dependent short-chain dehydrogenase (NOS) oxidizes the hemiacetal to a lactone, completing noscapine biosynthesis. == Mechanism of action == Noscapine's antitussive effects appear to be primarily mediated by its σ–receptor agonist activity. Evidence for this mechanism is suggested by experimental evidence in rats. Pretreatment with rimcazole, a σ-specific antagonist, causes a dose-dependent reduction in antitussive activity of noscapine. Noscapine, and its synthetic derivatives called noscapinoids, are known to interact with microtubules and inhibit cancer cell proliferation == Structure analysis == The lactone ring is unstable and opens in basic media. The opposite reaction is presented in acidic media. The bond (C1−C3′) connecting the two optically active carbon atoms is also unstable. In aqueous solution of sulfuric acid and heating it dissociates into cotarnine (4-methoxy-6-methyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-[1,3]dioxolo[4,5-g]isoquinoline) and opic acid (6-formyl-2,3-dimethoxybenzoic acid). When noscapine is reduced with zinc/HCl, the bond C1−C3′ saturates and the molecule dissociates into hydrocotarnine (2-hydroxycotarnine) and meconine (6,7-dimethoxyisobenzofuran-1(3H)-one). == History == Noscapine was first isolated and characterized in chemical breakdown and properties in 1803 under the denomination of \"Narcotine\" by Jean-Francois Derosne, a French chemist in Paris. Then Pierre-Jean Robiquet, another French chemist, proved narcotine and morphine to be distinct alkaloids in 1831. Finally, Pierre-Jean Robiquet conducted over 20 years between 1815 and 1835 a series of studies in the enhancement of methods for the isolation of morphine, and also isolated in 1832 another very important component of raw opium, that he called codeine, currently a widely used opium-derived compound. == Society and culture == === Recreational use === There are anecdotal reports of the recreational use of over-the-counter drugs in several countries, being readily available from local pharmacies without a prescription. The effects, beginning around 45 to 120 minutes after consumption, are similar to dextromethorphan and alcohol intoxication. Unlike dextromethorphan, noscapine is not an NMDA receptor antagonist. === Noscapine in heroin === Noscapine can survive the manufacturing processes of heroin and can be found in street heroin. This is useful for law enforcement agencies, as the amounts of contaminants can identify the source of seized drugs. In 2005 in Liège, Belgium, the average noscapine concentration was around 8%. Noscapine has also been used to identify drug users who are taking street heroin at the same time as prescribed diamorphine. Since the diamorphine in street heroin is the same as the pharmaceutical diamorphine, examination of the contaminants is the only way to test whether street heroin has been used. Other contaminants used in urine samples alongside noscapine include papaverine and acetylcodeine. Noscapine is metabolised by the body, and is itself rarely found in urine, instead being present as the primary metabolites, cotarnine and meconine. Detection is performed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) but can also use a variety of other analytical techniques. == Research == === Clinical trials === The efficacy of noscapine in the treatment of certain hematological malignancies has been explored in the clinic. Polyploidy induction by noscapine has been observed in vitro in human lymphocytes at high dose levels (>30 μM); however, low-level systemic exposure, e.g. with cough medications, does not appear to present a genotoxic hazard. The mechanism of polyploidy induction by noscapine is suggested to involve either chromosome spindle apparatus damage or cell fusion. === Noscapine biosynthesis reconstitution === Many of the enzymes in the noscapine biosynthetic pathway was elucidated by the discovery of a 10 gene \"operon-like cluster\" named HN1. In 2016, the biosynthetic pathway of noscapine was reconstituted in yeast cells, allowing the drug to be synthesised without the requirement of harvest and purification from plant material. In 2018, the entire noscapine pathway was reconstituted and produced in yeast from simple molecules. In addition, protein expression was optimised in yeast, allowing production of noscapine to be improved 18,000 fold. It is hoped that this technology could be used to produce pharmaceutical alkaloids such as noscapine which are currently expressed at too low a yield in plantae to be mass-produced, allowing them to become marketable therapeutic drugs. === Anticancer derivatives === Noscapine is itself an antimitotic agent, therefore its analogs have great potential as novel anti-cancer drugs. Analogs having significant cytotoxic effects through modified 1,3-benzodioxole moiety have been developed. Similarly, N-alkyl amine, 1,3-diynyl, 9-vinyl-phenyl and 9-arylimino derivatives of noscapine have also been developed. Their mechanism of action is through tubulin inhibition. === Anti-inflammatory effects === Various studies have indicated that noscapine has anti-inflammatory effects and significantly reduces the levels of proinflammatory factors such as interleukin 1β (IL-1β), IFN-c, and IL-6. In this regard, in another study, Khakpour et al. examined the effect of noscapine against carrageenan-induced inflammation in rats. They found that noscapine at a dose of 5 mg/kg body weight in three hours after the injection has the most anti-inflammatory effects. Moreover, they showed that the amount of inflammation reduction at this dose of noscapine is approximately equal to indomethacin, a standard anti-inflammatory medication. Furthermore, Shiri et al. concluded that noscapine prevented the progression of bradykinin-induced inflammation in the rat's foot by antagonising bradykinin receptors. In addition, Zughaier et al. evaluated the anti-inflammatory effects of brominated noscapine. The brominated form of noscapine has been shown to inhibit the secretion of the cytokine TNF-α and the chemokine CXCL10 from macrophages, thereby reducing inflammation without affecting macrophage survival. Furthermore, the bromated derivative of noscapine has about 5 to 40 times more potent effects than noscapine. Again, this brominated derivative also inhibits toll-like receptors (TLR), TNF-α, and nitric oxide (NO) in human and mouse macrophages without causing toxicity. == See also == Cough syrup Codeine; Pholcodine Dextromethorphan; Dimemorfan Racemorphan; Dextrorphan; Levorphanol Butamirate Pentoxyverine Tipepidine Cloperastine Levocloperastine Narceine, a related opium alkaloid. == References ==",

         "Medical",
         "Cortisol is a steroid hormone in the glucocorticoid class of hormones and a stress hormone. When used as medication, it is known as hydrocortisone. It is produced in many animals, mainly by the zona fasciculata of the adrenal cortex in an adrenal gland. In other tissues, it is produced in lower quantities. By a diurnal cycle, cortisol is released and increases in response to stress and a low blood-glucose concentration. It functions to increase blood sugar through gluconeogenesis, suppress the immune system, and aid in the metabolism of calories. It also decreases bone formation. These stated functions are carried out by cortisol binding to glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid receptors inside a cell, which then bind to DNA to affect gene expression. == Health effects == === Metabolic response === ==== Metabolism of glucose ==== Cortisol plays a crucial role in regulating glucose metabolism and promotes gluconeogenesis (glucose synthesis) and glycogenesis (glycogen synthesis) in the liver and glycogenolysis (breakdown of glycogen) in skeletal muscle. It also increases blood glucose levels by reducing glucose uptake in muscle and adipose tissue, decreasing protein synthesis, and increasing the breakdown of fats into fatty acids (lipolysis). All of these metabolic steps have the net effect of increasing blood glucose levels, which fuel the brain and other tissues during the fight-or-flight response. Cortisol is also responsible for releasing amino acids from muscle, providing a substrate for gluconeogenesis. Its impact is complex and diverse. In general, cortisol stimulates gluconeogenesis (the synthesis of 'new' glucose from non-carbohydrate sources, which occurs mainly in the liver, but also in the kidneys and small intestine under certain circumstances). The net effect is an increase in the concentration of glucose in the blood, further complemented by a decrease in the sensitivity of peripheral tissue to insulin, thus preventing this tissue from taking the glucose from the blood. Cortisol has a permissive effect on the actions of hormones that increase glucose production, such as glucagon and adrenaline. Cortisol also plays an important, but indirect, role in liver and muscle glycogenolysis (the breaking down of glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate and glucose) which occurs as a result of the action of glucagon and adrenaline. Additionally, cortisol facilitates the activation of glycogen phosphorylase, which is necessary for adrenaline to have an effect on glycogenolysis. It is paradoxical that cortisol promotes not only gluconeogenesis (biosynthesis of glucose molecules) in the liver, but also glycogenesis (polymerization of glucose molecules into glycogen): cortisol is thus better thought of as stimulating glucose/glycogen turnover in the liver. This is in contrast to cortisol's effect in the skeletal muscle where glycogenolysis (breakdown of glycogen into glucose molecules) is promoted indirectly through catecholamines. In this way, cortisol and catecholamines work synergistically to promote the breakdown of muscle glycogen into glucose for use in the muscle tissue. ==== Metabolism of proteins and lipids ==== Elevated levels of cortisol, if prolonged, can lead to proteolysis (breakdown of proteins) and muscle wasting. The reason for proteolysis is to provide the relevant tissue with a feedstock for gluconeogenesis; see glucogenic amino acids. The effects of cortisol on lipid metabolism are more complicated since lipogenesis is observed in patients with chronic, raised circulating glucocorticoid (i.e. cortisol) levels, although an acute increase in circulating cortisol promotes lipolysis. The usual explanation to account for this apparent discrepancy is that the raised blood glucose concentration (through the action of cortisol) will stimulate insulin release. Insulin stimulates lipogenesis, so this is an indirect consequence of the raised cortisol concentration in the blood but it will only occur over a longer time scale. === Immune response === Cortisol prevents the release of substances in the body that cause inflammation. It is used to treat conditions resulting from overactivity of the B-cell-mediated antibody response. Examples include inflammatory and rheumatoid diseases, as well as allergies. Low-dose topical hydrocortisone, available as a nonprescription medicine in some countries, is used to treat skin problems such as rashes and eczema. Cortisol inhibits production of interleukin 12 (IL-12), interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), IFN-alpha, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T helper cells (Th1 cells), but upregulates interleukin 4, interleukin 10, and interleukin 13 by Th2 cells. This results in a shift toward a Th2 immune response rather than general immunosuppression. The activation of the stress system (and resulting increase in cortisol and Th2 shift) seen during an infection is believed to be a protective mechanism which prevents an over-activation of the inflammatory response. Cortisol can weaken the activity of the immune system. It prevents proliferation of T-cells by rendering the interleukin-2 producer T-cells unresponsive to interleukin-1, and unable to produce the T-cell growth factor IL-2. Cortisol downregulates the expression of the IL2 receptor IL-2R on the surface of the helper T-cell which is necessary to induce a Th1 'cellular' immune response, thus favoring a shift towards Th2 dominance and the release of the cytokines listed above which results in Th2 dominance and favors the 'humoral' B-cell mediated antibody immune response. Cortisol also has a negative-feedback effect on IL-1. The way this negative feedback works is that an immune stressor causes peripheral immune cells to release IL-1 and other cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-alpha. These cytokines stimulate the hypothalamus, causing it to release corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). CRH in turn stimulates the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) among other things in the adrenal gland, which (among other things) increases production of cortisol. Cortisol then closes the loop as it inhibits TNF-alpha production in immune cells and makes them less responsive to IL-1. Through this system, as long as an immune stressor is small, the response will be regulated to the correct level. Like a thermostat controlling a heater, the hypothalamus uses cortisol to turn off the heat once the production of cortisol matches the stress induced on the immune system. But in a severe infection or in a situation where the immune system is overly sensitized to an antigen (such as in allergic reactions) or there is a massive flood of antigens (as can happen with endotoxic bacteria) the correct set point might never be reached. Also because of downregulation of Th1 immunity by cortisol and other signaling molecules, certain types of infection, (notably Mycobacterium tuberculosis) can trick the body into getting locked in the wrong mode of attack, using an antibody-mediated humoral response when a cellular response is needed. Lymphocytes include the B-cell lymphocytes that are the antibody-producing cells of the body, and are thus the main agents of humoral immunity. A larger number of lymphocytes in the lymph nodes, bone marrow, and skin means the body is increasing its humoral immune response. B-cell lymphocytes release antibodies into the bloodstream. These antibodies lower infection through three main pathways: neutralization, opsonization, and complement activation. Antibodies neutralize pathogens by binding to surface adhering proteins, keeping pathogens from binding to host cells. In opsonization, antibodies bind to the pathogen and create a target for phagocytic immune cells to find and latch onto, allowing them to destroy the pathogen more easily. Finally antibodies can also activate complement molecules which can combine in various ways to promote opsonization or even act directly to lyse a bacteria. There are many different kinds of antibody and their production is highly complex, involving several types of lymphocyte, but in general lymphocytes and other antibody regulating and producing cells will migrate to the lymph nodes to aid in the release of these antibodies into the bloodstream. Rapid administration of corticosterone (the endogenous type I and type II receptor agonist) or RU28362 (a specific type II receptor agonist) to adrenalectomized animals induced changes in leukocyte distribution. On the other side of things, there are natural killer cells; these cells have the ability to take down larger in size threats like bacteria, parasites, and tumor cells. A separate study found that cortisol effectively disarmed natural killer cells, downregulating the expression of their natural cytotoxicity receptors. Prolactin has the opposite effect. It increases the expression of cytotoxicity receptors on natural killer cells, increasing their firepower. Cortisol stimulates many copper enzymes (often to 50% of their total potential), including lysyl oxidase, an enzyme that cross-links collagen and elastin. Especially valuable for immune response is cortisol's stimulation of the superoxide dismutase, since this copper enzyme is almost certainly used by the body to permit superoxides to poison bacteria. Some viruses, such as influenza and SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, are known to suppress the secretion of stress hormones to avoid the organism's immune response, thus avoiding the immune protection of the organism. These viruses suppress cortisol by producing a protein that mimics the human ACTH hormone but is incomplete and does not have hormonal activity. ACTH is a hormone that stimulates the adrenal gland to produce cortisol and other steroid hormones. However, the organism makes antibodies against this viral protein, and those antibodies also kill the human ACTH hormone, which leads to the suppression of adrenal gland function. Such adrenal suppression is a way for a virus to evade immune detection and elimination. This viral strategy can have severe consequences for the host (human that is infected by the virus), as cortisol is essential for regulating various physiological processes, such as metabolism, blood pressure, inflammation, and immune response. A lack of cortisol can result in a condition called adrenal insufficiency, which can cause symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, low blood pressure, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. Adrenal insufficiency can also impair the ability of the host to cope with stress and infections, as cortisol helps to mobilize energy sources, increase heart rate, and downregulate non-essential metabolic processes during stress. Therefore, by suppressing cortisol production, some viruses can escape the immune system and weaken the host's overall health and resilience. == Other effects == === Metabolism === ==== Glucose ==== Cortisol counteracts insulin, contributes to hyperglycemia by stimulating gluconeogenesis and inhibits the peripheral use of glucose (insulin resistance) by decreasing the translocation of glucose transporters (especially GLUT4) to the cell membrane. Cortisol also increases glycogen synthesis (glycogenesis) in the liver, storing glucose in easily accessible form. ==== Bone and collagen ==== Cortisol reduces bone formation, favoring long-term development of osteoporosis (progressive bone disease). The mechanism behind this is two-fold: cortisol stimulates the production of RANKL by osteoblasts which stimulates, through binding to RANK receptors, the activity of osteoclasts – cells responsible for calcium resorption from bone – and also inhibits the production of osteoprotegerin (OPG) which acts as a decoy receptor and captures some RANKL before it can activate the osteoclasts through RANK. In other words, when RANKL binds to OPG, no response occurs as opposed to the binding to RANK which leads to the activation of osteoclasts. It transports potassium out of cells in exchange for an equal number of sodium ions (see above). This can trigger the hyperkalemia of metabolic shock from surgery. Cortisol also reduces calcium absorption in the intestine. Cortisol down-regulates the synthesis of collagen. ==== Amino acid ==== Cortisol raises the free amino acids in the serum by inhibiting collagen formation, decreasing amino acid uptake by muscle, and inhibiting protein synthesis. Cortisol (as opticortinol) may inversely inhibit IgA precursor cells in the intestines of calves. Cortisol also inhibits IgA in serum, as it does IgM; however, it is not shown to inhibit IgE. === Electrolyte balance === Cortisol increases glomerular filtration rate, and renal plasma flow from the kidneys thus increasing phosphate excretion, as well as increasing sodium and water retention and potassium excretion by acting on mineralocorticoid receptors. It also increases sodium and water absorption and potassium excretion in the intestines. ==== Sodium ==== Cortisol promotes sodium absorption through the small intestine of mammals. Sodium depletion, however, does not affect cortisol levels so cortisol cannot be used to regulate serum sodium. Cortisol's original purpose may have been sodium transport. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that freshwater fish use cortisol to stimulate sodium inward, while saltwater fish have a cortisol-based system for expelling excess sodium. ==== Potassium ==== A sodium load augments the intense potassium excretion by cortisol. Corticosterone is comparable to cortisol in this case. For potassium to move out of the cell, cortisol moves an equal number of sodium ions into the cell. This should make pH regulation much easier (unlike the normal potassium-deficiency situation, in which two sodium ions move in for each three potassium ions that move out—closer to the deoxycorticosterone effect). === Stomach and kidneys === Cortisol stimulates gastric-acid secretion. Cortisol's only direct effect on the hydrogen-ion excretion of the kidneys is to stimulate the excretion of ammonium ions by deactivating the renal glutaminase enzyme. === Memory === Cortisol works with adrenaline (epinephrine) to create memories of short-term emotional events; this is the proposed mechanism for storage of flash bulb memories, and may originate as a means to remember what to avoid in the future. However, long-term exposure to cortisol damages cells in the hippocampus; this damage results in impaired learning. === Diurnal cycles === Diurnal cycles of cortisol levels are found in humans. === Stress === Sustained stress can lead to high levels of circulating cortisol (regarded as one of the more important of the several \"stress hormones\"). === Effects during pregnancy === During human pregnancy, increased fetal production of cortisol between weeks 30 and 32 initiates production of fetal lung pulmonary surfactant to promote maturation of the lungs. In fetal lambs, glucocorticoids (principally cortisol) increase after about day 130, with lung surfactant increasing greatly, in response, by about day 135, and although lamb fetal cortisol is mostly of maternal origin during the first 122 days, 88% or more is of fetal origin by day 136 of gestation. Although the timing of fetal cortisol concentration elevation in sheep may vary somewhat, it averages about 11.8 days before the onset of labor. In several livestock species (e.g. cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs), the surge of fetal cortisol late in gestation triggers the onset of parturition by removing the progesterone block of cervical dilation and myometrial contraction. The mechanisms yielding this effect on progesterone differ among species. In the sheep, where progesterone sufficient for maintaining pregnancy is produced by the placenta after about day 70 of gestation, the prepartum fetal cortisol surge induces placental enzymatic conversion of progesterone to estrogen. (The elevated level of estrogen stimulates prostaglandin secretion and oxytocin receptor development.) Exposure of fetuses to cortisol during gestation can have a variety of developmental outcomes, including alterations in prenatal and postnatal growth patterns. In marmosets, a species of New World primates, pregnant females have varying levels of cortisol during gestation, both within and between females. Infants born to mothers with high gestational cortisol during the first trimester of pregnancy had lower rates of growth in body mass indices than infants born to mothers with low gestational cortisol (about 20% lower). However, postnatal growth rates in these high-cortisol infants were more rapid than low-cortisol infants later in postnatal periods, and complete catch-up in growth had occurred by 540 days of age. These results suggest that gestational exposure to cortisol in fetuses has important potential fetal programming effects on both pre and postnatal growth in primates. === Cortisol face === Increased cortisol levels may lead to facial swelling and bloating, creating a round and puffy appearance, referred to as \"cortisol face.\" == Synthesis and release == Cortisol is produced in the human body by the adrenal gland's zona fasciculata, the second of three layers comprising the adrenal cortex. This cortex forms the outer \"bark\" of each adrenal gland, situated atop the kidneys. The release of cortisol is controlled by the hypothalamus of a brain. Secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone by the hypothalamus triggers cells in its neighboring anterior pituitary to secrete adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) into the vascular system, through which blood carries it to the adrenal cortex. ACTH stimulates the synthesis of cortisol and other glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoid aldosterone, and dehydroepiandrosterone. == Testing of individuals == Normal values indicated in the following tables pertain to humans (normal levels vary among species). Measured cortisol levels, and therefore reference ranges, depend on the sample type, analytical method used, and factors such as age and sex. Test results should, therefore, always be interpreted using the reference range from the laboratory that produced the result. An individual's cortisol levels can be detected in blood, serum, urine, saliva, and sweat. Using the molecular weight of 362.460 g/mole, the conversion factor from μg/dL to nmol/L is approximately 27.6; thus, 10 μg/dL is about 276 nmol/L. Cortisol follows a circadian rhythm, and to accurately measure cortisol levels is best to test four times per day through saliva. An individual may have normal total cortisol but have a lower than normal level during a certain period of the day and a higher than normal level during a different period. Therefore, some scholars question the clinical utility of cortisol measurement. Cortisol is lipophilic, and is transported bound to transcortin (also known as corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG)) and albumin, while only a small part of the total serum cortisol is unbound and has biological activity. This binding of cortisol to transcortin is accomplished through hydrophobic interactions in which cortisol binds in a 1:1 ratio. Serum cortisol assays measures total cortisol, and its results may be misleading for patients with altered serum protein concentrations. The salivary cortisol test avoids this problem because only free cortisol can pass through the blood-saliva barrier. Transcortin particles are too large to pass through this barrier, that consists of epithelial cell layers of the oral mucosa and salivary glands. Cortisol may be incorporated into hair from blood, sweat, and sebum. A 3 centimeter segment of scalp hair can represent 3 months of hair growth, although growth rates can vary in different regions of the scalp. Cortisol in hair is a reliable indicator of chronic cortisol exposure. Automated immunoassays lack specificity and show significant cross-reactivity due to interactions with structural analogs of cortisol, and show differences between assays. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) can improve specificity and sensitivity. == Disorders of cortisol production == Some medical disorders are related to abnormal cortisol production, such as: Primary hypercortisolism (Cushing's syndrome): excessive levels of cortisol Secondary hypercortisolism (pituitary tumor resulting in Cushing's disease, pseudo-Cushing's syndrome) Primary hypocortisolism (Addison's disease, Nelson's syndrome): insufficient levels of cortisol Secondary hypocortisolism (pituitary tumor, Sheehan's syndrome) == Regulation == The primary control of cortisol is the pituitary gland peptide, ACTH, which probably controls cortisol by controlling the movement of calcium into the cortisol-secreting target cells. ACTH is in turn controlled by the hypothalamic peptide corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which is under nervous control. CRH acts synergistically with arginine vasopressin, angiotensin II, and epinephrine. (In swine, which do not produce arginine vasopressin, lysine vasopressin acts synergistically with CRH.) When activated macrophages start to secrete IL-1, which synergistically with CRH increases ACTH, T-cells also secrete glucosteroid response modifying factor (GRMF), as well as IL-1; both increase the amount of cortisol required to inhibit almost all the immune cells. Immune cells then assume their own regulation, but at a higher cortisol setpoint. The increase in cortisol in diarrheic calves is minimal over healthy calves, however, and falls over time. The cells do not lose all their fight-or-flight override because of interleukin-1's synergism with CRH. Cortisol even has a negative feedback effect on interleukin-1—especially useful to treat diseases that force the hypothalamus to secrete too much CRH, such as those caused by endotoxic bacteria. The suppressor immune cells are not affected by GRMF, so the immune cells' effective setpoint may be even higher than the setpoint for physiological processes. GRMF affects primarily the liver (rather than the kidneys) for some physiological processes. High-potassium media (which stimulates aldosterone secretion in vitro) also stimulate cortisol secretion from the fasciculata zone of canine adrenals — unlike corticosterone, upon which potassium has no effect. Potassium loading also increases ACTH and cortisol in humans. This is probably the reason why potassium deficiency causes cortisol to decline (as mentioned) and causes a decrease in conversion of 11-deoxycortisol to cortisol. This may also have a role in rheumatoid-arthritis pain; cell potassium is always low in RA. Ascorbic acid presence, particularly in high doses has also been shown to mediate response to psychological stress and speed the decrease of the levels of circulating cortisol in the body post-stress. This can be evidenced through a decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressures and decreased salivary cortisol levels after treatment with ascorbic acid. === Factors increasing cortisol levels === Viral infections increase cortisol levels through activation of the HPA axis by cytokines. Intense (high VO2 max) or prolonged aerobic exercise transiently increases cortisol levels to increase gluconeogenesis and maintain blood glucose; however, cortisol declines to normal levels after eating (i.e., restoring a neutral energy balance). Severe trauma or stressful events can elevate cortisol levels in the blood for prolonged periods. Low-carbohydrate diets cause a short-term increase in resting cortisol (≈3 weeks), and increase the cortisol response to aerobic exercise in the short- and long-term. Increase in the concentration of ghrelin, the hunger stimulating hormone, increases levels of cortisol. == Biochemistry == === Biosynthesis === Cortisol is synthesized from cholesterol. Synthesis takes place in the zona fasciculata of an adrenal cortex. The name \"cortisol\" is derived from the word 'cortex'. Cortex means \"the outer layer\"—a reference to the adrenal cortex, the part of the adrenal gland where cortisol is produced. While the adrenal cortex in humans also produces aldosterone in the zona glomerulosa and some sex hormones in the zona reticularis, cortisol is its main secretion in humans and several other species. In cattle, corticosterone levels may approach or exceed cortisol levels. In humans, the medulla of the adrenal gland lies under its cortex, mainly secreting the catecholamines adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline (norepinephrine) under sympathetic stimulation. Synthesis of cortisol in the adrenal gland is stimulated by the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland with ACTH; ACTH production is, in turn, stimulated by CRH, which is released by the hypothalamus. ACTH increases the concentration of cholesterol in the inner mitochondrial membrane, via regulation of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein. It also stimulates the main rate-limiting step in cortisol synthesis, in which cholesterol is converted to pregnenolone and catalyzed by Cytochrome P450SCC (side-chain cleavage enzyme). === Metabolism === ==== 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases ==== Cortisol is metabolized reversibly to cortisone by the 11-beta hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase system (11-beta HSD), which consists of two enzymes: 11-beta HSD1 and 11-beta HSD2. The metabolism of cortisol to cortisone involves oxidation of the hydroxyl group at the 11-beta position. ==== A-ring reductases (5alpha- and 5beta-reductases) ==== Cortisol is also metabolized irreversibly into 5-alpha tetrahydrocortisol (5-alpha THF) and 5-beta tetrahydrocortisol (5-beta THF), reactions for which 5-alpha reductase and 5-beta-reductase are the rate-limiting factors, respectively. 5-Beta reductase is also the rate-limiting factor in the conversion of cortisone to tetrahydrocortisone. ==== Cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A monooxygenases ==== Cortisol is also metabolized irreversibly into 6β-hydroxycortisol by cytochrome p450-3A monooxygenases, mainly, CYP3A4. Drugs that induce CYP3A4 may accelerate cortisol clearance. == Chemistry == Cortisol is a naturally occurring pregnane corticosteroid and is also known as 11β,17α,21-trihydroxypregn-4-ene-3,20-dione. == Animals == In animals, cortisol is often used as an indicator of stress and can be measured in blood, saliva, urine, hair, and faeces. == See also == Cortisone, a hormone Cortisol awakening response List of corticosteroids Membrane glucocorticoid receptor == References == == External links == Cortisol MS Spectrum Cortisol: analyte monograph – The Association for Clinical Biochemistry and Laboratory Medicine",

         " Iadademstat is a potent, selective, oral inhibitor of both the enzymatic and scaffolding activities of the transcriptional repressor lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1; also known as KDM1A) that showed promising early activity and safety in a phase 1 trial and strong preclinical synergy with azacitidine in acute myeloid leukaemia cell lines. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the combination of iadademstat and azacitidine for the treatment of adult patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia. The open-label, phase 2a, dose-finding ALICE study was conducted at six hospitals in Spain and enrolled patients aged 18 years or older with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia not eligible for intensive chemotherapy and an ECOG performance status of 0-2. In the dose escalation portion of the trial, patients received a starting dose of iadademstat at 90 μg/m Between Nov 12, 2018, and Sept 30, 2021, 36 patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia were enrolled; the median age was 76 (IQR 74-79) years, all patients were White, 18 (50%) were male, and 18 (50%) were female, and all had intermediate-risk or adverse-risk acute myeloid leukaemia. The median follow-up was 22 (IQR 16-31) months. The most frequent (≥10%) adverse events considered to be related to treatment were decreases in platelet (25 [69%]) and neutrophil (22 [61%]) counts (all grade 3-4) and anaemia (15 [42%]; of which ten [28%] were grade 3-4). Three patients had treatment-related serious adverse events (one fatal grade 5 intracranial haemorrhage, one grade 3 differentiation syndrome, and one grade 3 febrile neutropenia). Based on safety, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data, and efficacy, the recommended phase 2 dose of iadademstat was 90 μg/m The combination of iadademstat and azacitidine has a manageable safety profile and shows promising responses in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukaemia, including those with high-risk prognostic factors.

Iadademstat is a novel, highly potent, and selective inhibitor of LSD1 (KDM1A), with preclinical in vitro and in vivo antileukemic activity. This study aimed to determine safety and tolerability of iadademstat as monotherapy in patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia (R/R AML). This phase I, nonrandomized, open-label, dose-escalation (DE), and extension-cohort (EC) trial included patients with R/R AML and evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and preliminary antileukemic activity of this orally bioavailable first-in-class lysine-specific demethylase 1 inhibitor. Twenty-seven patients were treated with iadademstat on days 1 to 5 (5-220 µg/m Iadademstat exhibits a good safety profile together with signs of clinical and biologic activity as a single agent in patients with R/R AML. A phase II trial of iadademstat in combination with azacitidine is ongoing (EudraCT No.: 2018-000482-36). SOX2 is a core pluripotency-associated transcription factor causally related to cancer initiation, aggressiveness, and drug resistance by driving the self-renewal and seeding capacity of cancer stem cells (CSC). Here, we tested the ability of the clinically proven inhibitor of the lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1A) iadademstat (ORY-100) to target SOX2-driven CSC in breast cancer. Iadademstat blocked CSC-driven mammosphere formation in breast cancer cell lines that are dependent on SOX2 expression to maintain their CSC phenotype. Iadademstat prevented the activation of an LSD1-targeted stemness-specific SOX2 enhancer in CSC-enriched 3-dimensional spheroids. Using high-throughput transcriptional data available from the METABRIC dataset, high expression of SOX2 was significantly more common in luminal-B and HER2-enriched subtypes according to PAM50 classifier and in IntClust1 (high proliferating luminal-B) and IntClust 5 (luminal-B and HER2-amplified) according to integrative clustering. Iadademstat significantly reduced mammospheres formation by CSC-like cells from a multidrug-resistant luminal-B breast cancer patient-derived xenograft but not of those from a treatment-naïve luminal-A patient. Iadademstat reduced the expression of SOX2 in luminal-B but not in luminal-A mammospheres, likely indicating a selective targeting of SOX2-driven CSC. The therapeutic relevance of targeting SOX2-driven breast CSC suggests the potential clinical use of iadademstat as an epigenetic therapy in luminal-B and HER2-positive subtypes.",

         "Ibutilide is a Class III antiarrhythmic agent that is indicated for acute cardioconversion of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter of a recent onset to sinus rhythm. It exerts its antiarrhythmic effect by induction of slow inward sodium current, which prolongs action potential and refractory period of myocardial cells. Because of its Class III antiarrhythmic activity, there should not be concomitant administration of Class Ia and Class III agents. Ibutilide is marketed as Corvert by Pfizer. Administration resulted in successful heart rhythm control in 31–44% of patients within 90 minutes, with sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in 0.9–2.5% of patients. It appears to show better results in atrial flutter as compared to atrial fibrillation. == Mechanism of action == Ibutilide, like other class III antiarrhythmic drugs, blocks delayed rectified potassium current. It does have action on the slow sodium channel and promotes the influx of sodium through these slow channels. Although potassium current seems to play a role, their interactions are complex and not well understood. Ibutilide's unique mechanism works by an activation of a specific inward sodium current, thus producing its therapeutic response in which a prolonged action potential increases myocytes’ cardiac refractoriness in case of atrial fibrillation and flutter. == Pharmacokinetics == === Absorption === Ibutilide is intravenously administered. It has a high first-pass metabolism, which results in a poor bioavailability when taken orally. Individual pharmacokinetic properties are highly viable during the clinical trial. === Distribution === Ibutilide has a relatively large volume of distribution among individual subjects, which is about 11L/kg. Approximately 40% of the drug is bound with plasma albumin of healthy volunteers in a trial. This is also approximately close to patients with atrial fibrillation and flutter. === Metabolism === Ibutilide has a high systemic plasma clearance that closes to the hepatic blood flow (29mL/min/kg). Its metabolic pathway is via liver's cytochrome P450 system by isoenzymes other than CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 by which the heptyl side chain of ibutilide is oxidized. With eight metabolites are detected in the urine, however, only one is an active metabolite that shares the similar electrophysiologic property of the Class III antiarrhythmic agents. The plasma concentration of this metabolite is only less than 10% of ibutilide. === Excretion === After administration of ibutilide, it is quickly excreted by renal pathway with a half-life of approximately 6 hours. Approximately 82% of a 0.01 mg/kg dose is excreted in the urine during the trial. Among those, around 7% is excreted as unchanged drug. The remainder of the drug is excreted in feces (about 19%). == Adverse effects and contraindications == Like other antiarrhythmics, ibutilide can lead to abnormal heart rhythms due to its ability to prolong the QT interval, which can lead to the potentially fatal abnormal heart rhythm known as torsades de pointes. Consequently, the drug is contraindicated in patients that are likely to develop abnormal heart rhythms; this includes individuals who have previously experienced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, have a prolonged QT interval, sick sinus syndrome, or have recently had a myocardial infarction, among other conditions. == Patient Information == This medication will be given intravenously for your heart disease. You will have continuously ECG monitoring during the infusion and 4 hours after your infusion. Some of the minor side effects are headache and irregular heartbeat. If you experience chest pain and respiratory difficulties, you should report to your doctors immediately. == See also == Sematilide Risotilide == References ==",

Sensor 1 is based on ion-association Ns-TPB, sensor 2 used Ns-PT, sensor 3 comprises a mixture of (Ns-PT+Ns-TPB) and sensor 4 was constructed using (Ns-PT+β-CD). Solvent mediator 2-NPPE exhibited a proper behavior including Nernstian slope ranging from 61.5±0.5 to 64.5±0.5 mV per decade over the pH range of 3.8-10 for the four sensors. Linear responses of Ns within the concentration range 1.0×10(-7)-1.0×10(-2) mol/L were obtained. The response time is very short (≤10s) with a detection limit 6.3×10(-8) M. In flow injection analysis (FIA), sensor 3 shows a Nernstian slope value 75.5±0.5 mV per decade within the concentration range of 1×10(-6)-1×10(-2) mol/L and with a detection limit 7.5×10(-7) mol/L. The utility of mixed or additives of β-CD had a significant influence on increasing the sensitivity of sensors 3 and 4 compared to sensors 1 and 2. The sensors were applied for the determination of neostigmine (Ns) ion in its bulk powder, different pharmaceutical dosage forms, and biological fluids (plasma and urine).

         "4-Aminobenzoic acid (also known as para-aminobenzoic acid or PABA because the two functional groups are attached to the benzene ring across from one another in the para position) is an organic compound with the formula H2NC6H4CO2H. PABA is a white crystalline solid, although commercial samples can appear gray. It is slightly soluble in water. It consists of a benzene ring substituted with amino and carboxyl groups. The compound occurs extensively in the natural world. == Production and occurrence == In industry, PABA is prepared mainly by two routes: Reduction of 4-nitrobenzoic acid Hoffman degradation of the monoamide derived from terephthalic acid. Food sources of PABA include liver, brewer's yeast (and unfiltered beer), kidney, molasses, mushrooms, and whole grains. Other food sources of PABA include spinach, liver, and oat seeds. == Biology == === Biochemistry === PABA is an intermediate in the synthesis of folate by bacteria, plants, and fungi. Many bacteria, including those found in the human intestinal tract such as E. coli, generate PABA from chorismate by the combined action of the enzymes 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate synthase and 4-amino-4-deoxychorismate lyase. Plants produce PABA in their chloroplasts, and store it as a glucose ester (pABA-Glc) in their tissues. Humans lack the enzymes to convert PABA to folate and so require folate from dietary sources, such as green leafy vegetables. In humans, PABA is considered nonessential and, although it has been referred to historically as \"vitamin Bx\", is no longer recognized as a vitamin because the typical human gut microbiome generates PABA on its own. Sulfonamide drugs are structurally similar to PABA, and their antibacterial activity is due to their ability to interfere with the conversion of PABA to folate by the enzyme dihydropteroate synthetase. Thus, bacterial growth is limited through folate deficiency. === Medical use === The potassium salt is used as a drug against fibrotic skin disorders, such as Peyronie's disease, under the brand name Potaba. PABA is also occasionally used in pill form by sufferers of irritable bowel syndrome to treat its associated gastrointestinal symptoms, and in nutritional epidemiological studies to assess the completeness of 24-hour urine collection for the determination of urinary sodium, potassium, or nitrogen levels. PABA derivatives have also been proposed to function as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors in diseases that cause deficient cholinergic systems, such as Alzheimer's Disease. === Nutritional supplement === Despite the lack of any recognized syndromes of PABA deficiency in humans, except for those who lack the colonic bacteria that generate PABA, many claims of benefit are made by commercial suppliers of PABA as a nutritional supplement. The benefit is claimed for fatigue, irritability, depression, weeping eczema (moist eczema), scleroderma (premature hardening of the skin), patchy pigment loss in the skin (vitiligo), and premature grey hair. == Commercial and industrial use == PABA finds use in the biomedical sector. Its derivatives are found as a structural component in 1.5% of a database of 12111 commercial drugs. Other uses include its conversion to specialty azo dyes and crosslinking agents. PABA is also used as a biodegradable pesticide, though its use is now limited due to evolution of new variants of bio-pesticides. Specifically, studies have shown that PABA photodegrades through an O2-mediated pathway in which PABA is oxidized by O2 via hydrogen abstraction and decarboxylation. In the past, PABA was widely used in sunscreens as a UV filter. It is a UVB absorber, meaning it can absorb wavelengths between 290 and 320 nm. while still allowing UVA wavelengths between 320-400 nm to pass through, producing a tan. The chemical structure of PABA, with the amino and carboxyl groups being para to each other, allows for easy electron delocalization, which reduces the gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). This makes it easier for the electrons in PABA to transition to a higher energy state upon absorbing light. Patented in 1943, PABA was one of the first active ingredients to be used in sunscreen. The first in vivo studies on mice showed that PABA reduced UV damage. In addition, it was shown to protect against skin tumors in rodents, as shown by a 1975 study ran by Dr. Diane Sekura Snyder and Dr. Marian May. However, animal and in vitro studies in the early 1980s suggested PABA might increase the risk of cellular UV damage. On the basis of these studies, as well as problems with allergies and clothing discoloration, PABA fell out of favor as a sunscreen. In 2008 it was banned as a sunscreen ingredient in the European Union and in 2019 the FDA proposed its limited use. However, water-insoluble PABA derivatives such as padimate O are currently used in some cosmetic products including mascara, concealer, and matte lipsticks. As of 2008, the advancement of new sunscreen is focused on developing a broad spectrum of active ingredients that provide consistent protection across all wavelengths, including UVA. Researchers are considering the PABA–TiO2 Hybrid Nanostructures that result from the method of aqueous in situ synthesis with PABA and TiO2. == Safety considerations == PABA is largely nontoxic; the median lethal dose of PABA in dogs (oral) is 2 g/kg. Allergic reactions, specifically Allergic Contact Dermatitis and Photocontact Dermatitis, to PABA can occur. It is formed in the metabolism of certain ester local anesthetics, and many allergic reactions to local anesthetics are the result of reactions to PABA. == References ==",

         "Fimasartan is a non-peptide angiotensin II receptor antagonist (ARB) used for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure. Through oral administration, fimasartan blocks angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1 receptors), reducing pro-hypertensive actions of angiotensin II, such as systemic vasoconstriction and water retention by the kidneys. Concurrent administration of fimasartan with diuretic hydrochlorothiazide has shown to be safe in clinical trials. Fimasartan was approved for use in South Korea on September 9, 2010, and is available under the brand name Kanarb through Boryung Pharmaceuticals, who are presently seeking worldwide partnership. == Mechanism of action == Fimasartan acts on the kidney's rennin-angiotensin cascade, which begins when renin release from the kidney causes the breakdown of angiotensinogen into angiotensin I. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) then catalyzes the reaction that forms angiotensin II, which acts on AT1 receptors on the blood vessels, heart, and kidneys. On blood vessels, the AT1 receptor is coupled to an intracellular pathway that causes smooth muscle contraction (vasoconstriction) of blood vessels. In blocking the AT1 receptor, fimasartan inhibits vasoconstriction, favouring vasodilation. At the kidney and adrenal gland, AT1 blockage and prevention of aldosterone formation increase excretion of water and salt by the kidneys, which decreases overall blood volume. At the heart, AT1 blockage decreases contractility and the stimulatory effects of the sympathetic nervous system. Collectively, fimasartain leads to a reduction in blood pressure and alleviation of hypertensive symptoms. ARBs like fimasartan have also shown to be protective against stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure. Fimasartan has been shown to reduce cardiac hypertrophy, fibrosis, remodelling, and unnecessary cell proliferation via blockage of AT1 activation conceivably through decreased Endothelin 1 production, a result of AT1 activation. Fimastartan can also block TGF-β1 production (also AT1 dependent), which contributes to fibrosis and ventricular damage post-infarct. After ARB administration, mice showed improved prognosis after a myocardial infarction, though further studies still need to be done to assess fimasartan's specific effects on decreasing cardiovascular damage. == Side effects == Side effects In clinical trials, fimasartan was well tolerated in all patients. However, higher dosing (360 mg/day) was accompanied by increased dizziness (most likely due to the momentary decrease in blood pressure) and headaches in a low number of patients. Other side effects such as diarrhea, syncope, and cold feet were also experienced in a low number of subjects, which all resolved without medical intervention. == Pharmacology == Fimasartan is rapidly absorbed and has minimal accumulation in the body 7 days after administration. Fimasartan possesses a half-life of 9 to 16 hours, appropriate for daily dosing. Fimasartan was found to be effective in fasted or fed states, with a variety of dosing regimens. In trials, the maximum effects of the drug occurred slightly after the maximum plasma concentration (T-max) was achieved, which occurs 30 minutes to 3 hours after dosing. Fimasartan was found mostly in unmetabolized form in the plasma and in bile excretions. Urinary elimination of the drug was low, at less than 3% 24 hours after administration, entailing that the fimasartan does not undergo renal excretion. == Society and culture == === Brand names === The drug is also available in Russia as Канарб (Kanarb). Fimasartan is being marketed in India under the brand name of Fimanta and Fimagen through Ajanta Pharma Ltd. == References ==",

It was patented in 1987 and approved for medical use in 1997. == Medical uses == Naratriptan is used for the treatment of the acute migraine attacks and the symptoms of migraine, including severe, throbbing headaches that sometimes are accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to sound or light. === Efficacy === A meta-analysis of 53 clinical trials has shown that all triptans are effective for treating migraine at marketed doses and that naratriptan, although less effective than sumatriptan and rizatriptan was more effective than placebo in reducing migraine symptoms at two hours and efficacy was demonstrated in almost two thirds of subjects after four hours of treatment. == Side effects == Side effects are similar to other triptan medications, with the incidence of side effects reportedly being lower than sumatriptan, and side effects occurring rarely except when above 2.5mg. The risk of triptan side effects is also in general low, according to a systematic review. Side effects include: sensations of warmth/heat, dizziness, drowsiness, tingling of the hands or feet, nausea, dry mouth and unsteadiness, chest pain/pressure, throat pain/pressure, unusually fast/slow/irregular pulse, and mental/mood changes. The tingling and heaviness and sensation of warmth/heat is characteristic of selective 5-HT1 agonists. == Mechanism of action == The causes of migraine are not clearly understood; however, the efficacy of naratriptans and other triptans is believed to be due to their activity as 5-HT (serotonin) agonists. The biological and pharmacokinetic profile of naratriptan differs significantly from sumatriptan. == Society and culture == In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved naratriptan on February 11, 1998. It was covered by U.S. Patent no. 4997841; the FDA lists the patent as expiring on July 7, 2010. In July 2010, in the wake of the patent expiration, several drug manufacturers, including Roxane Labs, Sandoz and Teva Pharmaceuticals, announced that they were launching generic Naratriptan medications. The drug continued to be covered by European patent 0303507 in Germany, Spain, France and the United Kingdom through March 10, 2012, and by Australian patent 611469 in Australia through June 17, 2013. It had previously been covered by Canadian patent 1210968; but both Sandoz and Teva (formerly Novopharm) have offered generic equivalents in Canada since that patent's expiration December 1, 2009. On December 23, 2014, in response to a request from Health Canada, importers in Canada agreed to quarantine the importation of health products, including generic Naratriptan manufactured for both Sandoz and Teva, from Dr. Reddy's Laboratories in Srikakulam, India. Because Teva and Sandoz are the only approved suppliers of generic Naratriptan in Canada, the quarantine resulted in Naratriptan being placed on the Canadian drug shortage list. Following the Canadian quarantine, the United Arab Emirates' Ministry of Health also imposed a similar quarantine. == References ==",

         " The bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) protein BRD2-4 inhibitors hold therapeutic promise in preclinical models of hematologic malignancies. However, translation of these data to molecules suitable for clinical development has yet to be accomplished. Herein we expand the mechanistic understanding of BET inhibitors in multiple myeloma by using the chemical probe molecule I-BET151. I-BET151 induces apoptosis and exerts strong antiproliferative effect in vitro and in vivo. This is associated with contrasting effects on oncogenic MYC and HEXIM1, an inhibitor of the transcriptional activator P-TEFb. I-BET151 causes transcriptional repression of MYC and MYC-dependent programs by abrogating recruitment to the chromatin of the P-TEFb component CDK9 in a BRD2-4-dependent manner. In contrast, transcriptional upregulation of HEXIM1 is BRD2-4 independent. Finally, preclinical studies show that I-BET762 has a favorable pharmacologic profile as an oral agent and that it inhibits myeloma cell proliferation, resulting in survival advantage in a systemic myeloma xenograft model. These data provide a strong rationale for extending the clinical testing of the novel antimyeloma agent I-BET762 and reveal insights into biologic pathways required for myeloma cell proliferation. As one of the most fatal malignancies, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has significant resistance to the currently available treatment approaches. Gemcitabine, the standard chemotherapeutic agent for locally advanced and metastatic PDAC, has limited efficacy, which is attributed to innate/acquired resistance and the activation of prosurvival pathways. Here, we investigated the in vitro efficacy of I-BET762, an inhibitor of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family of proteins, in treating PDAC cell lines alone and in combination with gemcitabine (GEM). The effect of these two agents was also examined in xenograft PDAC tumors in mice. We found that I-BET762 induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase and cell death and suppressed cell proliferation and metastatic stem cell factors in PDAC cells. In addition, the BH3-only protein Bim, which is related to chemotherapy resistance, was upregulated by I-BET762, which increased the cell death triggered by GEM in PDAC cells. Moreover, GEM and I-BET762 exerted a synergistic effect on cytotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, Bim is necessary for I-BET762 activity and modulates the synergistic effect of GEM and I-BET762 in PDAC. In conclusion, we investigated the effect of I-BET762 on PDAC and suggest an innovative strategy for PDAC treatment.",

         " Molibresib is a selective, small molecule inhibitor of the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) protein family. This was an open-label, two-part, Phase I/II study investigating molibresib monotherapy for the treatment of hematological malignancies (NCT01943851). Part 1 (dose escalation) determined the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of molibresib in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), or multiple myeloma. Part 2 (dose expansion) investigated the safety and efficacy of molibresib at the RP2D in patients with relapsed/refractory myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; as well as AML evolved from antecedent MDS) or cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). The primary endpoint in Part 1 was safety and the primary endpoint in Part 2 was objective response rate (ORR). There were 111 patients enrolled (87 in Part 1, 24 in Part 2). Molibresib RP2Ds of 75 mg daily (for MDS) and 60 mg daily (for CTCL) were selected. Most common Grade 3+ adverse events included thrombocytopenia (37%), anemia (15%), and febrile neutropenia (15%). Six patients achieved complete responses [3 in Part 1 (2 AML, 1 NHL), 3 in Part 2 (MDS)], and 7 patients achieved partial responses [6 in Part 1 (4 AML, 2 NHL), 1 in Part 2 (MDS)]. The ORRs for Part 1, Part 2, and the total study population were 10% [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.8-18.7], 25% (95% CI, 7.3-52.4), and 13% (95% CI, 6.9-20.6), respectively. While antitumor activity was observed with molibresib, use was limited by gastrointestinal and thrombocytopenia toxicities. Investigations of molibresib as part of combination regimens may be warranted. Molibresib (GSK525762), an orally bioavailable small molecule with 2 major equipotent active metabolites, is being developed for the treatment of cancers. Molibresib is a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). To enable administering safe doses of molibresib to healthy volunteers, this 2-part randomized, open-label, crossover drug-drug interaction trial was conducted as an adaptive design study using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling and simulation to predict the lowest doses of molibresib that could be safely administered alone (10 mg) or with itraconazole and rifampicin (strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A and P-gp, respectively). PBPK simulation guided the molibresib dose (5 mg) to be administered along with itraconazole in part 1. Itraconazole increased total exposure (AUC) of molibresib by 4.15-fold with a 66% increase in C Molibresib (GSK525762) is an investigational, orally bioavailable, small-molecule bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) protein inhibitor for the treatment of advanced solid tumors. Molibresib was initially evaluated in a first-time-in-human (FTIH) study BET115521 consisting of two parts: Part 1 of the study (dose escalation) was conducted in 94 patients with nuclear protein in testis midline carcinoma and other solid tumors, and Part 2 (expansion cohort) was conducted in 99 patients with different solid tumor types. Molibresib is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 enzymes to produce two major active metabolites that are equipotent to the parent molecule. The metabolites are measured together after full conversion of one to the other and reported as an active metabolite composite (GSK3529246). The molibresib pharmacokinetic (PK) profile has been characterized by a decrease in exposure over time, with the decrease more pronounced at higher doses, and accompanied by a slight increase of the metabolite concentrations. Autoinduction of molibresib metabolism was suspected and confirmed in vitro. Here we report the development of a semimechanistic liver-compartment population PK model using PK data from the FTIH study, which adequately describes the autoinduction of molibresib clearance and the PK of both molibresib and GSK3529246. Covariate analysis indicated body weight had a significant effect on the volume of distribution of molibresib and GSK3529246, and higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase resulted in the lower clearance of GSK3529246. This model was used to simulate individual patient exposures based on covariate information for use in future alternative dosing strategies and exposure-response analyses.",

         " Many factors contribute to inadequate diversity in Alzheimer disease (AD) clinical trials. We evaluated eligibility rates among racial and ethnic groups at US sites in large global multisite trials in early AD. Using screening data from 4 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in early AD, we assessed rates of eligibility among racial and ethnic groups controlling for other demographic covariates. Each trial incorporated positron emission tomography and/or cerebrospinal fluid to evaluate brain amyloid pathology, as well as typical eligibility criteria used in early AD trials. Across the trials, 10,804 US participants were screened: 193 (2%) were of Hispanic ethnicity and Black race, 2,624 (25%) were of Hispanic ethnicity and White race, 118 (1%) were of non-Hispanic ethnicity (NH) and Asian race, 696 (7%) were of NH ethnicity and Black race, and 7,017 (65%) were of NH ethnicity and White race. Data from 156 participants who did not fit into these categories were excluded. Accounting for age, sex, and trial and using NH White participants as a reference group, we observed higher probabilities of ineligibility for amyloid biomarker criteria among Hispanic Black (odds ratio [OR] = 3.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.11-4.88), Hispanic White (OR = 4.15, 95% CI = 3.58-4.83), NH Asian (OR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.23-4.55), and NH Black (OR = 3.75, 95% CI = 2.80-5.06) participants. Differential eligibility may contribute to underrepresentation of some minoritized racial and ethnic groups in early AD trials. Amyloid biomarker eligibility is a requirement to confirm the diagnosis of AD and for treatment with amyloid-lowering drugs and differed among racial and ethnic groups. ANN NEUROL 2024;95:288-298. Elenbecestat, an oral BACE-1 inhibitor that has been shown to reduce Aβ levels in cerebrospinal fluid, was investigated in two global phase 3 studies in early AD. Here we report on differences observed in characteristics of APOE ε4 and amyloid positive subjects in the large screening cohort. Screening was performed in 5 sequential tiers over a maximum of 80 days, as part of placebo controlled, double blind phase 3 studies. Subjects were evaluated at sites in 7 regions (29 countries). Overall, 9758 subjects were screened. All screened subjects that were eligible received either placebo or 50 mg QID elenbecestat post randomisation. Gender, disease staging, APOE ε4 status, amyloid status, amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) standard uptake value ratio (SUVr) and amyloid PET Centiloid (CL) values were determined for screened subjects; by country and region. In this program, 44% of subjects were APOE ε4 positive. Frequency of females was similar in both APOE ε4 positive and negative groups. However, early mild AD subjects were slightly higher in the APOE ε4 positive group compared with the APOE ε4 negative group. 56% of subjects were amyloid positive. The mean age in the amyloid positive group was slightly higher than the amyloid negative group. The gender distribution was similar between amyloid groups. A lower number of mild cognitive impairment was observed in the amyloid positive group along with a higher number of early mild AD. APOE ε4 positive subjects were higher in amyloid positive group compared to the amyloid negative group. China had the lowest APOE ε4 and amyloid positivity rates with Western Europe and Oceania performing best. Subjects received florbetapir, florbetaben or flutemetamol amyloid PET tracer. Amyloid negative and positive subjects CL values were normally distributed around their respective means of 1.5 CL and 83 CL. However, there was an appreciable overlap in the 20-40 CL range. In this large cohort of cognitively impaired subjects, subject demographics characteristics were comparable regardless of APOE genotype or amyloid positivity. APOE ε4 positivity and amyloid positivity varied by country and by geographical region.",

The compound elicited a short-lasting suppressive effect when applied after immunisation; the number of PFC decreased two days after treatment while 5 days after drug administration increased as compared to the untreated animals. Treatment prior to immunisation proved to be ineffective. The titre of circulating antibodies showed changes similar although of lesser extent. Five days following treatment marked infiltration of plasmacytes was present in the axillary lymph nodes. Rats bearing transplantable Guérin tumor showed similar changes in immune response as the tumor free animals following DAD treatment. Mice 2--4 days of age were pretreated with a single 5 mg/kg dose of dianhydrodulcitol (DAD) and later infected intracerebrally with lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus. These animals had a lower mortality rate and died later than the untreated control animals. Thus DAD pretreatment prevented in part of the animals the development of lethal meningitis, the consequence of LCM virus infection, reducing the cellular immune response. This effect of DAD could equally be observed in animals infected at the age of 16--18 days and of 4 weeks. The incorporation of 3H-Dibromodulcitol and 3H-Dianhydrodulcitol into S37 ascites tumor cells has been studied with autoradiography. Both drugs war incorporated very rapidly into the cells. The labeling of nucleus was higher than that of cytoplasm. A slight accumulation of grains was found above the condensed chromatin and along the membranes.

         "Erlotinib, sold under the brand name Tarceva among others, is a medication used to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic cancer. Specifically it is used for NSCLC with mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) — either an exon 19 deletion (del19) or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutation — which has spread to other parts of the body. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include rash, diarrhea, muscle pain, joint pain, and cough. Serious side effects may include lung problems, kidney problems, liver failure, gastrointestinal perforation, stroke, and corneal ulceration. Use in pregnancy may harm the baby. It is a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which acts on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Erlotinib was approved for medical use in the United States in 2004. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == === Lung cancer === Erlotinib in unresectable non-small cell lung cancer when added to chemotherapy improves overall survival by 19%, and improved progression-free survival (PFS) by 29%, when compared to chemotherapy alone. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved erlotinib for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer that has failed at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. In lung cancer, erlotinib has been shown to be effective in patients with or without EGFR mutations, but appears to be more effective in patients with EGFR mutations. Overall survival, progression-free survival and one-year survival are similar to standard second-line therapy (docetaxel or pemetrexed). Overall response rate is about 50% better than standard second-line chemotherapy. Patients who are non-smokers, and light former smokers, with adenocarcinoma or subtypes like BAC are more likely to have EGFR mutations, but mutations can occur in all types of patients. A test for the EGFR mutation has been developed by Genzyme. === Pancreatic cancer === In November 2005, the FDA approved erlotinib in combination with gemcitabine for treatment of locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic pancreatic cancer. === Resistance to treatment === As with other ATP competitive small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib in CML, patients rapidly develop resistance. In the case of erlotinib this typically occurs 8–12 months from the start of treatment. Over 50% of resistance is caused by a mutation in the ATP binding pocket of the EGFR kinase domain involving substitution of a small polar threonine residue with a large nonpolar methionine residue (T790M). Approximately 20% of drug resistance is caused by amplification of the hepatocyte growth factor receptor, which drives ERBB3 dependent activation of PI3K. == Side effects == === Common === Rash occurs in the majority of patients. This resembles acne and primarily involves the face and neck. It is self-limited and resolves in the majority of cases, even with continued use. Some clinical studies have indicated a correlation between the severity of the skin reactions and increased survival though this has not been quantitatively assessed. The Journal of Clinical Oncology reported in 2004 that \"cutaneous [skin] rash seems to be a surrogate marker of clinical benefit, but this finding should be confirmed in ongoing and future studies.\" The newsletter Lung Cancer Frontiers reported in its October 2003 issue, \"Patients with moderate to severe cutaneous reactions [rashes] have a far better survival, than those with only mild reactions and much better than those with no cutaneous manifestations of drug effects.\" Diarrhea Loss of appetite Fatigue Partial hair loss (by strands, not typically in clumps) === Rare === interstitial pneumonitis, which is characterized by cough and increased dyspnea. This may be severe and must be considered among those patients whose breathing acutely worsens. ingrown hairs, such as eyelashes gastrointestinal tract toxicity serious or fatal gastrointestinal tract perforations skin toxicity bullous, blistering, and exfoliative skin conditions (some fatal) Stevens–Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis ocular disorders corneal lesions Pulmonary toxicity interstitial pneumonitis bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP) pulmonary fibrosis fatal asymmetric interstitial lung disease == Interactions == Erlotinib is not a substrate for either of hepatic OATPs (OATP1B1 or OATP1B3). Also, erlotinib is not an inhibitor of OATP-1B1 or OATP-1B3 transporter. Erlotinib is mainly metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4. Compounds which induce this enzyme (i.e. stimulate its production), such as St John's wort, can lower erlotinib concentrations, while inhibitors can increase concentrations. == Mechanism == Erlotinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor (EGFR inhibitor). The drug follows Iressa (gefitinib), which was the first drug of this type. Erlotinib specifically targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase, which is highly expressed and occasionally mutated in various forms of cancer. It binds in a reversible fashion to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site of the receptor. For the signal to be transmitted, two EGFR molecules need to come together to form a homodimer. These then use the molecule of ATP to trans-phosphorylate each other on tyrosine residues, which generates phosphotyrosine residues, recruiting the phosphotyrosine-binding proteins to EGFR to assemble protein complexes that transduce signal cascades to the nucleus or activate other cellular biochemical processes. When erlotinib binds to EGFR, formation of phosphotyrosine residues in EGFR is not possible and the signal cascades are not initiated. == Society and culture == It is marketed in the United States by Genentech and OSI Pharmaceuticals and elsewhere by Roche. The drug's U.S. patent expired in 2020. In May 2012, the US District Court of Delaware passed an order in favor of OSI Pharmaceutical LLC against Mylan Pharmaceuticals upholding the validity of the patent for Erlotinib. In India, generic pharmaceutical firm Cipla is battling with Roche against the Indian patent for this drug. == References == == External links == \"Erlotinib\". National Cancer Institute.",

We examined the protective effects and possible mechanism of action of E3330 in three different endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide)-induced murine hepatitis models, in which tumor necrosis factor is suggested to play a critical role in the pathogenesis. One of these models was induced by i.v. injection of lipopolysaccharide in combination with D-galactosamine to mice. Oral pretreatment with E3330 improved the survival rate and attenuated the increase in plasma aminotransferase activities of the survivors. The other two models were induced by i.v. injection of lipopolysaccharide or a mixture of D-galactosamine and lipopolysaccharide in Propionibacterium acnes-primed mice. In both of these models, tumor necrosis factor was detected in the plasma within 3 hr of the injection. Oral pretreatment with E3330 attenuated the elevation of plasma tumor necrosis factor activity and protected mice from liver injury. Furthermore, E3330 inhibited the production of tumor necrosis factor from cultured Propionibacterium acnes-elicited murine peritoneal macrophages on stimulation with lipopolysaccharide in vitro.

         "Ulotaront (INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name; developmental codes SEP-363856, SEP-856) is an investigational antipsychotic that is undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease psychosis. The medication was discovered in collaboration between PsychoGenics Inc. and Sunovion Pharmaceuticals (which was subsequently merged into Sumitomo Pharma) using PsychoGenics' behavior and AI-based phenotypic drug discovery platform, SmartCube. Ulotaront is in phase III clinical trial for schizophrenia, phase II/III for generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder, and discontinued for narcolepsy and psychotic disorders. Research has shown that ulotaront results in a greater reduction from baseline in the PANSS total score than placebo. Treatment with ulotaront, as compared with placebo, was also associated with an improvement in sleep quality. Ulotaront was awarded a Breakthrough Therapy designation due to its increased efficacy and greatly reduced side effects compared to current treatments. == Adverse effects == Some adverse events reported in preliminary clinical trials are somnolence, agitation, nausea, diarrhea, and dyspepsia. The adverse effect profile of ulotaront differs from that of other antipsychotics because its mechanism of action does not involve antagonism of dopamine receptors in the brain, which is responsible for the drug-induced movement disorders (like akathisia) that may occur with those agents. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === The mechanism of action of ulotaront in the treatment of schizophrenia is unclear. However, it is thought to be an agonist at the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors. This mechanism of action is unique among available antipsychotics, which generally antagonize dopamine receptors (especially dopamine D2 receptor). Ulotaront is a full agonist of the human TAAR1 with an EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration of 140 nM and an EmaxTooltip maximal efficacy of 101.3%. It is also a partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor (EC50 = 2,300 nM; Emax = 74.7%) and of the serotonin 5-HT1D receptor (EC50 = 262 nM; Emax = 57.1%). Conversely, its activities at various other targets, such as various other serotonin receptors as well as adrenergic and dopamine receptors, are much less potent. Ulotaront decreases basal locomotor activity in rodents and this effect was absent in TAAR1 knockout mice. It prevented the hyperlocomotion induced by the NMDA receptor antagonist phencyclidine (PCP). Conversely, ulotaront did not affect dextroamphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion. Similarly, it did not reverse apomorphine-induced climbing behavior. === Pharmacokinetics === The precise pharmacokinetic profile of ulotaront has not been reported, though the developer has suggested that the pharmacokinetic data supports once daily dosing. == Research == As of 2018, Sunovion, the maker of another antipsychotic called lurasidone (Latuda), is conducting clinical trials on ulotaront in partnership with the preclinical research company PsychoGenics. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted ulotaront the breakthrough therapy designation. In addition to schizophrenia, ulotaront is also being studied for the treatment of psychosis associated with Parkinson's disease. The Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS) has been used to assess the effect of Ulotaront on the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. In July 2023, the pharmaceutical company behind the drug announced that the drug had failed to outperform placebo in the treatment of acutely psychotic patients with schizophrenia, as measured by the PANSS. == See also == List of investigational antipsychotics § Monoamine receptor modulators Ralmitaront == References ==",

         "Butenafine, sold under the brand names Lotrimin Ultra, Mentax, and Butop (In India only), is a synthetic benzylamine derived antifungal drug. It is structurally related to the allylamine antifungals terbinafine & naftifine. == Medical uses == Butenafine is indicated for the topical treatment of tinea (pityriasis) versicolor due to Malassezia furfur, as well as athlete's foot (Tinea pedis), ringworm (Tinea corporis) and jock itch (Tinea cruris) due to Epidermophyton floccosum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton rubrum, and Trichophyton tonsurans. It also displays superior activity against Candida albicans than terbinafine and naftifine. Butenafine demonstrates low minimum inhibitory concentrations against Cryptococcus and Aspergillus. There is some evidence that it is effective against dermatophyte infections of the toenails, but needs to be applied daily for prolonged periods (at least one year). === Available forms === Butenafine is typically available as a 1% topical cream. == Pharmacology == Like the allylamine antifungals (e.g terbinafine), butenafine works by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol by binding to and inhibiting squalene epoxidase, an enzyme in the pathway used for creation of the sterols needed in fungal cell membranes. Lacking ergosterol, the cell membranes increase in permeability, allowing their contents to leak out. Furthermore, inhibition of squalene epoxidase leads to a toxic buildup of squalene. This double action of butenafine (increased membrane permeability and toxic buildup of squalene) makes butenafine fungicidal rather than merely fungistatic. In addition to being an antifungal, butenafine is an anti inflammatory. Because fungal skin infections are often accompanied by significant inflammation, this is a desirable property. The fact that butenafine has intrinsic anti inflammatory properties is also desirable since it is not necessary to add topical glucocorticoids, which often come with undesired side effects. == Chemistry == Butenafine hydrochloride is an odorless white crystalline powder that is freely soluble in methanol, ethanol, and chloroform, yet is only slightly soluble in water. == Synthesis == Reductive amination of 1-naphthaldehyde (1) with methylamine (2) gives the intermediate secondary amine (3). Alkylation of this with p-tert-butyl benzyl bromide (4) yields the tertiary amine butenafine. == References ==",

         " To report efficacy and safety of samotolisib (LY3023414; PI3K/mTOR dual kinase and DNA-dependent protein kinase inhibitor) plus enzalutamide in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) following cancer progression on abiraterone. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled phase Ib/II study (NCT02407054), following a lead-in segment for evaluating safety and pharmacokinetics of samotolisib and enzalutamide combination, patients with advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer with progression on prior abiraterone were randomized to receive enzalutamide (160 mg daily)/samotolisib (200 mg twice daily) or placebo. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group criteria (PCWG2). Secondary and exploratory endpoints included radiographic PFS (rPFS) and biomarkers, respectively. Log-rank tests assessed treatment group differences. Overall, 13 and 129 patients were enrolled in phase Ib and II, respectively. Dose-limiting toxicity was not reported in patients during phase Ib and mean samotolisib exposures remained in the targeted range despite a 35% decrease when administered with enzalutamide. In phase II, median PCWG2-PFS and rPFS was significantly longer in the samotolisib/enzalutamide versus placebo/enzalutamide arm (3.8 vs. 2.8 months; P = 0.003 and 10.2 vs. 5.5 months; P = 0.03), respectively. Patients without androgen receptor splice variant 7 showed a significant and clinically meaningful rPFS benefit in the samotolisib/enzalutamide versus placebo/enzalutamide arm (13.2 months vs. 5.3 months; P = 0.03). Samotolisib/enzalutamide has tolerable side effects and significantly improved PFS in patients with mCRPC with cancer progression on abiraterone, and this may be enriched in patients with PTEN intact and no androgen receptor splice variant 7. Patients age 1-21 years with relapsed or refractory solid and CNS tumors were assigned to phase II studies of molecularly targeted therapies on the National Cancer Institute-Children's Oncology Group (NCI-COG) Pediatric Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (MATCH) trial. Patients whose tumors harbored predefined genetic alterations in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and lacked mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activating alterations were treated with the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor samotolisib. Patients received samotolisib twice daily in 28-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. A rolling 6 limited dose escalation was performed as, to our knowledge, this was the first pediatric study of samotolisib. The primary end point was the objective response rate; secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS) and the recommended phase II dose and toxicity of samotolisib in children. A total of 3.4% (41/1,206) of centrally tested patients were matched to this arm. Seventeen patients were treated. Among treated patients, the most common diagnoses included osteosarcoma (n = 6) and high-grade glioma (n = 5) harboring alterations in phosphatase and tensin homolog (n = 6),  This nationwide study was successful at identifying patients and evaluating the efficacy of molecularly targeted therapy for rare molecular subgroups of patients in a histology-agnostic fashion. Unfortunately, there was no activity of samotolisib against tumors with PI3K/mTOR pathway alterations. Prospective trials such as the NCI-COG Pediatric MATCH are necessary to evaluate the efficacy of molecularly targeted therapies given their increasing use in clinical practice. Acute liver injury (ALI) is associated with poor survival in patients with sepsis. During sepsis, the liver is the main site of bacterial endotoxin-induced inflammation. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) promotes caspase-4/5/11 activation, leading to pyroptosis, a major sepsis driver. This study aimed to identify novel drugs that can control hepatocyte caspase-4/5/11 activation during sepsis. We performed LPS-induced caspase-11 activation and pyroptosis in RAW 264.7 cells and established an LPS-induced ALI mouse model. We identified samotolisib (ST), a novel dual phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, by screening a library of 441 pyroptosis compounds with known targets, which dose-dependently inhibited caspase-11 activation and N-terminal fragment of gasdermin D (GSDMD-NT) generation, reducing RAW 264.7 cell pyroptosis. In mice, ST preconditioning improved survival, attenuated LPS-induced serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activity, and inhibited severe liver inflammation and damage. Importantly, ST treatment activated Nedd4, which directly interacts with and mediates caspase-11 ubiquitination and degradation. This was largely abrogated by insulin-like growth factor 1. ST ameliorated LPS-induced hepatotoxicity by inhibiting caspase-11/GSDMD-NT pyroptosis signaling via regulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR/Nedd4 signaling. Hence, ST may play a key role in the prevention of liver injury in patients with sepsis.",

         "Medical",
         "Bilastine is an antihistamine medication used to treat hives (urticaria), allergic rhinitis and itchy inflamed eyes (allergic conjunctivitis) caused by an allergy. It is a second-generation antihistamine and takes effect by selectively inhibiting the histamine H1 receptor, preventing these allergic reactions. Bilastine has an effectiveness similar to cetirizine, fexofenadine, and desloratadine. Bilastine was discovered by the Spanish firm FAES Farma and received its first approval in the European Union in 2010 for the symptomatic treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and urticaria. It is also approved in Canada and Australia. As of 2023, it remained unapproved for any use in the United States, although Hikma Pharmaceuticals had agreed in 2021 to begin the FDA approval process. Evidence has shown that bilastine is effective in treating skin and eye symptoms of allergic reactions, improving patient's quality of life. Bilastine meets the treatment criteria for allergic rhinitis, as published by the European Academy of Allergy and Clinical Immunology (EAACI) and the Allergic Rhinitis and its Impact on Asthma (ARIA) initiative. == Medical uses == === Allergic rhinoconjunctivitis === The clinical effectiveness of bilastine in treating allergic rhinitis (AR) and urticaria has been evaluated in 10 clinical trials, involving over 4,600 patients. In each study, bilastine was compared with a placebo and another second-generation antihistamine with established efficacy (active comparator). ==== Allergic rhinitis ==== The studies on SAR were double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group involving male and female patients over 12 year of age with symptomatic disease at the beginning of the study. Nasal symptoms (sneezing, rhinorrhea, nasal itching, and congestion) were assessed both before treatment and during treatment period on a daily basis. Non-nasal symptoms (itchy eye, watery eye, itchy ear, and palate) were also assessed according to a 0–3 scale, so that the Total Symptoms Score (TSS) and other related parameters could clearly reflect daily evolution of SAR in each patient and treatment group. Parameters such as quality of life and discomfort were also assessed, and in the same way the type and frequency of AE, tolerability and general safety of treatment were registered. In this SAR studies the daily oral administration during 14 days of bilastine proves to have the same efficacy as the administration of cetirizine and desloratadine. === Urticaria === A review article evaluated data from trials which detailed the efficacy of bilastine in skin models and urticaria to assess whether bilastine has an optimal profile for updosing in urticaria. The authors concluded that bilastine has an excellent profile for both efficacy and safety, although there is a need for controlled clinical trials to compare the efficacy of bilastine in a real-life updosing study in patients with urticaria, paying special attention to itch control. === Dosage and administration === Bilastine comes as a tablet taken by mouth (PO) and it is supposed to be swallowed whole with water. Bilastine should not be given with, or within 1 hour before or 2 hours after, food as it may reduce its effectiveness. Australian dosing guidelines for Allertine give a maximum dose of 20 mg (one tablet) daily as needed (PRN). Dose changes are not required for hepatic or renal impairment. While the onset of its effects vary between formulations, bilastine generally takes effect within 30–60 minutes. It should be taken only by children older than 4 years and adults, or anyone over 12 years for Allertine. == Side effects == Toxicity of bilastine investigated in preclinical toxicology studies in mice, rats and dogs after oral and intravenous administration showed no mortality observed after oral administration of massive doses. After intravenous administration, LD50 (lethal dose for 50% of animals) values were 33 and 45–75 mg/kg in mice and rats, respectively. No signs of toxicity were observed in any organ after bilastine massive overdosing, either orally (in mice, rats and dogs), or intravenously (in rats and dogs) during 4 weeks. No effects on fertility, no teratogenic or mutagenic effects, and no apparent carcinogenic potential were seen in the studies carried out in rats, mice and rabbits. In clinical research, bilastine has proven to be well tolerated, with an adverse events profile similar to that of placebo in healthy volunteers, patients with AR and with chronic idiopathic urticaria. Although the tolerance profile of bilastine and levocetirizine or desloratadine were very similar, bilastine was markedly better tolerated than cetirizine in a clinical assay in SAR, with fewer adverse events in the bilastine group. No anticholinergic adverse events were observed in the clinical trials with bilastine. No serious adverse events were reported during the research and there were no clinically significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiography (ECG) or laboratory tests. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles and studies in special populations indicate that dose adjustment of bilastine is not necessary in elderly patients or in chronic liver disease or chronic kidney disease. === Cardiac safety === The clinical cardiac safety of bilastine has been assessed in many clinical trials performed (more than 3,500 patients treated with bilastine) and in a phase I study (Thorough QT/QTc study) designed according to the ICH E14 guidance and the most demanding requirements from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).When electrocardiograms (ECG) data from all of the phase I studies are analysed, no significant alteration is appreciated in any of the parameters after administering bilastine at single doses (up to 11 times the therapeutic dose), nor at multiple doses (up to 10 times the therapeutic dose). Phase II and III studies on AR and urticaria (including the open-label extension phase of 12 months) do not reveal alterations in the ECG, nor significant prolongations of the QTc interval after administration of bilastine 20 mg. The Thorough QT/QTc study was designed to assess the effect on the QT/QTc interval, both of the therapeutic dose (20 mg) and 100 mg of bilastine, but also the coadministration of the therapeutic dose with usual doses of ketoconazol (400 mg/day), a metabolism inhibitor and a P-gP dependent transport system. It was verified that bilastine 20 and 100 mg administered during 4 days, does not induce significant changes in the QT/QTc interval duration in any of the individuals. Likewise, coadministration of bilastine 20 mg and ketoconazol 400 mg does not produce any significant prolongation of the QT/QTc interval attributable to bilastine. == Interactions == Preclinical data suggest the possibility of interactions between bilastine and drugs or food that are inhibitors or inducers of the P-glycoproteins. Coadministration of bilastine and grapefruit juice (a known P-glycoprotein-mediated drug transport activator) significantly reduced bilastine systemic exposure. This interaction is due to the known effect of grapefruit flavonoids on intestinal transporter systems such as P-glycoproteins and organic anion transporting peptide (OATP). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Bilastine binds to guinea-pig cerebellar histamine H1-receptors (Ki=44 nM) and to human recombinant histamine H1-receptors (Ki=64 nM) with an affinity comparable to that of astemizole and diphenhydramine, and superior than that of cetirizine by three-fold and fexofenadine by five-fold (Corcóstegui). In different murine models, bilastine by oral route, antagonizes the effects of histamine in a dose-dependent manner, with potency similar to that of cetirizine and between 5.5 and 10 times greater than that of fexofenadine. Preclinical investigations demonstrate the affinity and specificity of bilastine for histamine H1-receptors compared with other histamine receptors subtypes and other 30 receptors from different amines. In vivo experimentation confirmed the antihistaminic and antiallergic activity, which was at least comparable to that of other second-generation H1-antihistamines such as cetirizine. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Bilastine is most quickly absorbed with the absence of food, and reaches a mean peak plasma concentration of 220 ng/mL approximately 1 h after both single and multiple dosing. Absorption is reduced by a high-fat breakfast or fruit juice, and the estimated global oral bioavailability is approximately 60%. Bilastine has linear pharmacokinetics in the 2.5–220 mg dose range in healthy adult subjects without evidence of accumulation after 14 days of treatment. ==== Distribution ==== Bilastine distribution has an apparent volume of distribution of 1.29 L/kg, and has an elimination half-life of 14.5 h and plasma protein binding of 84–90%. Bilastine is a peripherally selective drug, and this is thought to be due to limited brain uptake caused by binding to P-glycoprotein. ==== Metabolism ==== Bilastine is not significantly metabolized in humans and is largely eliminated unchanged both in urine and feces – a third and two thirds of the administered dose, respectively, according to a Phase I mass-balance study with radiolabeled bilastine. Bilastine does not readily cross the blood brain barrier and is not metabolized by the liver. Ninety six percent of the administered dose is eliminated within 24 hours. In relation to its antihistamine effect, oral doses of 20 mg daily of bilastine, measured as skin wheal-and-flare surface areas for 24 h, bilastine is capable of inhibiting 50% of the surface areas – throughout the whole administration interval. == Chemistry == Bilastine, or 2-[4-[2-[4-[1-(2-ethoxyethyl) benzimidazol-2-yl] piperidin-1-yl] ethyl] phenyl]-2-methylpropionic acid, is a molecule with a molecular weight of 463.6 daltons and a chemical structure similar to piperidinyl-benzimidazole. Bilastine can be therefore classified into the same chemical group as many of the new antihistamines on the market, although it is not structurally derived, nor is it a metabolite or enantiomer of any of them, but an original molecule designed with the intent of fulfilling all the requirements of a second-generation antihistamine. === Research === Clinical studies using different dosages were done on histamine-induced wheal and flare reaction over a 24-h period, compared with a single 10 mg oral dose of cetirizine. The results of this research indicated that bilastine was at least as efficient as cetirizine in reducing histamine-mediated effects in healthy volunteers. Notably, 20 and 50 mg of bilastine reduced the wheal and flare reaction faster than cetirizine. == References ==",

         "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, abbreviated NADP or, in older notation, TPN (triphosphopyridine nucleotide), is a cofactor used in anabolic reactions, such as the Calvin cycle and lipid and nucleic acid syntheses, which require NADPH as a reducing agent ('hydrogen source'). NADPH is the reduced form, whereas NADP+ is the oxidized form. NADP+ is used by all forms of cellular life. NADP+ is essential for life because it is needed for cellular respiration. NADP+ differs from NAD+ by the presence of an additional phosphate group on the 2' position of the ribose ring that carries the adenine moiety. This extra phosphate is added by NAD+ kinase and removed by NADP+ phosphatase. == Biosynthesis == === NADP+ === In general, NADP+ is synthesized before NADPH is. Such a reaction usually starts with NAD+ from either the de-novo or the salvage pathway, with NAD+ kinase adding the extra phosphate group. ADP-ribosyl cyclase allows for synthesis from nicotinamide in the salvage pathway, and NADP+ phosphatase can convert NADPH back to NADH to maintain a balance. Some forms of the NAD+ kinase, notably the one in mitochondria, can also accept NADH to turn it directly into NADPH. The prokaryotic pathway is less well understood, but with all the similar proteins the process should work in a similar way. === NADPH === NADPH is produced from NADP+. The major source of NADPH in animals and other non-photosynthetic organisms is the pentose phosphate pathway, by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in the first step. The pentose phosphate pathway also produces pentose, another important part of NAD(P)H, from glucose. Some bacteria also use G6PDH for the Entner–Doudoroff pathway, but NADPH production remains the same. Ferredoxin–NADP+ reductase, present in all domains of life, is a major source of NADPH in photosynthetic organisms including plants and cyanobacteria. It appears in the last step of the electron chain of the light reactions of photosynthesis. It is used as reducing power for the biosynthetic reactions in the Calvin cycle to assimilate carbon dioxide and help turn the carbon dioxide into glucose. It has functions in accepting electrons in other non-photosynthetic pathways as well: it is needed in the reduction of nitrate into ammonia for plant assimilation in nitrogen cycle and in the production of oils. There are several other lesser-known mechanisms of generating NADPH, all of which depend on the presence of mitochondria in eukaryotes. The key enzymes in these carbon-metabolism-related processes are NADP-linked isoforms of malic enzyme, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), and glutamate dehydrogenase. In these reactions, NADP+ acts like NAD+ in other enzymes as an oxidizing agent. The isocitrate dehydrogenase mechanism appears to be the major source of NADPH in fat and possibly also liver cells. These processes are also found in bacteria. Bacteria can also use a NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase for the same purpose. Like the pentose phosphate pathway, these pathways are related to parts of glycolysis. Another carbon metabolism-related pathway involved in the generation of NADPH is the mitochondrial folate cycle, which uses principally serine as a source of one-carbon units to sustain nucleotide synthesis and redox homeostasis in mitochondria. Mitochondrial folate cycle has been recently suggested as the principal contributor to NADPH generation in mitochondria of cancer cells. NADPH can also be generated through pathways unrelated to carbon metabolism. The ferredoxin reductase is such an example. Nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase transfers the hydrogen between NAD(P)H and NAD(P)+, and is found in eukaryotic mitochondria and many bacteria. There are versions that depend on a proton gradient to work and ones that do not. Some anaerobic organisms use NADP+-linked hydrogenase, ripping a hydride from hydrogen gas to produce a proton and NADPH. Like NADH, NADPH is fluorescent. NADPH in aqueous solution excited at the nicotinamide absorbance of ~335 nm (near UV) has a fluorescence emission which peaks at 445-460 nm (violet to blue). NADP+ has no appreciable fluorescence. == Function == NADPH provides the reducing agents, usually hydrogen atoms, for biosynthetic reactions and the oxidation-reduction involved in protecting against the toxicity of reactive oxygen species (ROS), allowing the regeneration of glutathione (GSH). NADPH is also used for anabolic pathways, such as cholesterol synthesis, steroid synthesis, ascorbic acid synthesis, xylitol synthesis, cytosolic fatty acid synthesis and microsomal fatty acid chain elongation. The NADPH system is also responsible for generating free radicals in immune cells by NADPH oxidase. These radicals are used to destroy pathogens in a process termed the respiratory burst. It is the source of reducing equivalents for cytochrome P450 hydroxylation of aromatic compounds, steroids, alcohols, and drugs. == Stability == NADH and NADPH are very stable in basic solutions, but NAD+ and NADP+ are degraded in basic solutions into a fluorescent product that can be used conveniently for quantitation. Conversely, NADPH and NADH are degraded by acidic solutions while NAD+/NADP+ are fairly stable to acid. == Enzymes that use NADP(H) as a coenzyme == Many enzymes that bind NADP share a common super-secondary structure named named the \"Rossmann fold\". The initial beta-alpha-beta (βαβ) fold is the most conserved segment of the Rossmann folds. This segment is in contact with the ADP portion of NADP. Therefore, it is also called an \"ADP-binding βαβ fold\". Adrenodoxin reductase: This enzyme is present ubiquitously in most organisms. It transfers two electrons from NADPH to FAD. In vertebrates, it serves as the first enzyme in the chain of mitochondrial P450 systems that synthesize steroid hormones. == Enzymes that use NADP(H) as a substrate == In 2018 and 2019, the first two reports of enzymes that catalyze the removal of the 2' phosphate of NADP(H) in eukaryotes emerged. First the cytoplasmic protein MESH1 (Q8N4P3), then the mitochondrial protein nocturnin were reported. Of note, the structures and NADPH binding of MESH1 (5VXA) and nocturnin (6NF0) are not related. == References ==",

         "Guanethidine is an antihypertensive drug that reduces the release of catecholamines, such as norepinephrine. Guanethidine is transported across the sympathetic nerve membrane by the same mechanism that transports norepinephrine itself (NET, uptake 1), and uptake is essential for the drug's action. Once guanethidine has entered the nerve, it is concentrated in transmitter vesicles, where it replaces norepinephrine. It may also inhibit the release of granules by decreasing norepinephrine. == Medical uses == Guanethidine was once a mainstay for hypertension resistant to other agents, and was often used safely during pregnancy, but it is no longer used in the US due to lack of availability. It is still licensed in some countries, e.g., UK, for the rapid control of blood pressure in a hypertensive emergency. Intravenous nerve block (Bier block) using guanethidine has been used to treat chronic pain caused by complex regional pain syndrome. == Side effects == Side effects include postural and exercise hypotension, sexual dysfunction (delayed or retrograde ejaculation), and diarrhea. == Pharmacology == Guanethidine is transported by uptake 1 into the presynaptic terminal transported by norepinephrine transporter (NET). (In this it competes with norepinephrine so can potentiate exogenously applied norepinephrine.) It becomes concentrated in norepinephrine transmitter vesicles, replacing norepinephrine in these vesicles. This leads to a gradual depletion of norepinephrine stores in the nerve endings. Once inside the terminal it blocks the release of norepinephrine in response to arrival of an action potential. Spontaneous release is not affected. == References ==",

         "Medical",
         "Ivabradine, sold under the brand name Procoralan among others, is a medication, which is a pacemaker current (If) inhibitor, used for the symptomatic management of heart-related chest pain and heart failure. Patients who qualify for use of ivabradine for congestive heart failure are patients who have symptomatic heart failure, with reduced ejection fraction, and heart rate at least 70 bpm, and the condition not able to be fully managed by beta blockers. Ivabradine acts by allowing negative chronotropy in the sinoatrial structure, thus reducing the heart rate via specific inhibition of the pacemaker current. It operates by a mechanism different from that of beta blockers and calcium channel blockers, which are two commonly prescribed antianginal classes of cardiac drugs. Ivabradine has no apparent inotropic properties and may be a cardiotonic agent. == Medical uses == It is used for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris in patients with normal sinus rhythm who cannot take beta blockers. It is also being used off-label in the treatment of inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST). Ivabradine stands as a pharmacological option for controlling HR and rhythm without associated side effects in postoperative CABG patients with IST. === Chest pain === Ivabradine is as effective as the beta blocker atenolol and comparable with amlodipine in the management of chronic stable angina, as demonstrated by improvements in total exercise duration in non-inferiority trials, hence it can be an alternative therapy for those who cannot tolerate conventional therapies. In people not sufficiently managed with beta blockers for their angina, adding ivabradine can further reduce heart rate and improve total exercise duration. === Heart failure === It is used in combination with beta blockers in people with heart failure with LVEF lower than 35 percent inadequately controlled by beta blockers alone and whose heart rate exceeds 70 beats per minute. In people not sufficiently managed with beta blockers for their heart failure adding ivabradine decreases the risk of hospitalization for heart failure. === Tachycardia === The clinical use of ivabradine is predicated on its mechanism of action on sinoatrial nodal tissue where it selectively inhibits the funny current (If) and results in a decrease in heart rate. Ivabradine’s most frequent application in electrophysiology is for the treatment of inappropriate sinus tachycardia. Its use for inappropriate sinus tachycardia is not a European Medicines Agency or Food and Drug Administration approved indication for ivabradine. It has been used experimentally for the treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome in patients with long COVID. It was used for POTS prior to this too. Many cardiologists have found success with this in their POTS patients. == Contraindications == Ivabradine is contraindicated in sick sinus syndrome. It should also not be used concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, including azole antifungals (such as ketoconazole), macrolide antibiotics, nefazodone and the antiretroviral drugs nelfinavir and ritonavir. Use of ivabradine with verapamil or diltiazem is contraindicated. == Adverse effects == Overall, 14.5% of patients taking ivabradine experience luminous phenomena (by patients described as sensations of enhanced brightness in a fully maintained visual field). This is probably due to blockage of Ih ion channels in the retina, which are very similar to cardiac If. These symptoms are mild, transient, and fully reversible. In clinical studies, about 1% of all patients had to discontinue the drug because of these sensations, which occurred on average 40 days after the drug was started. In a large clinical trial, bradycardia (unusually slow heart rate) occurred in 2% and 5% of patients taking ivabradine at doses of 7.5 and 10 mg respectively (compared to 4.3% in those taking atenolol). Headaches were reported in 2.6 to 4.8 percent of cases. Other common adverse drug reactions (1–10% of patients) include first-degree AV block, ventricular extrasystoles, dizziness and/or blurred vision. == Mechanism of action == Ivabradine acts on the If (f is for \"funny\", so called because it had unusual properties compared with other current systems known at the time of its discovery) ion current, which is highly expressed in the sinoatrial node. If is a mixed Na+–K+ inward current activated by hyperpolarization and modulated by the autonomic nervous system. It is one of the most important ionic currents for regulating pacemaker activity in the sinoatrial (SA) node. Ivabradine selectively inhibits the pacemaker If current in a dose-dependent manner. Blocking this channel reduces cardiac pacemaker activity, selectively slowing the heart rate and allowing more time for blood to flow to the myocardium. By inhibiting the If channel, ivabradine reduces the heart rate and workload on the heart. This is relevant in the usage of the medication to treat angina as well as congestive heart failure. This is in contrast to other commonly used rate-reducing medications, such as beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers, which not only reduce heart rate, but also the cardiac contractility. Given the selective decrease in rate without loss of contractility, ivabradine may prove efficacious for treatment of congestive heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Ivabradine binds to HCN4 receptors (potassium/sodium hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 4), utilizing Y506, F509 and I510 residues. == Clinical trials == === Coronary artery disease === The BEAUTIFUL study randomised over 10917 patients having stable coronary artery disease and left ventricle dysfunction (ejection fraction < 40%). Ivabradine did not show a significant reduction in the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, admission to hospital for acute myocardial infarction, and admission to hospital for new onset or worsening heart failure. However, in a prespecified subgroup of patients with a baseline heart rate of more than 70 bpm, ivabradine significantly reduced the following secondary endpoints: Coronary events by 22% (P=0.023) Fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction by 36% (P=0.001) Coronary revascularization by 30% (P=0.016). These results were seen in combination therapy with beta blockers, and were found to be safe and effective in improving coronary artery disease outcomes in patients with heart rates of 70 bpm or more. The SIGNIFY trial randomised 19102 patients with stable coronary artery disease and an elevated heart rate greater than 70 beats per minute were assigned to an intervention of ivabradine or placebo in addition to standard therapy. Ivabradine did not significantly improve the secondary outcomes in patient groups, however did demonstrate a reduction in heart rate. When compared to the SHIFT study, a reduction in cardiovascular death or hospital admission was also demonstrated and hence should be considered when additional therapy is in question. === Chronic heart failure === In the SHIFT study, ivabradine significantly reduced the risk of the primary composite endpoint of hospitalization for worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death by 18% (P<0.0001) compared with placebo on top of optimal therapy. These benefits were observed after 3 months of treatment. SHIFT also showed that administration of ivabradine to heart failure patients significantly reduced the risk of death from heart failure by 26% (P=0.014) and hospitalization for heart failure by 26% (P<0.0001). The improvements in outcomes were observed throughout all prespecified subgroups: female and male, with or without beta-blockers at randomization, patients below and over 65 years of age, with heart failure of ischemic or non-ischemic etiology, NYHA class II or class III, IV, with or without diabetes, and with or without hypertension. A 2020 Cochrane review found no difference in cardiovascular mortality and serious adverse events between long-term treatment with ivabradine and placebo/usual care/no treatment in participants with heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction. A note of caution must be emphasised. Ivabradine, though indicated for chronic heart failure in patients who are clinically stable, is not indicated in acute heart failure where the enhanced heart rate represents cardiac reserve. Indiscriminate use of Ivabradine could destabilise these patients. == Society and culture == === Approval === Ivabradine was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2005, and by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2015. === Alleged conflict of interest === According to a documentary and article of the Danish media channel TV2 in September 2024, a former president of the European Society of Cardiology during 2006-2008, professor Kim Fox, had a conflict of interest in relation to clinical trials of ivabradine and his recommendation of ivabradine based on the trials. According to TV2, Fox and his partner founded a company, Heart Research Ltd., which performed clinical trials and received payments from the pharmaceutical industry, allowing them to extract a total profit of 500 million DKK (67 million euro) during 2003-2015, mostly from a cooperation with the French pharmaceutical company Servier. According to TV2's research of financial statements of the company, in the period of 2004-2006, the couple received a salary of over 20 million DKK (2.7 million euro) from their company, while during the same period, Kim Fox was chairman of the taskforce recommending ivabradine, and as president of the European Society of Cardiology, he also had the role of presenting the research results and recommending ivabradin as a \"gold standard\" treatment at a European cardiological conference in 2008. Karsten Juhl Jørgensen, professor of medicine and conflict of interests expert at Odense University and the Nordic Cochrane Centre, commented that the conflict of interest was \"probably the largest he had seen\". Danish chief physician Niels Holmark Andersen commented that Fox's conflict of interest was of an \"oligarchal magnitude\" and \"the mother of all conflicts of interests\" because Fox was involved in all parts of the process, that the clinical results did not sustain claims of the superiority of the medication which has serious adverse effect, and further that Servier had marketed ivabradine \"aggressively\" and offered physicians exclusive trips to castles in France to promote the medication during the decade of 2000-2010. === Names === It is marketed by Amgen under the brand name Corlanor in the United States, and by Servier in the rest of the world under the brand names Procoralan (worldwide), Coralan (in Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and some other countries), Corlentor (in Armenia, Spain, Italy and Romania), Lancora (in Canada) and Coraxan (in Russia and Serbia). It is also marketed in India under the brand names Ivabrad, Ivabid. In Iran it's sold under the brand name \"bradix\" . IVAMAC and Bradia. During its development, ivabradine was known as S-16257. == References == == External links ==",

         "Spiramycin is a macrolide antibiotic and antiparasitic. It is used to treat toxoplasmosis and various other infections of soft tissues. Although used in Europe, Canada and Mexico, spiramycin is still considered an experimental drug in the United States, but can sometimes be obtained by special permission from the FDA for toxoplasmosis in the first trimester of pregnancy. Spiramycin has been used in Europe since the year 2000 under the trade name \"Rovamycine\", produced by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Sanofi and Famar Lyon, France and Eczacıbaşı İlaç, Turkey. It also goes under the name Rovamycine in Canada (distributed by OdanLaboratories), where it is mostly marketed to dentists for mouth infections. Spiramycin has been studied as a virulence inhibitor in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. == Medical uses == === Available forms === It is available for parenteral and oral administration. Another treatment option (typically used after 16w gestation) are a combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine (given with leucovorin). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === The antibiotic action involves inhibition of protein synthesis in the bacterial cell during translocation. Resistance to spiramycin can develop by several mechanisms and its prevalence is to a considerable extent proportional to the frequency of prescription in a given area. The antibacterial spectrum comprises Gram-positive cocci and rods, Gram-negative cocci and also Legionellae, mycoplasmas, chlamydiae, some types of spirochetes, Toxoplasma gondii and Cryptosporidium species. Enterobacteria, pseudomonads and pathogenic moulds are resistant. Its action is mainly bacteriostatic, on highly sensitive strains it exerts a bactericide action. As compared with erythromycin, it is in vitro weight for weight 5 to 20 less effective, an equipotential therapeutic dose is, however, only double. This difference between the effectiveness in vitro and in vivo is explained above all by the great affinity of spiramycin to tissues where it achieves concentrations many times higher than serum levels. An important part is played also by the slow release of the antibiotic from the tissue compartment, the marked action on microbes in sub-inhibition concentrations and the relatively long persisting post-antibiotic effect. Its great advantage is the exceptionally favourable tolerance-gastrointestinal and general. == Chemistry == Spiramycin is a 16-membered ring macrolide. == History == It was isolated in 1954 as a product of Streptomyces ambofaciens by PINNERT-SINDICO. As a preparation for oral administration it has been used since 1955, in 1987 also the parenteral form was introduced into practice. == References ==",

         "Succimer, sold under the brand name Chemet among others, is a medication tool used to treat lead, mercury, and arsenic poisoning. When it's radiolabeled with technetium-99m, it's used in many types of diagnostic testing. A full course of Succimer lasts for 19 days of oral administration. A second course should be given when more than two weeks pass after the first course. Common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and low blood neutrophil levels. Liver problems and allergic reactions may also occur with use. Whether use during pregnancy is safe for the baby is unclear. Dimercaptosuccinic acid is in the chelating agent family of medications. It works by binding with lead and a number of other heavy metals, allowing them to leave the body in the urine. Succimer has been used medically since the 1950s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In the United States, no generic version was available as of 2015. == Medical uses == Succimer is indicated for the treatment of lead poisoning in children with blood level measured above 45 μg/dL. The use of dimercaptosuccinic acid is not approved for prevention of lead poisoning in anticipation of exposure in known lead-contaminated environments. Dimercaptosuccinic acid can cross the blood–brain barrier of mice, but it is not known if this is also the case in humans. Even if dimercaptosuccinic acid cannot reverse the damages done to the central nervous system, it might prevent further deterioration. Succimer facilitates urinary excretion of lead, and with sufficiently aggressive treatment, can reduce lead content in the brain. It also increases urinary excretion of copper and zinc. Dimercaptosuccinic acid improved cognitive function in rats that had been exposed to lead, but reduced cognitive function in rats that had not been exposed to lead. == Chemistry == Succimer is an isomer of 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid. 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid is the organosulfur compound with the formula HO2CCH(SH)CH(SH)CO2H. This colorless solid contains two carboxylic acid and two thiol groups, the latter being responsible for its mildly unpleasant odour. It occurs in two diastereomers, meso and the chiral dl forms. The 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid molecule has two stereocentres (two asymmetric carbon atoms), and can exist as three different stereoisomers. The 2S,3S and 2R,3R isomers are a pair of enantiomers, whereas the 2R,3S isomer (succimer) is a meso compound and thus optically inactive. == Preparation and reactivity == Dimercaptosuccinic acid may be prepared by reacting acetylenedicarboxylic acid with sodium thiosulfate or thioacetic acid followed by hydrolysis. The dimethyl ester is also known. Meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid binds to \"soft\" heavy metals such as Hg2+ and Pb2+, mobilizing these ions for excretion. It binds to metal cations through the thiol groups, which ionize upon complexation. == History == Dimercaptosuccinic acid was first synthesized by V. L. Nirenburg in the Urals Polytechnic Institute, commissioned by one of the electrical enterprises of Sverdlovsk, Russia, which consumed many tons of mercury and was looking for a medicine to prevent poisoning of personnel. In 1957, Chinese scientists found that dimercaptosuccinic acid can effectively treat antimony poisoning due to overdose of tartar emetic. Pronounced protective effect in animal poisoning with arsenic and mercury was first shown by I. E. Okonishnikova in 1962. In 1984, the now-defunct Bock Pharmaceutical Company requested the FDA grant approval for orphan drug status under the brand name Chemet and the FDA approved of this in 1991. It provided exclusivity until 1998 which was conveyed to the successor Sanofi in 1996. == References == == Further reading ==",

         "Medical",
         "Valsartan, sold under the brand name Diovan among others, is a medication used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and diabetic kidney disease. It belongs to a class of medications referred to as angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). It is a reasonable initial treatment for high blood pressure. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include feeling tired, dizziness, high blood potassium, diarrhea, and joint pain. Other serious side effects may include kidney problems, low blood pressure, and angioedema. Use in pregnancy may harm the baby and use when breastfeeding is not recommended. It is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist and works by blocking the effects of angiotensin II. Valsartan was patented in 1990, and came into medical use in 1996. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 117th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Valsartan is used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and to reduce death for people with left ventricular dysfunction after having a heart attack. === High blood pressure === Valsartan (and other ARBs) are an appropriate initial treatment option for most people with high blood pressure and no other coexisting conditions, as are ACE inhibitors, thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers. If patients have coexisting diabetes or kidney disease, ARBs or ACE inhibitors may be considered over other classes of blood pressure medicines. === Heart failure === Valsartan has reduced rates of mortality and heart failure hospitalisations when used alone or in combination with beta blockers in the treatment of heart failure. Importantly, the combination of valsartan and ACE inhibitors has not shown morbidity or mortality benefits but rather increases mortality risk when added to combination beta blocker and ACE inhibitor therapy, and increases the risk of adverse events like hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal failure. As shown in the PARADIGM-HF study, valsartan combined with sacubitril for the treatment of heart failure, significantly reduced all cause and cardiovascular mortality and hospitalisations due to heart failure. === Diabetic kidney disease === In people with type 2 diabetes, antihypertensive therapy with valsartan decreases the rate of progression of albuminuria (albumin in urine), promotes regression to normoalbuminuria and may reduce the rate of progression to end-stage kidney disease. == Contraindications == The packaging for valsartan includes a warning stating the drug should not be used with the renin inhibitor aliskiren in people with diabetes. It also states the safety of the drug in severe renal impairment has not been established. Valsartan includes a black box warning for fetal toxicity. Discontinuation of these agents is recommended immediately after detection of pregnancy and an alternative medication should be started. Breastfeeding is not recommended. == Side effects == Side effects depend on the reason the medication is being used. === Heart failure === Adverse effects are based on a comparison versus placebo in people with heart failure. Most common side effects include dizziness (17% vs 9% ), low blood pressure (7% vs 2%), and diarrhea (5% vs 4%). Less common side effects include joint pain, fatigue, and back pain (all 3% vs 2%). === Hypertension === Clinical trials for valsartan treatment for hypertension versus placebo demonstrate side effects like viral infection (3% vs 2%), fatigue (2% vs 1%) and abdominal pain (2% vs 1%). Minor side effects that occurred at >1% but were similar to rates from the placebo group include: headache dizziness upper respiratory infection cough diarrhea rhinitis/sinusitis nausea pharyngitis edema arthralgia === Kidney failure === People treated with ARBs including valsartan or diuretics are susceptible to conditions of developing low renal blood flow such as abnormal narrowing of blood vessels in the kidney, hypertension, renal artery stenosis, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion whose renal function is in part dependent on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system like efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction done by angiotensin II are at high risk of deterioration of renal function comprising acute kidney failure, oliguria, worsening azotemia or heightened serum creatinine. When blood flow to the kidneys is reduced, the kidney activates a series of responses that triggers angiotensin release to constrict blood vessels and facilitate blood flow in the kidney. So long as the nephron function degradation is progressive or reaches clinically significant levels, withholding or discontinuing valsartan is warranted. == Interactions == The US prescribing information lists the following drug interactions for valsartan: Other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system may increase the risks of low blood pressure, kidney problems, and hyperkalemia. Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium may increase the risk of hyperkalemia. NSAIDs may increase the risk of kidney problems and may interfere with blood pressure-lowering effects. Valsartan may increase the concentration of lithium. Valsartan and other angiotensin-related blood pressure medications may interact with the antibiotics co-trimoxazole or ciprofloxacin to increase risk of sudden death due to cardiac arrest. === Food interaction === With the tablet, food decreases the valsartan tablet taker's exposure to valsartan by about 40% and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50%, evidenced by AUC change. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Valsartan blocks the actions of angiotensin II, which include constricting blood vessels and activating aldosterone, to reduce blood pressure. The drug binds to angiotensin type I receptors (AT1), working as an antagonist. This mechanism of action is different than that of the ACE inhibitor drugs, which block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. As valsartan acts at the receptor, it can provide more complete angiotensin II antagonism since angiotensin II is generated by other enzymes as well as ACE. Also, valsartan does not affect the metabolism of bradykinin like ACE inhibitors do. === Pharmacodynamics === === Pharmacokinetics === The peak concentration of valsartan in plasma occurs 2 to 4 hours after dosing. AUC and Cmax values of valsartan are observed to be approximately linearly dose-dependent over therapeutic dosing range. Owing to its relatively short elimination half life attribution, valsartan concentration in plasma does not accumulate in response to repeated dosing. == Society and culture == === Economics === In 2010, valsartan (trade name Diovan) achieved annual sales of $2.052 billion in the United States and $6.053 billion worldwide. The patents for valsartan and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide expired in September 2012. === Combinations === Versions are available as the combinations valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/amlodipine, valsartan/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/nebivolol, and valsartan/sacubitril. Valsartan is combined with amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) (or both) into single-pill formulations for treating hypertension with multiple drugs. Valsartan is also available as the combination valsartan/sacubitril. It is used to treat heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. === Recalls === In July 2018, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recalled certain batches of valsartan and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide film-coated tablets distributed in 22 countries in the European Union. Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical Co. (ZHP) in Linhai, China manufactured the bulk ingredient contaminated by N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a carcinogen. The active pharmaceutical ingredient was subsequently imported by a number of generic drugmakers, including Novartis, and marketed in Europe and Asia under their subsidiary Sandoz labeling, and in the UK by Dexcel Pharma Ltd and Accord Healthcare. Valsartan was recalled in Canada. Authorities believe the degree of contamination is negligible. In July 2018, The National Agency of Drug and Food Control (NA-DFC or Badan POM Indonesia) announced voluntary recalls for two products containing valsartan produced by Actavis Indonesia and Dipa Pharmalab Intersains. In July 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced voluntary recalls of certain supplies of valsartan and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide in the US distributed by Solco Healthcare LLC, Major Pharmaceuticals, and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. Hong Kong's Department of Health initiated a similar recall. In August 2018, the FDA published two lengthy, updated lists, classifying hundreds of specific US products containing valsartan into those included versus excluded from the recall. A week later, the FDA cited two more drugmakers, Zhejiang Tianyu Pharmaceuticals of China and Hetero Labs Limited of India, as additional sources of the contaminated valsartan ingredient. In September 2018, the FDA announced that retesting of all valsartan supplies had found a second carcinogenic impurity, N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), in the recalled products made by ZHP in China and marketed in the US under the Torrent Pharmaceuticals (India) brand. According to a 2018 Reuters analysis of national medicines agencies' records, more than 50 companies around the world have recalled valsartan mono-preparations or combination products manufactured from the tainted valsartan ingredient. The contamination has likely been present since 2012 when the manufacturing process was changed and approved by EDQM and FDA authorities. Based on inspections in late 2018, both agencies have suspended the Chinese and Indian manufacturers' certificates of suitability for the supply of valsartan in the EU and the US. In 2019, many more preparations of valsartan and its combinations were recalled due to the presence of the contaminant NDMA. In August 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) provided guidance to marketing authorization holders on how to avoid the presence of nitrosamine impurities in human medicines and asked them to review all chemical and biological human medicines for the possible presence of nitrosamines and to test the products at risk. The FDA issued revised guidelines about nitrosamine impurities in September 2024. === Shortages === Since July 2018, numerous recalls of losartan, valsartan and irbesartan drug products have caused marked shortages of these life saving medications in North America and Europe, particularly for valsartan. In March 2019, the FDA approved an additional generic version of valsartan to address the issue. According to the agency, the shortage of valsartan was resolved in April 2020, but the availability of the generic form remained unstable into July 2020. Pharmacies in the European Union were notified that the supply of the drug, particularly for higher dosage forms, would remain unstable well into December 2020. == Research == In people with impaired glucose tolerance, valsartan may decrease the incidence of developing diabetes mellitus type 2. However, the absolute risk reduction is small (less than 1 percent per year) and diet, exercise or other drugs, may be more protective. In the same study, no reduction in the rate of cardiovascular events (including death) was shown. In one study of people without diabetes, valsartan reduced the risk of developing diabetes mellitus over amlodipine, mainly for those with hypertension. A prospective study demonstrated a reduction in the incidence and progression of Alzheimer's disease and dementia. == References ==",

         " This study was designed to analyse the effects of the novel, orally bioavailable CDK9-inhibitor Atuveciclib (BAY 1143572) in combination with tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cancer cells. To assess the effect of combinatorial use of atuveciclib and TRAIL on pancreatic cancer cells, we used an MTT assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, and western blot analysis. Atuveciclib combined with TRAIL significantly reduced the viability of pancreatic cancer cells and their colony formation potential by inducing apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest. Atuveciclib sensitised PDAC cells to TRAIL-induced cell death through the concomitant suppression of cFlip and Mcl-1. A gemcitabine-resistant PDAC cell-line and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cell lines were also suppressed by this combinatorial approach. This study provides the basis for further preclinical and clinical evaluation of combined treatment with atuveciclib and TRAIL. Psoriasis is a chronic, autoimmune skin disease characterized by the deregulated secretion of inflammatory factors in multiple organs. The aberrant activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway mediated by cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) is vital for the pathology of psoriasis, leading to the accumulation of inflammatory factors and the progression of skin damage. In this study, we explored the effect of CDK9 inhibition on attenuating the secretion of inflammatory factors and alleviating skin damage in psoriasis models both in vitro and in vivo. Results showed that Atuveciclib, a highly selective CDK9 inhibitor, significantly relieved skin lesions in Imiquimod (IMQ)-induced mice models by lowering the expression of CDK9 and p-RNA Pol II  Selective inhibition of exclusively transcription-regulating PTEFb/CDK9 is a promising new approach in cancer therapy. Starting from lead compound BAY-958, lead optimization efforts strictly focusing on kinase selectivity, physicochemical and DMPK properties finally led to the identification of the orally available clinical candidate atuveciclib (BAY 1143572). Structurally characterized by an unusual benzyl sulfoximine group, BAY 1143572 exhibited the best overall profile in vitro and in vivo, including high efficacy and good tolerability in xenograft models in mice and rats. BAY 1143572 is the first potent and highly selective PTEFb/CDK9 inhibitor to enter clinical trials for the treatment of cancer.",

         "Binimetinib, sold under the brand name Mektovi, is an anti-cancer medication used to treat various cancers. Binimetinib is a selective inhibitor of MEK, a central kinase in the tumor-promoting MAPK pathway. Inappropriate activation of the pathway has been shown to occur in many cancers. In June 2018 it was approved by the FDA in combination with encorafenib for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive melanoma. In October 2023, it was approved by the FDA for treatment of NSCLC with a BRAF V600E mutation in combination with encorafenib. It was developed by Array Biopharma. == Mechanism of action == Binimetinib is an orally available inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), or more specifically, a MAP2K inhibitor. MEK is part of the RAS pathway, which is involved in cell proliferation and survival. MEK is upregulated in many forms of cancer. Binimetinib, uncompetitive with ATP, binds to and inhibits the activity of MEK1/2 kinase, which has been shown to regulate several key cellular activities including proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. MEK1/2 are dual-specificity threonine/tyrosine kinases that play key roles in the activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway and are often upregulated in a variety of tumor cell types. Inhibition of MEK1/2 prevents the activation of MEK1/2 dependent effector proteins and transcription factors, which may result in the inhibition of growth factor-mediated cell signaling. As demonstrated in preclinical studies, this may eventually lead to an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and an inhibition in production of various inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1, -6 and tumor necrosis factor. == Development == In 2015, it was in phase III clinical trials for ovarian cancer, BRAF mutant melanoma, and NRAS Q61 mutant melanoma. In December 2015, the company announced that the mutant-NRAS melanoma trial was successful. In the trial, those receiving binimetinib had a median progression-free survival of 2.8 months versus 1.5 months for those on the standard dacarbazine treatment. NDA submitted Jun 2016, and the FDA should decide by 30 June 2017. In April 2016, it was reported that the phase III trial for low-grade ovarian cancer was terminated due to lack of efficacy. In 2017, the FDA informed Array Biopharma that the phase III trial data was not sufficient and the New Drug Application was withdrawn. In June 2018, it was approved for the treatment of certain melanomas by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in combination with encorafenib. The FDA approved binimetinib based primarily on evidence from one clinical trial (NCT01909453) of 383 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma that was advanced or could not be removed by surgery. The trial was conducted at 162 sites in Europe, North America, and various countries around the world. In October 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration approved encorafenib with binimetinib for adults with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a BRAF V600E mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test. == References == == External links ==",

         "Medical",
         "Donepezil, sold under the brand name Aricept among others, is a medication used to treat dementia of the Alzheimer's type. It appears to result in a small benefit in mental function and ability to function. Use, however, has not been shown to change the progression of the disease. Treatment should be stopped if no benefit is seen. It is taken by mouth or via a transdermal patch. Donepezil is a centrally acting reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and structurally unrelated to other anticholinesterase agents. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping, aggression, diarrhea, feeling tired, and muscle cramps. Serious side effects may include abnormal heart rhythms, urinary incontinence, and seizures. Donepezil was approved for medical use in the United States in 1996. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 146th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Alzheimer's disease === There is no evidence that donepezil or other similar agents alter the course or progression of Alzheimer's disease. Six-to-twelve-month controlled studies have shown modest benefits in cognition or behavior. The UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends donepezil as an option in the management of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. The person should, however, be reviewed frequently and if there is no significant benefit it should be stopped. In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also approved donepezil for treatment of mild, moderate and severe dementia in Alzheimer's disease. === Other === Lewy body dementia: Some studies have shown benefits of donepezil for the treatment of cognitive and behavioral symptoms in Lewy body dementia. Traumatic brain injury: Some research suggests an improvement in memory dysfunction in patients with traumatic brain injury with donepezil use. Vascular dementia: Studies have shown that donepezil may improve cognition in patients with vascular dementia but not overall global functioning. Dementia associated with Parkinson disease: Some evidence suggests that donepezil can improve cognition, executive function, and global status in Parkinson disease dementia. == Adverse effects == In clinical trials the most common adverse events leading to discontinuation were nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. Other side effects included difficulty sleeping, muscle cramps and loss of appetite. Most side effects were observed in patients taking the 23 mg dose compared to 10 mg or lower doses. Side effects are mild and transient in most patients, lasting up to three weeks and usually improved even with continued use. Donepezil, like other cholinesterase inhibitors, can cause nightmares due to enhanced activation of the visual association cortex during REM sleep. Dosing donepezil in the morning can reduce the frequency of nightmares. === Precautions === Donepezil should be used with caution in people with heart disease, cardiac conduction disturbances, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, severe cardiac arrhythmia and sick sinus syndrome. People with peptic ulcer disease or taking NSAIDs should use with caution because increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was noted. Slow heart beat and fainting in people with heart problems were also seen. These symptoms may appear more frequent when initiating treatment or increasing the donepezil dose. Although occurrence of seizures is rare, people who have a predisposition to seizures should be treated with caution. If daily donepezil has suspended for 7 days or less, restarting at the same dose is recommended, while if the suspension lasts longer than 7 days, retitrate from 5 mg daily is suggested. == Mechanism of action == Donepezil binds and reversibly inhibits enzymes called cholinesterases, especially acetylcholinesterase, thus inhibiting hydrolysis of acetylcholine. This increases acetylcholine concentrations at cholinergic synapses. The precise mechanism of action of donepezil in patients with Alzheimer's disease is not fully understood. Certainly, Alzheimer's disease involves a substantial loss of the elements of the cholinergic system and it is generally accepted that the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease are related to this cholinergic deficit, particularly in the cerebral cortex and other areas of the brain. In addition to its actions as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, donepezil has been found to act as a potent agonist of the σ1 receptor (Ki = 14.6 nM), and has been shown to produce specific antiamnestic effects in animals mainly via this action. Some noncholinergic mechanisms have also been proposed. Donepezil upregulates the nicotinic receptors in the cortical neurons, adding to neuroprotective activity. It inhibits voltage-activated sodium currents reversibly and delays rectifier potassium currents and fast transient potassium currents, although this action is unlikely to contribute to clinical effects. == Synergy == Donepezil was claimed to act synergistically with an agent called FK962 [283167-06-6] & FK960 [133920-70-4]. {potential activation of somatostatinergic neurotransmission} However, the development was discontinued after Phase II \"since the data reviewed did not indicate clear efficacy of the compound for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.\" == Stereochemistry == Donepezil medications are racemates. == History == Research leading to the development of donepezil began in 1983, at Eisai, and in 1996, Eisai received approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for donepezil under the brand Aricept, which it co-marketed with Pfizer. The team at Eisai was led by Hachiro Sugimoto. As of 2011, Aricept was the world's best-selling Alzheimer's disease treatment. The first generic donepezil became available in November 2010, with the US FDA approval of a formulation prepared by Ranbaxy Labs. == Research == Donepezil has been tested in other cognitive disorders, including Lewy body dementia, and vascular dementia, but it is not currently approved for these indications. Donepezil has also been found to improve sleep apnea in people with Alzheimer's. It also improves gait in people with mild Alzheimer's. Donepezil has also been studied in people with mild cognitive impairment, schizophrenia, attention deficit disorder, post-coronary artery bypass surgery cognitive impairment, cognitive impairment associated with multiple sclerosis, CADASIL syndrome, and Down syndrome. A three-year National Institutes of Health trial in people with mild cognitive impairment reported donepezil was superior to placebo in delaying rate of progression to dementia during the initial 18 months of the study, but this was not sustained at 36 months. In a secondary analysis, a subgroup of individuals with the apolipoprotein E4 genotype showed sustained benefits with donepezil throughout the study. At this time, though, donepezil is not indicated for prevention of dementia. === Cognitive enhancement === Donepezil has shown mixed results for improving cognitive abilities in healthy individuals. A 2009 double-blind, placebo controlled study (n=24) investigating donepezil's effects across a variety of memory tests in reported an improvement in spatial memory accuracy both before (90 minutes after dosing) and at theoretical Tmax (210 minutes after dosing). However, a later 2011 paper featuring two study double-blind, placebo controlled experiments evaluating donepezil's effects in older but healthy subjects reported impairment after acute (5 hours after dose) and chronic (4 weeks) donepezil administration. === ADHD === The addition of donepezil with existing ADHD medications has shown mixed results. In those with Tourette syndrome and ADHD, donepezil may reduce tics while it had no effect on ADHD's symptoms. === Pervasive developmental disorder === Donepezil, along with other cholinesterase inhibitors, is suggested as having potential for trouble behaviors: irritability, hyperactivity, and difficulty in social communication which are typically seen in those with pervasive developmental disorder, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, and autism-spectrum disorder. === Anorexia nervosa === Donepezil is furthermore suggested as a feasible therapeutic option for anorexia nervosa. Emerging literature reports that a subset of patients suffering from restrictive anorexia nervosa have enhanced habit formation compared with healthy controls. Habit formation is modulated by striatal cholinergic interneurons. Based on the physiopathology of anorexia nervosa, namely in terms of cholinergic deficiencies, the effects of donepezil and other drugs that act as cholinesterase inhibitors could thus be effective in the treatment of the disorder. However, no trial to date supports this hypothesis. == References == == Further reading == Brenner GD, Brenner GM (2000). Pharmacology. Philadelphia: W. B. Saunders. ISBN 978-0-7216-7757-6.

         "Equol (4',7-isoflavandiol) is an isoflavandiol estrogen metabolized from daidzein, a type of isoflavone found in soybeans and other plant sources, by bacterial flora in the intestines. While endogenous estrogenic hormones such as estradiol are steroids, equol is a nonsteroidal estrogen. Only about 30–50% of people have intestinal bacteria that make equol. == History == (S)-Equol was first isolated from horse urine in 1932, and the name was suggested by this equine connection. Since then, equol has been found in the urine or plasma of many other animal species, although these animals have significant differences in their ability to metabolize daidzein into equol. In 1980, scientists reported the discovery of equol in humans. The ability of (S)-equol to play a role in the treatment of estrogen- or androgen-mediated diseases or disorders was first proposed in 1984. == Chemical structure == Equol is a compound that can exist in two mirror-image forms known as enantiomers: (S)-equol and (R)-equol. (S)-equol is produced in humans and animals with the ability to metabolize the soy isoflavone daidzein, while (R)-equol can be chemically synthesized. The molecular and physical structure of (S)-equol is similar to that of the hormone estradiol. (S)-Equol preferentially binds estrogen receptor beta. == Pharmacology == === Estrogen receptor binding === (S)-equol is a nonsteroidal, selective agonist of ERβ (Ki = 16 nM) with 13-fold selectivity for ERβ over ERα. Relative to (S)-equol, (R)-equol is less potent and binds to ERα (Ki = 50 nM) with 3.5-fold selectivity over ERβ. (S)-Equol has about 2% of estradiol's binding affinity for human estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and 20% of estradiol's binding affinity for human estrogen receptor beta (ERβ). The preferential binding of (S)-equol to ERβ vs. ERα and in comparison to that of estradiol suggests the molecule may share some of the characteristics of a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Equol has been found to act as an agonist of the GPER (GPR30). === Pharmacokinetics === (S)-Equol is a very stable molecule that essentially remains unchanged when digested, and this lack of further metabolism explains its very quick absorption and high bioavailability. When (S)-equol is consumed, it is rapidly absorbed and achieves a Tmax (rate of peak plasma concentration) in two to three hours. In comparison, the Tmax of daidzein is 4 to 10 hours because daidzein exists in glycoside (with a glucose side chain) form. The body must convert daidzein to its aglycone form (without the glucose side chain) via removal of the sugar side chain during digestion before it can use daidzein. If consumed directly in aglycone form, daidzein has a Tmax of one to three hours. The percent fractional elimination of (S)-equol in urine after oral administration is high and in some adults can reach close to 100 percent. The percent fractional elimination of daidzein is much lower at 30 to 40 percent. == Production in humans == To produce (S)-equol after soy consumption, humans must have certain strains of bacteria living within their intestines. Twenty-one different strains of intestinal bacteria cultured from humans have been shown to have the ability to transform daidzein into (S)-equol or a related intermediate compound. Several studies indicate that only 25 to 30 percent of the adult populations of Western countries produce (S)-equol after eating soy foods containing isoflavones, while 50 to 60 percent of adults from Japan, Korea, and China are equol-producers. Vegetarians have also been reported to be more capable of transforming daidzein into (S)-equol. Seaweed and dairy consumption can enhance the production of equol. The ability of a person to produce (S)-equol is determined by testing people who have not taken any antibiotics for at least a month. For this standardized test, the individual drinks two 240 milliliter glasses of soy milk or eats a soy food equivalent for three days. The (S)-equol concentration in each test subject's urine is determined on day four. === Equol producing bacteria === While many more bacteria are involved in the related intermediate process of equol production, such as conversion of daidzin to daidzein, or genistein to 5-Hydroxy-equol, the bacteria that achieve the complete conversion of daidzein to (S)-equol, include: Adlercreutzia equolifaciens Asaccharobacter celatus AHU1763 Bacteroides ovatus Bifidobacterium Bifidobacterium animalis Coriobacteriaceae sp MT1B9 Eggerthella sp YY7918 Enterococcus faecium Eubacterium sp D1 and D2 Finegoldia magna Lactobacillus mucosae Lactobacillus sp Niu-O16 Lactococcus garvieae (Lc 20-92) Ruminococcus productus Slackia sp HE8 Slackia equolifaciens (Strain DZE) Streptococcus intermedius Veillonella sp Conversion by Bifidobacterium has only been reported once by Tsangalis et al. in 2002 and not reproduced since.Bifidobacteria: Genomics and Molecular Aspects Mixed cultures such as Lactobacillus sp. Niu-O16 and Eggerthella sp. Julong 732 can also produce (S)-equol.Bifidobacteria: Genomics and Molecular Aspects Some equol producing bacteria, as implied by their nomenclature, are Adlercreutzia equolifaciens, Slackia equolifaciens and Slackia isoflavoniconvertens. == Health effects == === Skin health === The topical effects of equol as an anti-aging substance have been shown in different studies. The effects result from both molecular and structural changes to the skin. Equol can, for instance, lead to an increase in telomere length. As an antioxidant, equol can decrease the aging process by reducing damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). It may also act as a protective anti-photoaging substance by inhibiting acute UVA- induced lipid peroxidation. In addition, equol may have a positive impact on epigenetic regulation. Equol's phytoestrogenic properties may also affect skin health. Reduction of dark circles and eye wrinkles after treatment with equol has been reported. Equol may also protect skin from damage by pollution due to its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Each of the enantiomers and the racemic mixture of both enantiomers have different characteristics, bioavailabilities and molecular effects. According to one study, (RS)-equol provided the greatest overall improvement in skin health, especially when applied topically. === Hormone-related health effects === Beyond topical effects, medicinal equol has been shown to relieve menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and muscle and joint pain. (RS)-equol was also reported to reduce symptoms associated with menopausal vaginal atrophy, such as vaginal itching, vaginal dryness and pain with intercourse and cause positive shifts in the vaginal bacterial population, cell composition, and pH. According to animal studies, it has anti-androgenic effects and may lead to inhibited 5-alpha reductase as well as lowered dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels. == See also == Daidzein Estrogen receptor Genistein Liquiritigenin Menerba Prinaberel WAY-200070 Diarylpropionitrile == References ==",

The (S)-equol concentration in each test subject's urine is determined on day four. === Equol producing bacteria === While many more bacteria are involved in the related intermediate process of equol production, such as conversion of daidzin to daidzein, or genistein to 5-Hydroxy-equol, the bacteria that achieve the complete conversion of daidzein to (S)-equol, include: Adlercreutzia equolifaciens Asaccharobacter celatus AHU1763 Bacteroides ovatus Bifidobacterium Bifidobacterium animalis Coriobacteriaceae sp MT1B9 Eggerthella sp YY7918 Enterococcus faecium Eubacterium sp D1 and D2 Finegoldia magna Lactobacillus mucosae Lactobacillus sp Niu-O16 Lactococcus garvieae (Lc 20-92) Ruminococcus productus Slackia sp HE8 Slackia equolifaciens (Strain DZE) Streptococcus intermedius Veillonella sp Conversion by Bifidobacterium has only been reported once by Tsangalis et al. in 2002 and not reproduced since.Bifidobacteria: Genomics and Molecular Aspects Mixed cultures such as Lactobacillus sp. Niu-O16 and Eggerthella sp. Julong 732 can also produce (S)-equol.Bifidobacteria: Genomics and Molecular Aspects Some equol producing bacteria, as implied by their nomenclature, are Adlercreutzia equolifaciens, Slackia equolifaciens and Slackia isoflavoniconvertens. == Health effects == === Skin health === The topical effects of equol as an anti-aging substance have been shown in different studies. The effects result from both molecular and structural changes to the skin. Equol can, for instance, lead to an increase in telomere length. As an antioxidant, equol can decrease the aging process by reducing damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). It may also act as a protective anti-photoaging substance by inhibiting acute UVA- induced lipid peroxidation. In addition, equol may have a positive impact on epigenetic regulation. Equol's phytoestrogenic properties may also affect skin health. Reduction of dark circles and eye wrinkles after treatment with equol has been reported. Equol may also protect skin from damage by pollution due to its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Each of the enantiomers and the racemic mixture of both enantiomers have different characteristics, bioavailabilities and molecular effects. According to one study, (RS)-equol provided the greatest overall improvement in skin health, especially when applied topically. === Hormone-related health effects === Beyond topical effects, medicinal equol has been shown to relieve menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and muscle and joint pain. (RS)-equol was also reported to reduce symptoms associated with menopausal vaginal atrophy, such as vaginal itching, vaginal dryness and pain with intercourse and cause positive shifts in the vaginal bacterial population, cell composition, and pH. According to animal studies, it has anti-androgenic effects and may lead to inhibited 5-alpha reductase as well as lowered dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels. == See also == Daidzein Estrogen receptor Genistein Liquiritigenin Menerba Prinaberel WAY-200070 Diarylpropionitrile == References ==",

         "Medical",
         "Estramustine phosphate (EMP), also known as estradiol normustine phosphate and sold under the brand names Emcyt and Estracyt, is a dual estrogen and chemotherapy medication which is used in the treatment of prostate cancer in men. It is taken multiple times a day by mouth or by injection into a vein. Side effects of EMP include nausea, vomiting, gynecomastia, feminization, demasculinization, sexual dysfunction, blood clots, and cardiovascular complications. EMP is a dual cytostatic and hence chemotherapeutic agent and a hormonal anticancer agent of the estrogen type. It is a prodrug of estramustine and estromustine in terms of its cytostatic effects and a prodrug of estradiol in relation to its estrogenic effects. EMP has strong estrogenic effects at typical clinical dosages, and consequently has marked antigonadotropic and functional antiandrogenic effects. EMP was introduced for medical use in the early 1970s. It is available in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, other European countries, and elsewhere in the world. == Medical uses == EMP is indicated, in the United States, for the palliative treatment of metastatic and/or progressive prostate cancer, whereas in the United Kingdom it is indicated for the treatment of unresponsive or relapsing prostate cancer. The medication is usually reserved for use in hormone-refractory cases of prostate cancer, although it has been used as a first-line monotherapy as well. Response rates with EMP in prostate cancer are said to be equivalent to conventional high-dose estrogen therapy. Due to its relatively severe side effects and toxicity, EMP has rarely been used in the treatment of prostate cancer. This is especially true in Western countries today. As a result, and also due to the scarce side effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormone modulators (GnRH modulators) like leuprorelin, EMP was almost abandoned. However, encouraging clinical research findings resulted in renewed interest of EMP for the treatment of prostate cancer. EMP has been used at doses of 140 to 1,400 mg/day orally in the treatment of prostate cancer. However, oral EMP is most commonly used at a dose of 560 to 640 mg/day (280–320 mg twice daily). The recommended dosage of oral EMP in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) label for Emcyt is 14 mg per kg of body weight (i.e., one 140 mg oral capsule for each 10 kg or 22 lbs of body weight) given in 3 or 4 divided doses per day. The label states that most patients in studies of oral EMP in the United States have received 10 to 16 mg per kg per day. This would be about 900 to 1,440 mg/day for a 90-kg or 200-lb man. Lower doses of oral EMP, such as 280 mg/day, have been found to have comparable effectiveness as higher doses but with improved tolerability and reduced toxicity. Doses of 140 mg/day have been described as a very low dosage. EMP has been used at doses of 240 to 450 mg/day intravenously. EMP and other estrogens such as polyestradiol phosphate and ethinylestradiol are far less costly than newer therapies such as GnRH modulators, abiraterone acetate, and enzalutamide. In addition, estrogens may offer significant benefits over other means of androgen deprivation therapy, for instance in terms of bone loss and fractures, hot flashes, cognition, and metabolic status. EMP has been used to prevent the testosterone flare at the start of GnRH agonist therapy in men with prostate cancer. === Available forms === EMP is or has been available in the form of both capsules (140 mg, 280 mg) for oral administration and aqueous solutions (300 mg) for intravenous injection. == Contraindications == EMP is contraindicated when used in children, patients hypersensitive to estrogens or nitrogen mustards, those with peptic ulcer (an ulcer in the digestive tract), those with severely compromised liver function, those with weak heart muscle (also known as myocardial insufficiency) and those with thromboembolic disorders or complications related to fluid retention. == Side effects == The side effects of EMP overall have been described as relatively severe. The most common side effects of EMP have been reported to be gastrointestinal side effects like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, with nausea and vomiting occurring in 40% of men. They are usually mild or moderate in severity, and the nausea and vomiting can be managed with prophylactic antiemetic medications. Nonetheless, severe cases of gastrointestinal side effects with EMP may require dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy. Although nausea and vomiting have been reported to be the most common side effects of EMP, gynecomastia (male breast development) has been found to occur in as many as 83% of men treated with EMP, and the incidence of erectile dysfunction is possibly similar to or slightly less than the risk of gynecomastia. As a rule, feminization, a gynoid fat distribution, demasculinization, and impotence are said to occur in virtually or nearly 100% of men treated with high-dose estrogen therapy. Decreased sexual activity has also been reported in men treated with EMP. These side effects are due to high estrogen levels and low testosterone levels. Prophylactic irradiation of the breasts can be used to decrease the incidence and severity of gynecomastia with estrogens. Severe adverse effects of EMP are thromboembolic and cardiovascular complications including pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, stroke, thrombophlebitis, coronary artery disease (ischemic heart disease; e.g., myocardial infarction), thrombophlebitis, and congestive heart failure with fluid retention. EMP produces cardiovascular toxicity similarly to diethylstilbestrol, but to a lesser extent in comparison at low doses (e.g., 280 mg/day oral EMP vs. 1 mg/day oral diethylstilbestrol). The prostate cancer disease state also increases the risk of thromboembolism, and combination with docetaxel may exacerbate the risk of thromboembolism as well. Meta-analyses of clinical trials have found that the overall risk of thromboembolism with EMP is 4 to 7%, relative to 0.4% for chemotherapy regimens without EMP. Thromboembolism is the major toxicity-related cause of discontinuation of EMP. Anticoagulant therapy with medications such as aspirin, warfarin, unfractionated and low-molecular-weight heparin, and vitamin K antagonists can be useful for decreasing the risk of thromboembolism with EMP and other estrogens like diethylstilbestrol and ethinylestradiol. Adverse liver function tests are commonly seen with EMP, but severe liver dysfunction is rare with the medication. Central nervous system side effects are rarely seen with EMP, although enlarged ventricles and neuronal pigmentation have been reported in monkeys treated with very high doses of EMP (20–140 mg/kg/day) for 3 to 6 months. EMP does not appear to have cytostatic effects in normal brain tissue. In women treated with EMP in clinical studies, a few instances of minor gynecological hemorrhages have been observed. EMP is described as relatively well tolerated among cytostatic antineoplastic and nitrogen-mustard agents, rarely or not at all being associated with significant hematologic toxicity such as myelosuppression (bone marrow suppression), gastrointestinal toxicity, or other more marked toxicity associated with such agents. In contrast to most other cytostatic agents, which often cause myelosuppression, leukopenia (decreased white blood cell count), and neutropenia (decreased neutrophil count), EMP actually produces leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count) as a side effect. In a small low-dose study using 280 mg/day oral EMP for 150 days, tolerability was significantly improved, with gastrointestinal irritation occurring in only 15% of men, and there was no incidence of severe cardiovascular toxicity or deep vein thrombosis. In addition, no other side effects besides slight transient elevated liver enzymes were observed. These findings suggest that lower doses of oral EMP may be a safer option than higher doses for the treatment of prostate cancer. However, a subsequent 2004 meta-analysis of 23 studies of thromboembolic events with EMP found substantial incidence of thromboembolic events regardless of dosage and no association of EMP dose with risk of these complications. == Overdose == There has been no clinical experience with overdose of EMP. Overdose of EMP may result in pronounced manifestations of the known adverse effects of the medication. There is no specific antidote for overdose of EMP. In the event of overdose, gastric lavage should be used to evacuate gastric contents as necessary and treatment should be symptom-based and supportive. In the case of dangerously low counts of red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets, whole blood may be given as needed. Liver function should be monitored with EMP overdose. After an overdose of EMP, hematological and hepatic parameters should continue to be monitored for at least 6 weeks. EMP has been used at high doses of as much as 1,260 mg/day by the oral route and 240 to 450 mg/day by intravenous injection. == Interactions == EMP has been reported to increase the efficacy and toxicity of tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline and imipramine. When products containing calcium, aluminium, and/or magnesium, such as dairy products like milk, various foods dietary supplements, and antacids, are consumed concomitantly with EMP, an insoluble chelate complex/phosphate salt between EMP and these metals can be formed, and this can markedly impair the absorption and hence oral bioavailability of EMP. There may be an increased risk of angioedema in those concurrently taking ACE inhibitors. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === EMP, also known as estradiol normustine phosphate, is a combined estrogen ester and nitrogen mustard ester. It consists of estradiol, an estrogen, linked with a phosphate ester as well as an ester of normustine, a nitrogen mustard. In terms of its pharmacodynamic effects, EMP is a prodrug of estramustine, estromustine, and estradiol. As a prodrug of estradiol, EMP is an estrogen and hence an agonist of the estrogen receptors. EMP itself has only very weak affinity for the estrogen receptors. The medication is of about 91% higher molecular weight than estradiol due to the presence of its C3 normustine and C17β phosphate esters. Because EMP is a prodrug of estradiol, it may be considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of estrogen, although it does have additional cytostatic activity via estramustine and estromustine. EMP acts by a dual mechanism of action: 1) direct cytostatic activity via a number of actions; and 2) as a form of high-dose estrogen therapy via estrogen receptor-mediated antigonadotropic and functional antiandrogenic effects. The antigonadotropic and functional antiandrogenic effects of EMP consist of strong suppression of gonadal androgen production and hence circulating levels of androgens such as testosterone; greatly increased levels of sex hormone-binding globulin and hence a decreased fraction of free androgens in the circulation; and direct antiandrogenic actions in prostate cells. The free androgen index with oral EMP has been found to be on average 4.6-fold lower than with orchiectomy. As such, EMP therapy results in considerably stronger androgen deprivation than orchiectomy. Metabolites of EMP, including estramustine, estromustine, estradiol, and estrone, have been found to act as weak antagonists of the androgen receptor (EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration = 0.5–3.1 μM), although the clinical significance of this is unknown. Extremely high levels of estradiol and estrone occur during EMP therapy. The estrogenic metabolites of EMP are responsible for its most common adverse effects and its cardiovascular toxicity. EMP has been described as having relatively weak estrogenic effects in some publications. However, it has shown essentially the same rates and degrees of estrogenic effects, such as breast tenderness, gynecomastia, cardiovascular toxicity, changes in liver protein synthesis, and testosterone suppression, as high-dose diethylstilbestrol and ethinylestradiol in clinical studies. The notion that EMP has relatively weak estrogen activity may have been based on animal research, which found that EMP had 100-fold lower uterotrophic effects than estradiol in rats, and may also not have taken into account the very high doses of EMP used clinically in humans. The mechanism of action of the cytostatic effects of EMP is complex and only partially understood. EMP is considered to mainly be a mitotic inhibitor, inhibiting mechanisms involved in the mitosis phase of the cell cycle. Specifically, it binds to microtubule-associated proteins and/or to tubulin and produces depolymerization of microtubules (Kd = 10–20 μM for estramustine), resulting in the arrest of cell division in the G2/M phase (specifically metaphase). EMP was originally thought to mediate its cytostatic effects as a prodrug of normustine, a nitrogen mustard, and hence was thought to be an alkylating antineoplastic agent. However, subsequent research has found that EMP is devoid of alkylating actions, and that the influence of EMP on microtubules is mediated by intact estramustine and estromustine, with normustine or estradiol alone having only minor or negligible effects. As such, the unique properties of the estramustine and estromustine structures, containing a carbamate-ester bond, appear to be responsible for the cytostatic effects of EMP. In addition to its antimitotic actions, EMP has also been found to produce other cytostatic effects, including induction of apoptosis, interference with DNA synthesis, nuclear matrix interaction, cell membrane alterations, induction of reactive oxygen species (free oxygen radicals), and possibly additional mechanisms. EMP has been found to have a radiosensitizing effect in prostate cancer and glioma cells, improving sensitivity to radiation therapy as well. The cytostatic metabolites of EMP are accumulated in tissues in a selective manner, for instance in prostate cancer cells. This may be due to the presence of a specific estramustine-binding protein (EMBP) (Kd = 10–35 nM for estramustine), also known as prostatin or prostatic secretion protein (PSP), which has been detected in prostate cancer, glioma, melanoma, and breast cancer cells. Because of its tissue selectivity, EMP is said to produce minimal cytostatic effects in healthy tissues, and its tissue selectivity may be responsible for its therapeutic cytostatic efficacy against prostate cancer cells. EMP was originally developed as a dual ester prodrug of an estrogen and normustine as a nitrogen mustard alkylating antineoplastic agent which, due to the affinity of the estrogen moiety for estrogen receptors, would be selectively accumulated in estrogen target tissues and hence estrogen receptor-positive tumor cells. Consequentially, it was thought that EMP would preferentially deliver the alkylating normustine moiety to these tissues, allowing for reduced cytostatic effects in healthy tissues and hence improved efficacy and tolerability. However, subsequent research found that there is very limited and slow cleavage of the normustine ester and that EMP is devoid of alkylating activity. In addition, it appears that estramustine and estromustine may be preferentially accumulated in estrogen target tissues not due to affinity for the estrogen receptors, but instead due to affinity for the distinct EMBP. Extremely high, pregnancy-like levels of estradiol may be responsible for the leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count) that is observed in individuals treated with EMP. This side effect is in contrast to most other cytotoxic agents, which instead cause myelosuppression (bone marrow suppression), leukopenia (decreased white blood cell count), and neutropenia (decreased neutrophil count). ==== Antigonadotropic effects ==== EMP at a dosage 280 mg/day has been found to suppress testosterone levels in men into the castrate range (to 30 ng/dL) within 20 days and to the low castrate range (to 10 ng/dL) within 30 days. Similarly, a dosage of 70 mg/day EMP suppressed testosterone levels into the castrate range within 4 weeks. === Pharmacokinetics === Upon oral ingestion, EMP is rapidly and completely dephosphorylated by phosphatases into estramustine during the first pass in the gastrointestinal tract. Estramustine is also partially but considerably oxidized into estromustine by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases during the first pass. As such, EMP reaches the circulation as estramustine and estromustine, and the major metabolite of EMP is estromustine. A limited quantity of approximately 10 to 15% of estramustine and estromustine is further slowly metabolized via hydrolysis of the normustine ester into estradiol and estrone, respectively. This reaction is believed to be catalyzed by carbamidases, although the genes encoding the responsible enzymes have not been characterized. The circulating levels of normustine formed from EMP are insignificant. Release of nitrogen mustard gas from normustine via cleavage of the carboxylic acid group has not been demonstrated and does not seem to occur. The oral bioavailability of EMP is low, which is due to profound first-pass metabolism; specifically, dephosphorylation of EMP. The oral bioavailability of EMP specifically as estramustine and estromustine is 44 to 75%, suggesting that absorption may be incomplete. In any case, there is a linear relationship between the oral dose of EMP and circulating levels of estramustine and estromustine. Consumption of calcium, aluminium, or magnesium with oral EMP can markedly impair its bioavailability due to diminished absorption from the intestines, and this may interfere with its therapeutic effectiveness at low doses. Following a single oral dose of 420 mg EMP in men with prostate cancer, maximal levels of estromustine were 310 to 475 ng/mL (475,000 pg/mL) and occurred after 2 to 3 hours. Estradiol levels with 280 mg/day oral EMP have been found to increase to very high concentrations within one week of therapy. In one study, levels of estradiol were over 20,000 pg/mL after 10 days, were about 30,000 pg/mL after 30 days, and peaked at about 40,000 pg/mL at 50 days. Another study found lower estradiol levels of 4,900 to 9,000 pg/mL during chronic therapy with 560 mg/day oral EMP. An additional study found estradiol levels of about 17,000 pg/mL with 140 mg/day oral EMP and 38,000 pg/mL with 280 mg/day oral EMP. The circulating levels of estradiol and estrone during EMP therapy have been reported to exceed normal levels in men by more than 100- and 1,000-fold, respectively. Levels of estramustine and estradiol in the circulation are markedly lower than those of estromustine and estrone, respectively, with a ratio of about 1:10 in both cases. Nonetheless, estradiol levels during EMP therapy appear to be similar to those that occur in mid-to-late pregnancy, which range from 5,000 to 40,000 pg/mL. No unchanged EMP is seen in the circulation with oral administration. The pharmacokinetics of EMP are different with intravenous injection. Following a single intravenous injection of 300 mg EMP, levels of EMP were higher than those of its metabolites for the first 8 hours. This is likely due to the bypassing of first-pass metabolism. However, by 24 hours after the dose, unchanged EMP could no longer be detected in the circulation. The clearance of EMP from blood plasma is 4.85 ± 0.684 L/h. The volumes of distribution of EMP with intravenous injection were small; under a two-compartment model, the volume of distribution for the central compartment was 0.043 L/kg and for the peripheral compartment was 0.11 L/kg. The plasma protein binding of EMP is high. Estramustine is accumulated in tumor tissue, for instance prostate cancer and glioma tissue, with estramustine levels much higher in these tissues than in plasma (e.g., 6.3- and 15.9-fold, respectively). Conversely, levels of estromustine in tumor versus plasma are similar (1.0- and 0.5-fold, respectively). Estramustine and estromustine appear to accumulate in adipose tissue. The elimination half-life of estromustine with oral EMP was 13.6 hours on average, with a range of 8.8 to 22.7 hours. Conversely, the elimination half-life of estromustine with intravenous injection was 10.3 hours, with a range of 7.36 to 12.3 hours. For comparison, the corresponding elimination half-lives of estrone were 16.5 and 14.7 hours for oral and intravenous administration, respectively. Estramustine and estromustine are mainly excreted in bile and hence in feces. They are not believed to be excreted in urine. == Chemistry == EMP, also known as estradiol 3-normustine 17β-phosphate or as estradiol 3-(bis(2-chloroethyl)carbamate) 17β-(dihydrogen phosphate), is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of estradiol. It is an estrogen ester; specifically, EMP is a diester of estradiol with a C3 normustine (nitrogen mustard–carbamate moiety) ester and a C17β phosphate ester. EMP is provided as the sodium or meglumine salt. EMP is similar as a compound to other estradiol esters such as estradiol sulfate and estradiol valerate, but differs in the presence of its nitrogen mustard ester moiety. Antineoplastic agents related to EMP, although none of them were marketed, include alestramustine, atrimustine, cytestrol acetate, estradiol mustard, ICI-85966, and phenestrol. Due to its hydrophilic phosphate ester moiety, EMP is a readily water-soluble compound. This is in contrast to most other estradiol esters, which are fatty acid esters and lipophilic compounds that are not particularly soluble in water. Unlike EMP, estramustine is highly lipophilic, practically insoluble in water, and non-ionizable. The phosphate ester of EMP was incorporated into the molecule in order to increase its water solubility and allow for intravenous administration. The molecular weight of EMP sodium is 564.3 g/mol, of EMP meglumine is 715.6 g/mol, of EMP is 520.4 g/mol, of estramustine is 440.4 g/mol, and of estradiol is 272.4 g/mol. As a result of these differences in molecular weights, EMP contains about 52%, EMP sodium about 48%, and EMP meglumine about 38% of the amount of estradiol within their structures as does an equal-mass quantity of estradiol. == History == EMP was first synthesized in the mid-1960s and was patented in 1967. It was initially developed for the treatment of breast cancer. The idea for EMP was inspired by the uptake and accumulation of radiolabeled estrogens into breast cancer tissue. However, initial clinical findings of EMP in women with breast cancer were disappointing. Subsequently, radiolabeled EMP was found to be taken up into and accumulated rat prostate gland, and this finding culminated in the medication being repurposed for the treatment of prostate cancer. EMP was introduced for medical use in the treatment of this condition in the early 1970s, and was approved in the United States for this indication in 1981. EMP was originally introduced for use by intravenous injection. Subsequently, an oral formulation was introduced, and the intravenous preparation was almost abandoned in favor of the oral version. == Society and culture == === Generic names === EMP is provided as the sodium salt for oral administration, which has the generic names estramustine phosphate sodium (USANTooltip United States Adopted Name) and estramustine sodium phosphate (BANMTooltip British Approved Name, JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name), and as the meglumine salt for intravenous administration, which has the generic name estramustine phosphate meglumine. The INNMTooltip International Nonproprietary Name is estramustine phosphate. The name estramustine phosphate is a contraction of estradiol normustine phosphate. EMP is also known by its former developmental code names Leo 299, Ro 21-8837, and Ro 21-8837/001. === Brand names === EMP is most commonly marketed under the brand names Estracyt and Emcyt, but has also been sold under a number of other brand names, including Amsupros, Biasetyl, Cellmustin, Estramustin HEXAL, Estramustina Filaxis, Estranovag, Multosin, Multosin Injekt, Proesta, Prostamustin, and Suloprost. === Availability === EMP is marketed in the United States, Canada, and Mexico under the brand name Emcyt, whereas the medication is marketed under the brand name Estracyt in the United Kingdom and elsewhere throughout Europe as well as in Argentina, Chile, and Hong Kong.

         " Mycosis fungoides (MF) is a subtype of CTCL with a low incidence and high medical need for novel treatments. The objective of this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, first-in-human study was to evaluate safety, efficacy, cutaneous and systemic pharmacokinetics (PK) of topical bimiralisib in healthy volunteers (HVs) and MF patients. In this trial, a total of 6 HVs and 19 early-stage MF patients were treated with 2.0% bimiralisib gel and/or placebo. Drug efficacy was assessed by the Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity (CAILS) score, supported by objective measuring methods to quantify lesion severity. PK blood samples were collected frequently and cutaneous PK was investigated in skin punch biopsies on the last day of treatment. Local distribution of bimiralisib in HVs showed a mean exposure of 2.54 µg/g in the epidermis. A systemic concentration was observed after application of a target dose of 2 mg/cm PI3K/mTOR inhibition leads to apoptosis of NOTCH1-mutant head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. We tested the efficacy of the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor bimiralisib in patients with NOTCH1-mutant HNSCC. Patients with recurrent/metastatic NOTCH1-mutant HNSCC who had progressed during chemotherapy and immunotherapy received bimiralisib until unacceptable toxicity or progression. To assess whether NOTCH1 mutations can be detected in blood, we measured circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). To assess activated NOTCH1 protein levels, we quantitated cleaved NOTCH1 (cl-NOTCH) by immunohistochemistry. Eight patients were treated, and 6 were evaluable for response. The objective response rate was 17%. For all 8 patients, median progression-free and overall survival was 5 and 7 months, respectively. Bimiralisib was well tolerated, with expected hyperglycemia. Pharmacokinetic values were consistent with published studies. NOTCH1 mutations were detected in 83.3% of ctDNA. Staining for tumor cl-NOTCH1 was negative. The trial closed early due to sponsor insolvency. Although the trial was small, outcomes with bimiralisib were better than the historical standard of care; Results will need to be confirmed in a larger trial. The lack of cl-NOTCH1 was consistent with loss-of-function mutations and validated our mutation function algorithm. The ability to detect NOTCH1 mutations in blood will help future studies. (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03740100). Bimiralisib is a pan-PI3K/mTOR inhibitor demonstrating antitumor efficacy in preclinical models. The objectives of this study were to identify a maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics (PK), a dosing schedule, and adverse events (AEs) in patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients received oral bimiralisib to determine the MTD of one continuous (once daily) and two intermittent schedules (A: Days 1, 2 weekly; B: Days 1, 4 weekly) until progression or unacceptable AEs occurred. The MTD for the continuous schedule was 80 mg, with grade three fatigue as the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). No MTD was reached with intermittent schedules, with only one DLT in schedule B. PK analysis suggested that 140 mg (schedule A) was within the biologically active dose range and was selected for further exploration. The most frequent treatment-emergent AEs were hyperglycemia (76.2%) in the continuous schedule, and nausea (56-62.5%) in schedules A and B. The most frequent treatment-emergent > grade three AE for all schedules combined was hyperglycemia (28.6%, continuous schedule; 12.0%, schedule A; 12.5%, schedule B). There was one partial response in a head and neck squamous cancer patient with a NOTCH1 Bimiralisib demonstrated a manageable AE profile consistent with this compound class. Intermittent schedules had fewer > grade three AEs, while also maintaining favorable PK profiles. Intermittent schedule A is proposed for further development in biomarker-selected patient populations.",

Cysteine is formed from cystathionine via the cystathionine gamma-lyase enzyme, and is either broken down by cysteine lyase or cystathionine gamma-lyase or enters the cysteine sulfinic acid pathway where it is oxidized by cysteine dioxygenase to form cysteine sulfinic acid. Cysteine sulfinic acid, in turn, is decarboxylated by sulfinoalanine decarboxylase to form hypotaurine, which in turn is oxidized by hypotaurine dehydrogenase to yield taurine.

         "Medical",
         "Tranylcypromine, sold under the brand name Parnate among others, is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). More specifically, tranylcypromine acts as nonselective and irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO). It is used as an antidepressant and anxiolytic agent in the clinical treatment of mood and anxiety disorders, respectively. It is also effective in the treatment of ADHD. Tranylcypromine is also known as trans-2-phenylcyclopropyl-1-amine and is formed pro forma from the cyclization of amphetamine's isopropylamine side chain. As a result, it is classified structurally as a substituted phenethylamine and amphetamine. == Medical uses == Tranylcypromine is used to treat major depressive disorder, including atypical depression, especially when there is an anxiety component, typically as a second-line treatment. It is also used in depression that is not responsive to reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, such as the SSRIs, TCAs, or bupropion. In addition to being a recognized treatment for major depressive disorder, tranylcypromine has been demonstrated to be effective in treating obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have reported that tranylcypromine is significantly more effective in the treatment of depression than placebo and has efficacy over placebo similar to that of other antidepressants such as tricyclic antidepressants. == Contraindications == Contraindications include: Porphyria Cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease Pheochromocytoma Tyramine, found in several foods, is metabolized by MAO. Ingestion and absorption of tyramine causes extensive release of norepinephrine, which can rapidly increase blood pressure to the point of causing hypertensive crisis. Concomitant use of serotonin-enhancing drugs, including SSRIs, serotonergic TCAs, dextromethorphan, and meperidine may cause serotonin syndrome. Concomitant use of MRAs, including fenfluramine, amphetamine, and pseudoephedrine may cause toxicity via serotonin syndrome or hypertensive crisis. L-DOPA given without carbidopa may cause hypertensive crisis. === Dietary restrictions === Tyramine is a biogenic amine produced as a (generally undesirable) byproduct during the fermentation of certain tyrosine-rich foods. It is rapidly metabolized by MAO-A in those not taking MAO-inhibiting drugs. Individuals sensitive to tyramine-induced hypertension may experience an uncomfortable, yet fleeting, increase in blood pressure after ingesting relatively small amounts of tyramine. Advances in food safety standards in most nations, as well as the widespread use of starter-cultures shown to result in undetectable to low levels of tyramine in fermented products has rendered concerns of serious hypertensive crises rare in those consuming a modern diet. Those treated with MAOIs should still exercise caution, particularly at home, if it is unclear whether food has been properly refrigerated. Since tyramine-producing microbes also produce compounds to which humans have a natural aversion, disposal of any questionable food—particularly meats—should be sufficient to avoid hypertensive crises. == Adverse effects == Incidence of adverse effects Very common (>10% incidence) adverse effects include: Dizziness secondary to orthostatic hypotension (17%) Common (1-10% incidence) adverse effects include: Tachycardia (5–10%) Hypomania (7%) Paresthesia (5%) Weight loss (2%) Confusion (2%) Dry mouth (2%) Sexual function disorders (2%) Hypertension (1–2 hours after ingestion) (2%) Rash (2%) Urinary retention (2%) Other (unknown incidence) adverse effects include: Increased/decreased appetite Blood dyscrasias Chest pain Diarrhea Edema Hallucinations Hyperreflexia Insomnia Jaundice Leg cramps Myalgia Palpitations Sensation of cold Suicidal ideation Tremor Of note, there has not been found to be a correlation between sex and age below 65 regarding incidence of adverse effects. Tranylcypromine is not associated with weight gain and has a low risk for hepatotoxicity compared to the hydrazine MAOIs. It is generally recommended that MAOIs be discontinued prior to anesthesia; however, this creates a risk of recurrent depression. In a retrospective observational cohort study, patients on tranylcypromine undergoing general anesthesia had a lower incidence of intraoperative hypotension, while there was no difference between patients not taking an MAOI regarding intraoperative incidence of bradycardia, tachycardia, or hypertension. The use of indirect sympathomimetic drugs or drugs affecting serotonin reuptake, such as meperidine or dextromethorphan poses a risk for hypertension and serotonin syndrome respectively; alternative agents are recommended. Other studies have come to similar conclusions. Pharmacokinetic interactions with anesthetics are unlikely, given that tranylcypromine is a high-affinity substrate for CYP2A6 and does not inhibit CYP enzymes at therapeutic concentrations. Tranylcypromine abuse has been reported at doses ranging from 120 to 600 mg per day. It is thought that higher doses have more amphetamine-like effects and abuse is promoted by the fast onset and short half-life of tranylcypromine. Cases of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during tranylcypromine therapy or early after treatment discontinuation. Symptoms of tranylcypromine overdose are generally more intense manifestations of its usual effects. == Interactions == In addition to contraindicated concomitant medications, tranylcypromine inhibits CYP2A6, which may reduce the metabolism and increase the toxicity of substrates of this enzyme, such as: Dexmedetomidine nicotine TSNAs (found in cured tobacco products, including cigarettes) Valproate Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors prevent neuronal uptake of tyramine and may reduce its pressor effects. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Tranylcypromine acts as a nonselective and irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase. Regarding the isoforms of monoamine oxidase, it shows slight preference for the MAOB isoenzyme over MAOA. This leads to an increase in the availability of monoamines, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, epinephrine as well as a marked increase in the availability of trace amines, such as tryptamine, octopamine, and phenethylamine. The clinical relevance of increased trace amine availability is unclear. It may also act as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor at higher therapeutic doses. Compared to amphetamine, tranylcypromine shows low potency as a dopamine releasing agent, with even weaker potency for norepinephrine and serotonin release. Tranylcypromine has also been shown to inhibit the histone demethylase, BHC110/LSD1. Tranylcypromine inhibits this enzyme with an IC50 < 2 μM, thus acting as a small molecule inhibitor of histone demethylation with an effect to derepress the transcriptional activity of BHC110/LSD1 target genes. The clinical relevance of this effect is unknown. Tranylcypromine has been found to inhibit CYP46A1 at nanomolar concentrations. The clinical relevance of this effect is unknown. === Pharmacokinetics === Tranylcypromine reaches its maximum concentration (tmax) within 1–2 hours. After a 20 mg dose, plasma concentrations reach at most 50-200 ng/mL. While its half-life is only about 2 hours, its pharmacodynamic effects last several days to weeks due to irreversible inhibition of MAO. Metabolites of tranylcypromine include 4-hydroxytranylcypromine, N-acetyltranylcypromine, and N-acetyl-4-hydroxytranylcypromine, which are less potent MAO inhibitors than tranylcypromine itself. Amphetamine was once thought to be a metabolite of tranylcypromine, but has not been shown to be. Tranylcypromine inhibits CYP2A6 at therapeutic concentrations. == Chemistry == === Synthesis === == History == Tranylcypromine was originally developed as an analog of amphetamine. Although it was first synthesized in 1948, its MAOI action was not discovered until 1959. Precisely because tranylcypromine was not, like isoniazid and iproniazid, a hydrazine derivative, its clinical interest increased enormously, as it was thought it might have a more acceptable therapeutic index than previous MAOIs. The drug was introduced by Smith, Kline and French in the United Kingdom in 1960, and approved in the United States in 1961. It was withdrawn from the market in February 1964 due to a number of patient deaths involving hypertensive crises with intracranial bleeding. However, it was reintroduced later that year with more limited indications and specific warnings of the risks. == Research == Tranylcypromine is known to inhibit LSD1, an enzyme that selectively demethylates two lysines found on histone H3. Genes promoted downstream of LSD1 are involved in cancer cell growth and metastasis, and several tumor cells express high levels of LSD1. Tranylcypromine analogues with more potent and selective LSD1 inhibitory activity are being researched in the potential treatment of cancers. Tranylcypromine may have neuroprotective properties applicable to the treatment of Parkinson's disease, similar to the MAO-B inhibitors selegiline and rasagiline. As of 2017, only one clinical trial in Parkinsonian patients has been conducted, which found some improvement initially and only slight worsening of symptoms after a 1.5 year followup. == See also == Tranylcypromine/trifluoperazine == References ==",

         "Glycolic acid (or hydroxyacetic acid; chemical formula HOCH2CO2H) is a colorless, odorless and hygroscopic crystalline solid, highly soluble in water. It is used in various skin-care products. Glycolic acid is widespread in nature. A glycolate (sometimes spelled \"glycollate\") is a salt or ester of glycolic acid. == History == The name \"glycolic acid\" was coined in 1848 by French chemist Auguste Laurent (1807–1853). He proposed that the amino acid glycine—which was then called glycocolle—might be the amine of a hypothetical acid, which he called \"glycolic acid\" (acide glycolique). Glycolic acid was first prepared in 1851 by German chemist Adolph Strecker (1822–1871) and Russian chemist Nikolai Nikolaevich Sokolov (1826–1877). They produced it by treating hippuric acid with nitric acid and nitrogen dioxide to form an ester of benzoic acid and glycolic acid (C6H5C(=O)OCH2COOH), which they called \"benzoglycolic acid\" (Benzoglykolsäure; also benzoyl glycolic acid). They boiled the ester for days with dilute sulfuric acid, thereby obtaining benzoic acid and glycolic acid (Glykolsäure). == Preparation == Glycolic acid can be synthesized in various ways. The predominant approaches use a catalyzed reaction of formaldehyde with synthesis gas (carbonylation of formaldehyde), for its low cost. It is also prepared by the reaction of chloroacetic acid with sodium hydroxide followed by re-acidification. Other methods, not noticeably in use, include hydrogenation of oxalic acid, and hydrolysis of the cyanohydrin derived from formaldehyde. Some of today's glycolic acids are formic acid-free. Glycolic acid can be isolated from natural sources, such as sugarcane, sugar beets, pineapple, cantaloupe and unripe grapes. Glycolic acid can also be prepared using an enzymatic biochemical process that may require less energy. == Properties == Glycolic acid is slightly stronger than acetic acid due to the electron-withdrawing power of the terminal hydroxyl group. The carboxylate group can coordinate to metal ions, forming coordination complexes. Of particular note are the complexes with Pb2+ and Cu2+ which are significantly stronger than complexes with other carboxylic acids. This indicates that the hydroxyl group is involved in complex formation, possibly with the loss of its proton. == Applications == Glycolic acid is used in the textile industry as a dyeing and tanning agent. === Organic synthesis === Glycolic acid is a useful intermediate for organic synthesis, in a range of reactions including: oxidation-reduction, esterification and long chain polymerization. It is used as a monomer in the preparation of polyglycolic acid and other biocompatible copolymers (e.g. PLGA). Commercially, important derivatives include the methyl (CAS# 96-35-5) and ethyl (CAS# 623-50-7) esters which are readily distillable (boiling points 147–149 °C and 158–159 °C, respectively), unlike the parent acid. The butyl ester (b.p. 178–186 °C) is a component of some varnishes, being desirable because it is nonvolatile and has good dissolving properties. == Occurrence == Plants produce glycolic acid during photorespiration. It is recycled by conversion to glycine within the peroxisomes and to tartronic acid semialdehyde within the chloroplasts. Because photorespiration is a wasteful side reaction in regard to photosynthesis, much effort has been devoted to suppressing its formation. One process converts glycolate into glycerate without using the conventional BASS6 and PLGG1 route; see glycerate pathway. == Safety == Glycolic acid is an irritant to the skin. It occurs in all green plants. == References == == External links == Glycolic acid MS Spectrum Hazardous Substances Data Bank",

         "Ethionamide is an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis. Specifically it is used, along with other antituberculosis medications, to treat active multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. It is no longer recommended for leprosy. It is taken by mouth. Ethionamide has a high rate of side effects. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite. Serious side effects may include liver inflammation and depression. It should not be used in people with significant liver problems. Use in pregnancy is not recommended as safety is unclear. Ethionamide is in the thioamides family of medications. It is believed to work by interfering with the use of mycolic acid. Ethionamide was discovered in 1956 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1965. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Ethionamide is used in combination with other antituberculosis agents as part of a second-line regimen for active tuberculosis. Ethionamide is well absorbed orally with or without food, but is often administered with food to improve tolerance. It crosses the blood brain barrier to achieve concentrations in the cerebral-spinal fluid equivalent to plasma. The antimicrobial spectrum of ethionamide includes M. tuberculosis, M. bovis and M. smegmatis. It also is used rarely against infections with M. leprae and other nontuberculous mycobacteria such as M. avium and M. kansasii. While working in a similar manner to isoniazid, cross resistance is only seen in 13% of strains, since they are both prodrugs but activated by different pathways. Resistance can emerge from mutations in ethA, which is needed to activate the drug, or ethR, which can be overexpressed to repress ethA. Mutations in inhA or the promoter of inhA can also lead to resistance through changing the binding site or overexpression. The FDA has placed it in pregnancy category C, because it has caused birth defects in animal studies. It is not known whether ethionamide is excreted into breast milk. == Adverse effects == Ethionamide frequently causes gastrointestinal distress with nausea and vomiting which can lead patients to stop taking it. This can sometimes be improved by taking it with food. Ethionamide can cause hepatocellular toxicity and is contraindicated in patients with severe liver impairment. Patients on ethionamide should have regular monitoring of their liver function tests. Liver toxicity occurs in up to 5% of patients and follows a pattern similar to isoniazid, usually arising in the first 1 to 3 months of therapy, but can occur even after more than 6 months of therapy. The pattern of liver function test derangement is often a rise in the ALT and AST. Both central neurological side effects such as psychiatric disturbances and encephalopathy, along with peripheral neuropathy have been reported. Administering pyridoxine along with ethionamide may reduce these effects and is recommended. Ethionamide is structurally similar to methimazole, which is used to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis, and has been linked to hypothyroidism in several TB patients. Periodic monitoring of thyroid function while on ethionamide is recommended. === Interactions === Ethionamide may worsen the adverse effects of other antituberculous drugs being taken at the same time. It boosts levels of isoniazid when taken together and can lead to increased rates of peripheral neuropathy and hepatotoxicity. When taken with cycloserine, seizures have been reported. High rates of hepatotoxicty have been reported when taken with rifampicin. The drug's labeling cautions against excessive alcohol ingestion as it may provoke a psychotic reaction. == Mechanism of action == Ethionamide is a prodrug which is activated by the enzyme ethA, a mono-oxygenase in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and then binds NAD+ to form an adduct which inhibits InhA in the same way as isoniazid. The mechanism of action is thought to be through disruption of mycolic acid. Expression of the ethA gene is controlled by ethR, a transcriptional repressor. It is thought that improving ethA expression will increase the efficacy of ethionamide and prompting interest by drug developers in EthR inhibitors as a co-drug. == Other names == 1314 2-ethylisothionicotinamide amidazine thioamide iridocin It is sold under the brand name Trecator by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals which was purchased by Pfizer in 2009. == References == == External links == \"Ethionamide\".

         "Tetrahydropalmatine (THP) is an isoquinoline alkaloid found in several different plant species, mainly in the genus Corydalis (Yan Hu Suo), but also in other plants such as Stephania rotunda. These plants have traditional uses in Chinese herbal medicine. The pharmaceutical industry has synthetically produced the more potent enantiomer Levo-tetrahydropalmatine (Levo-THP; technically l-THP, often written L-THP), which has been marketed worldwide under different brand names as an alternative to anxiolytic and sedative drugs of the benzodiazepine group and analgesics such as opiates. It is also sold as a dietary supplement. In 1940, a Vietnamese scientist Sang Dinh Bui extracted an alkaloid from the root of Stephania rotunda with the yield of 1.2–1.5% and he named this compound rotundin. From 1950 to 1952, two Indian scientists studied and extracted from Stephania glabra another alkaloid named hyndanrine. In 1965, the structure of rotundine and hyndarin was proved to be the same as tetrahydropalmatine. == Effects == Tetrahydropalmatine has been demonstrated to possess analgesic effects and may be beneficial in the treatment of heart disease and liver damage. It is a blocker of voltage-activated L-type calcium channel active potassium channels. It is a potent muscle relaxant. It is widely used in China as a sedative. It has also shown potential in the treatment of drug addiction to both cocaine and opiates, and preliminary human studies have shown promising results. In animal models, anti-addiction effects can manifest at sub-sedative doses. == Adverse effects == In November 2013, the Chinese National Medical Products Administration issued an order asking for all medications containing l-THP to have their package inserts revised, prohibiting use in pregnant women and those with extrapyramidal disorders, requiring warnings about liver impairement and operation of machinery, and highlighting risks of drowsiness and extrapyramidal symptoms with overuse or when combined with other CNS depressants. Long-term is not advised. The same order lists the following OTC medications as containing l-THP: == Mechanism of action == The pharmacological profile of l-THP includes antagonism of dopamine D1, and D2 receptors as well as actions at dopamine D3, alpha adrenergic and serotonin receptors. The Ki values for l-THP at D1 and D2 dopamine receptors are approximately 124 nM (D1) and 388 nM (D2). In addition to the antagonism of post-synaptic dopamine receptors, the blockade of pre-synaptic autoreceptors by l-THP results in increased dopamine release, and it has been suggested that lower affinity of l-THP for D2 receptors may confer some degree of autoreceptor selectivity. Along with dopamine receptors, l-THP has been reported to interact with a number of other receptor types, including alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, at which it functions as an antagonist, and GABA-A receptors, through positive allosteric modulation. Additionally, l-THP displays significant binding to 5-HT1A and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. In the case of 5-HT1A receptors, l-THP binds with a Ki of approximately 340 nM. Animal experiments have shown that the sedative effect of THP results from blocking dopaminergic neurons in the brain. Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system where it occurs in several important signaling systems that regulate muscular activity and attention, as well as feelings of joy, enthusiasm, and creativity. Therefore, THP causes no feelings of euphoria, and has been seen as an alternative to addictive drugs for people suffering from anxiety and pain, and as a possibility for relief for people not helped by existing drugs. == Cases of poisoning == Several cases of poisoning related to THP have been reported. These cases involved bradycardia, respiratory depression, and CNS depression. Some cases report hepatitis, acute and chronic. Fatalities started to be reported in 1999 in cases where an overdose of THP had been used in combination with other drugs having analgesic and anti-anxiety effects. All 1999 deaths could be tied to a single THP-based supplement, sold under the name \"Jin Bu Huan Anodyne Tablets\". Toxicity has been reported in children when taken alone. This product was therefore blacklisted by US and European health authorities. In some other countries, such as Singapore, THP is treated as a controlled substance, and license is required to sell it. In addition, chronic hepatitis has been reported, caused by THP production in East Asia under conditions that were insufficiently sterile. == Research == The University of Maryland has completed a phase I study for THP in people with a history of cocaine use. Their phase II study for cocaine use disorder was withdrawn due to a lack of funding. l-THP does not improve psychiatric symptoms when added on top of antipsychotics in schizophrenia. == See also == == References == == External links == Introduction to Rotundine ZINC entry",

         "Ethambutol (EMB, E) is a medication primarily used to treat tuberculosis. It is usually given in combination with other tuberculosis medications, such as isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide. It may also be used to treat Mycobacterium avium complex, and Mycobacterium kansasii. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include problems with vision, joint pain, nausea, headaches, and feeling tired. Other side effects include liver problems and allergic reactions. It is not recommended in people with optic neuritis, significant kidney problems, or under the age of five. Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding has not been found to cause harm. In the United States the FDA has raised concerns about eye issues in the baby if used during pregnancy. Ethambutol is believed to work by interfering with the bacteria's metabolism. Ethambutol was discovered in 1961. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines and is available as a generic medication. == Chirality and biological activity == (S,S)-(+)-Ethambutol is powerful and selective antitubercular drug. It is a typical example of an old drug that was introduced for clinical use in its unichiral form. Ethambutol contains two constitutionally symmetrical chiral centers in its structure and exists in three stereoisomeric forms, the enantiomeric pair (+)-(S,S)- and (−)-(R,R)-ethambutol, along with the achiral stereoisomer called meso-form. The (+)-(S,S)-enantiomer harbors the antitubercular activity. This enantiomer is 500 and 12 fold more potent than (−)-(R,R)-ethambutol and the meso-form respectively. On the other hand, all the three isomers are equipotent in terms of the major side-effect of the drug, optic neuritis. Toxicity is associated to both dose and duration of treatment. Hence the use of (S,S)-enantiomer greatly improved the risk/benefit balance. == Medical uses == Ethambutol is used along with other medications to treat a number of infections including: tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium complex, and Mycobacterium kansasii. == Adverse effects == Optic neuritis (hence contraindicated in children below six years of age) Red–green color blindness People taking ethambutol should be monitored for changes in visual acuity and color discrimination. Arthralgia Hyperuricaemia Vertical nystagmus Skin rash == Mechanism of action == Ethambutol is bacteriostatic against actively growing TB bacilli. It works by obstructing the formation of cell wall. Mycolic acids attach to the 5'-hydroxyl groups of D-arabinose residues of arabinogalactan and form mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex in the cell wall. It disrupts arabinogalactan synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme arabinosyl transferase. Disruption of the arabinogalactan synthesis inhibits the formation of this complex and leads to increased permeability of the cell wall. == Pharmacokinetics == It is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and well distributed in body tissues and fluids. 50% is excreted unchanged in urine. == References ==",

         "Acamprosate, sold under the brand name Campral, is a medication which reduces alcoholism cravings. It is thought to stabilize chemical signaling in the brain that would otherwise be disrupted by alcohol withdrawal. When used alone, acamprosate is not an effective therapy for alcohol use disorder in most individuals, as it only addresses withdrawal symptoms and not psychological dependence. Acamprosate is a medication that works in the brain to treat alcohol use disorder. Acamprosate works by decreasing cravings and urges to use alcohol. This allows people who take the medication to control urges to drink and help to continue to not use alcohol. Acamprosate does not help with symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. It facilitates a reduction in alcohol consumption as well as full abstinence when used in combination with psychosocial support or other drugs that address the addictive behavior. Serious side effects include allergic reactions, abnormal heart rhythms, and low or high blood pressure, while less serious side effects include headaches, insomnia, and impotence. Diarrhea is the most common side-effect. It is unclear if use is safe during pregnancy. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Acamprosate is useful when used along with counseling in the treatment of alcohol use disorder. Over three to twelve months it increases the number of people who do not drink at all and the number of days without alcohol. It appears to work as well as naltrexone for maintenance of abstinence from alcohol, however naltrexone works slightly better for reducing alcohol cravings and heavy drinking, and acamprosate tends to work more poorly outside of Europe where treatment services are less robust. Difference in severity may also play a role. === Compliance === Some struggle to take the full course of medication (2 tablets, 3 times a day), which makes acamprosate less effective. Standard support to help people take their medication involves monthly check-ins with addiction services or a GP. Research found that compared to standard support alone, extra telephone support by a pharmacist, plus financial incentives, increased the numbers who took medication as prescribed and was cost-effective. The same telephone support without financial incentives did not significantly increase the numbers taking their medication as prescribed and was less cost-effective. == Contraindications == Acamprosate is primarily removed by the kidneys. A dose reduction is suggested in those with moderately impaired kidneys (creatinine clearance between 30 mL/min and 50 mL/min). It is also contraindicated in those who have a strong allergic reaction to acamprosate calcium or any of its components. == Adverse effects == The US label carries warnings about increases in suicidal behavior, major depressive disorder, and kidney failure. Adverse effects that caused people to stop taking the drug in clinical trials included diarrhea, nausea, depression, and anxiety. Potential adverse effects include headache, stomach pain, back pain, muscle pain, joint pain, chest pain, infections, flu-like symptoms, chills, heart palpitations, high blood pressure, fainting, vomiting, upset stomach, constipation, increased appetite, weight gain, edema, sleepiness, decreased sex drive, impotence, forgetfulness, abnormal thinking, abnormal vision, distorted sense of taste, tremors, runny nose, coughing, difficulty breathing, sore throat, bronchitis, and rashes. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === The pharmacodynamics of acamprosate are complex and not fully understood. Ethanol and benzodiazepines act on the central nervous system by binding to the GABAA receptor, increasing the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (i.e., they act as positive allosteric modulators at these receptors). In alcohol use disorder, one of the main mechanisms of tolerance is attributed to GABAA receptors becoming downregulated (i.e. these receptors become less sensitive to GABA). When alcohol is no longer consumed, these down-regulated GABAA receptor complexes are so insensitive to GABA that the typical amount of GABA produced has little effect, leading to physical withdrawal symptoms; since GABA normally inhibits neural firing, GABAA receptor desensitization results in unopposed excitatory neurotransmission (i.e., fewer inhibitory postsynaptic potentials occur through GABAA receptors), leading to neuronal over-excitation (i.e., more action potentials in the postsynaptic neuron). In addition, alcohol also inhibits the activity of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Chronic alcohol consumption leads to the overproduction (upregulation) of these receptors. Thereafter, sudden alcohol abstinence causes the excessive numbers of NMDARs to be more active than normal and to contribute to the symptoms of delirium tremens and excitotoxic neuronal death. Withdrawal from alcohol induces a surge in release of excitatory neurotransmitters like glutamate, which activates NMDARs. Acamprosate reduces this glutamate surge. The drug also protects cultured cells from excitotoxicity induced by ethanol withdrawal and from glutamate exposure combined with ethanol withdrawal. Although its ability to correct an overabundance of glutamate is well-established, the actual molecular target behind this action is poorly known. Knowledge on this topic has seen several major revisions. ==== GABA/NMDA hypothesis ==== It is originally believed to act as an NMDA receptor antagonist and positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors. Its activity on those receptors is indirect, unlike that of most other agents used in this context. An inhibition of the GABA-B system is believed to cause indirect enhancement of GABAA receptors. The effects on the NMDA complex are dose-dependent; the product appears to enhance receptor activation at low concentrations, while inhibiting it when consumed in higher amounts, which counters the excessive activation of NMDA receptors in the context of alcohol withdrawal. At high concentrations, well above those that occur clinically (1 μM to 3 μM), reports of inhibition of glutamate receptor-activated responses (1 mM), enhancement of NMDA receptor function (300 μM), weak antagonization of the NMDA receptor, and partial agonism of the polyamine site of the NMDA receptor. However, no direct action of acamprosate at clinically relevant concentrations has yet been reported. At clinical levels, any inhibiton of the NMDA receptor probably occurs in a allosteric way. One of acamprosate's purported mechanisms of action is the enhancement of GABA signaling at GABAA receptors via positive allosteric receptor modulation. It has been purported to open the chloride ion channel in a novel way as it does not require GABA as a cofactor, making it less liable for dependence than benzodiazepines. Acamprosate has been successfully used to control tinnitus, hyperacusis, ear pain, and inner ear pressure during alcohol use due to spasms of the tensor tympani muscle. ==== mGluR hypothesis ==== Two later hypothesized targets are mGluR1 and mGluR5 (10 μM). The idea originated from the fact that acamprosate blocked the neurotoxicity of an agonist of mGluR1 and mGluR5. However, a subsequent study found no action of acamprosate on the mGluR1 or mGluR5 at concentrations as high as 100 μM, nor at GABAA or glycine receptors or voltage-gated sodium channels. In addition, even if the 10 μM figure is correct, it would still be clinically irrelevant. ==== Calcium hypothesis ==== Spanagel et al. (2014) show that the effects of acamprosate calcium can mostly be attributed to the calcium component. Replacing calcium with sodium produces an inactive drug. Calcium chloride has a similar effect on glutamate neurotransmission. Moreover, calcium carbonate has a similar craving-reducing effect on human alcoholics. ==== Synergy hypothesis ==== Ademar et al. (2023) report that acamprosate sodium does, in fact, enhance the effect of calcium chloride in an animal alcoholism model, and hence is not a fully inactive molecule. They also show a role of increased dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbe downstream of the glycine receptor, partly mimicking ethanol. ==== Other effects ==== The product also increases the endogenous production of taurine. The substance also helps re-establish a standard sleep architecture by normalizing stage 3 and REM sleep phases, which is believed to be an important aspect of its pharmacological activity. === Pharmacokinetics === Acamprosate is not metabolized by the human body. Acamprosate's absolute bioavailability from oral administration is approximately 11%, and its bioavailability is decreased when taken with food. Following administration and absorption of acamprosate, it is excreted unchanged (i.e., as acamprosate) via the kidneys. Co-administration with naltrexone increases plasma levels. Its absorption and elimination are very slow, with a tmax of 6 hours and an elimination half life of over 30 hours. Steady-state levels are reached by day 5 of oral treatment. == History == Acamprosate was developed by Lipha, a subsidiary of Merck KGaA. and was approved for marketing in Europe in 1989. In October 2001 Forest Laboratories acquired the rights to market the drug in the US. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 2004. The first generic versions of acamprosate were launched in the US in 2013. As of 2015, acamprosate was in development by Confluence Pharmaceuticals as a potential treatment for fragile X syndrome. The drug was granted orphan drug designation for this use by the FDA in 2013, and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2014. == Society and culture == === Names === Acamprosate is the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) and the British Approved Name (BAN). Acamprosate calcium is the United States Adopted Name (USAN) and the Japanese Accepted Name (JAN). It is also technically known as N-acetylhomotaurine or as calcium acetylhomotaurinate. It is sold under the brand name Campral. == Research == In addition to its apparent ability to help people refrain from drinking, some evidence suggests that acamprosate is neuroprotective (that is, it protects neurons from damage and death caused by the effects of alcohol withdrawal, and possibly other causes of neurotoxicity). It has been tried for autism, both ideopathic and fragile X syndrome-linked. It appears to reduce amyloid-beta precursor protein levels. == References ==",

         " Pegylated recombinant human hyaluronidase (PEGPH20) degrades hyaluronan (HA) and, in combination with chemotherapy, prolongs survival in preclinical models. The activity of PEGPH20 with modified fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFIRINOX) was evaluated in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (mPC). Patients had untreated mPC, a performance status of 0 to 1, and adequate organ function. Tumor HA status was not required for eligibility. After a phase Ib dose-finding study of mFOLFIRINOX plus PEGPH20, the phase II open-label study randomly assigned patients (1:1) to the combination arm or to mFOLFIRINOX alone (n = 138). The primary end point was overall survival (OS). PEGPH20 dosages of 3 µg/kg every 2 weeks were more tolerable than twice-weekly dosages used in the phase I study, so 3 µg/kg every 2 weeks was the phase II dosage. An amendment instituted enoxaparin prophylaxis in the PEGPH20 combination arm as a result of increased thromboembolic (TE) events. The planned interim futility analysis when 35 deaths (of 103 analyzable patients) occurred resulted in an OS hazard ratio (HR) of 2.07 that favored the control arm, and the study was closed to accrual. The treatment-related grade 3 to 4 toxicity was significantly increased in the PEGPH20 combination arm relative to control (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1 to 7.1). The median OS in the mFOLFIRINOX arm was 14.4 months (95% CI, 10.1 to 15.7 months) versus 7.7 months (95% CI, 4.6 to 9.3 months) in the PEGPH20 combination arm. Addition of PEGPH20 to mFOLFIRINOX seems to be detrimental in patients unselected for tumor HA status. This combination caused increased toxicity (mostly GI and TE events) and resulted in decreased treatment duration compared with mFOLFIRINOX alone. The median OS in the mFOLFIRINOX control arm (14.4 months) is, to our knowledge, the longest yet reported and can be considered for patients with good PS. Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading viral cause of lower respiratory tract disease in infants and children worldwide. In previous work to develop point mutations in RSV with improved genetic stability, we observed that an attenuating mutation at amino acid position 1321 in the L polymerase protein was subject to deattenuation by a spontaneous second-site compensatory mutation at position 1313 (C. Luongo, C. C. Winter, P. L. Collins, and U. J. Buchholz, J. Virol. 86:10792-10804, 2012). In the present study, we found that deletion of position 1313 (Δ1313), irrespective of the presence of an attenuating mutation at position 1321, provided a new attenuating mutation. RSV bearing Δ1313 replicated in cell culture as efficiently as wild-type virus at 32°C, was restricted for replication at 37°C, and was restricted 50-fold and 150-fold in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, respectively, of mice. We combined the Δ1313 deletion with the previously described, attenuating NS2 gene deletion (ΔNS2) to produce the recombinant live-attenuated RSV vaccine candidate ΔNS2/Δ1313. During in vitro stress tests involving serial passage at incrementally increasing temperatures, a second-site compensatory mutation was detected in close proximity of Δ1313, namely, I1314T. This site was genetically and phenotypically stabilized by an I1314L substitution. Combination of I1314L with ΔNS2/Δ1313 yielded a virus, ΔNS2/Δ1313/1314L, with genetic stability at physiological temperature. This stabilized vaccine candidate was moderately temperature sensitive and had a level of restriction in chimpanzees comparable to that of MEDI-559, a promising RSV vaccine candidate that presently is in clinical trials but lacks stabilized attenuating mutations. The level of attenuation and genetic stability identify ΔNS2/Δ1313/1314L as a promising candidate for evaluation in pediatric phase I studies.",

         "Food, Medical, Personal Care",
         "Aloin, also known as barbaloin, is a bitter, yellow-brown colored compound noted in the exudate of at least 68 Aloe species at levels from 0.1 to 6.6% of leaf dry weight (making between 3% and 35% of the total exudate), and in another 17 species at indeterminate levels [Reynolds, 1995b]. It is used as a stimulant-laxative, treating constipation by inducing bowel movements. The compound is present in what is commonly referred to as the aloe latex that exudes from cells adjacent to the vascular bundles, found under the rind of the leaf and in between it and the gel. When dried, it has been used as a bittering agent in commerce (alcoholic beverages) [21 CFR 172.510. Scientific names given include Aloe perryi, A. barbadensis (= A. vera), A. ferox, and hybrids of A. ferox with A. africana and A. spicata.]. Aloe is listed in federal regulations as a natural substance that may be \"safely used in food\" when used \"in the minimum quantity required to produce their intended physical or technical effect and in accordance with all the principles of good manufacturing practice.\" This food application is generally limited to use in quite small quantities as a flavoring in alcoholic beverages and may usually be identified only as a \"natural flavor.\" In May 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a ruling that aloe laxatives are no longer generally recognized as safe (GRAS) and effective, meaning that aloin-containing products are no longer available in over-the-counter drug products in the United States, because they may be carcinogenic and more data is needed to establish otherwise. Aloe vera leaf latex is a concentrate of an herb or other botanical, and so meets the statutory description of an ingredient that may be used in dietary supplements. == Structure and preparation == Aloin extracted from natural sources is a mixture of two diastereomers, termed aloin A (also called barbaloin) and aloin B (or isobarbaloin), which have similar chemical properties. Aloin is an anthraquinone glycosyl, meaning that its anthraquinone skeleton has been modified by the addition of a sugar molecule. Anthraquinones are a common family of naturally occurring yellow, orange, and red pigments of which many have cathartic properties, attributes shared by aloin. Aloin is related to aloe emodin, which lacks a sugar group but shares aloin's biological properties. Aloin is usually prepared by extraction from aloe latex (the term \"Cape aloe\" also refers to the dried latex of the leaves of several species of the genus Aloe, especially A. ferox [Blumenthal, 1998]), the bitter yellow exudate that seeps out from just underneath the skin of aloe leaves. The latex is then dried and powdered to make the final product, often made into tablets or a beverage, though aloin does not have good stability in aqueous solutions. Products derived from the gel of the aloe plant do not contain appreciable amounts of aloin, and have not been proven effective for any disease or condition when taken orally. == Effects == Once ingested, aloin increases peristaltic contractions in the colon, which induces bowel movements. Aloin also prevents the colon from re-absorbing water from the gastrointestinal tract, which leads to softer stools. This effect is caused by aloin's opening of chloride channels of the colonic membrane. In higher doses, these effects may lead to electrolyte imbalance, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, which are common side-effects of the drug. Because aloin can potentially cause uterine contractions, pregnant women should avoid ingesting aloe products containing aloin in more than trace amounts. In a study on consumption of aloe in rats and tilapia (with no separation of gel from aloin), significant negative health effects were found, including normocytic normochromic anaemia (low red blood cell count, but normal cells), hypoproteinaemia, and high AST levels. As many studies involving aloe gel (without aloin) have not observed these negative effects, it is possible that the negative effects could in large part be due to aloin. == Legal status == Plant-derived remedies containing aloin and other anthraquinones have been used as traditional medicines since antiquity, but harsh side effects make aloin generally unsuitable for household or daily use. In 2002, the US FDA mandated that manufacturers reformulate or stop manufacturing over-the-counter products containing aloe because the agency did not receive necessary safety data. The substance is still allowed in dietary supplements [21 U.S.C. 321 (ff)(1)] and is allowed for use in foods (primarily alcoholic beverages). == References == == External links == Aloin MSDS",

         "Aloin, also known as barbaloin, is a bitter, yellow-brown colored compound noted in the exudate of at least 68 Aloe species at levels from 0.1 to 6.6% of leaf dry weight (making between 3% and 35% of the total exudate), and in another 17 species at indeterminate levels [Reynolds, 1995b]. It is used as a stimulant-laxative, treating constipation by inducing bowel movements. The compound is present in what is commonly referred to as the aloe latex that exudes from cells adjacent to the vascular bundles, found under the rind of the leaf and in between it and the gel. When dried, it has been used as a bittering agent in commerce (alcoholic beverages) [21 CFR 172.510. Scientific names given include Aloe perryi, A. barbadensis (= A. vera), A. ferox, and hybrids of A. ferox with A. africana and A. spicata.]. Aloe is listed in federal regulations as a natural substance that may be \"safely used in food\" when used \"in the minimum quantity required to produce their intended physical or technical effect and in accordance with all the principles of good manufacturing practice.\" This food application is generally limited to use in quite small quantities as a flavoring in alcoholic beverages and may usually be identified only as a \"natural flavor.\" In May 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a ruling that aloe laxatives are no longer generally recognized as safe (GRAS) and effective, meaning that aloin-containing products are no longer available in over-the-counter drug products in the United States, because they may be carcinogenic and more data is needed to establish otherwise. Aloe vera leaf latex is a concentrate of an herb or other botanical, and so meets the statutory description of an ingredient that may be used in dietary supplements. == Structure and preparation == Aloin extracted from natural sources is a mixture of two diastereomers, termed aloin A (also called barbaloin) and aloin B (or isobarbaloin), which have similar chemical properties. Aloin is an anthraquinone glycosyl, meaning that its anthraquinone skeleton has been modified by the addition of a sugar molecule. Anthraquinones are a common family of naturally occurring yellow, orange, and red pigments of which many have cathartic properties, attributes shared by aloin. Aloin is related to aloe emodin, which lacks a sugar group but shares aloin's biological properties. Aloin is usually prepared by extraction from aloe latex (the term \"Cape aloe\" also refers to the dried latex of the leaves of several species of the genus Aloe, especially A. ferox [Blumenthal, 1998]), the bitter yellow exudate that seeps out from just underneath the skin of aloe leaves. The latex is then dried and powdered to make the final product, often made into tablets or a beverage, though aloin does not have good stability in aqueous solutions. Products derived from the gel of the aloe plant do not contain appreciable amounts of aloin, and have not been proven effective for any disease or condition when taken orally. == Effects == Once ingested, aloin increases peristaltic contractions in the colon, which induces bowel movements. Aloin also prevents the colon from re-absorbing water from the gastrointestinal tract, which leads to softer stools. This effect is caused by aloin's opening of chloride channels of the colonic membrane. In higher doses, these effects may lead to electrolyte imbalance, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, which are common side-effects of the drug. Because aloin can potentially cause uterine contractions, pregnant women should avoid ingesting aloe products containing aloin in more than trace amounts. In a study on consumption of aloe in rats and tilapia (with no separation of gel from aloin), significant negative health effects were found, including normocytic normochromic anaemia (low red blood cell count, but normal cells), hypoproteinaemia, and high AST levels. As many studies involving aloe gel (without aloin) have not observed these negative effects, it is possible that the negative effects could in large part be due to aloin. == Legal status == Plant-derived remedies containing aloin and other anthraquinones have been used as traditional medicines since antiquity, but harsh side effects make aloin generally unsuitable for household or daily use. In 2002, the US FDA mandated that manufacturers reformulate or stop manufacturing over-the-counter products containing aloe because the agency did not receive necessary safety data. The substance is still allowed in dietary supplements [21 U.S.C. 321 (ff)(1)] and is allowed for use in foods (primarily alcoholic beverages). == References == == External links == Aloin MSDS",

         " Esophageal cancer (EC) is a common malignant tumor of the digestive system. Exploring the molecular biological mechanism of EC will help to clarify its carcinogenesis mechanism, find important molecular targets in the process of carcinogenesis, and provide new ideas for the diagnosis and treatment of EC. Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway is one of the signal transduction pathways most closely related to cell proliferation and apoptosis. The regulation of various downstream molecules affects the proliferation and growth of tumor cells. In this study, we determined the effect of different concentrations of afuresertib on cell viability by MTT assay and determined the effect of afuresertib on cell apoptosis by Annexin V-FITC/PI dual staining. Animal experiments verified the effects of afuresertib on VEGF, bFGF, and PI3K/Akt. Our results indicated that afuresertib is closely related to the survival, proliferation, and apoptosis of esophageal cancer cell lines. More importantly, we found that afuresertib could reduce tumor volume and mass in EC rats through in vivo experiments. In conclusion, afuresertib may exert its antitumor effect by inhibiting the expression of PI3K and Akt-related proteins in rat tumor tissues. Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a highly aggressive neuroendocrine neoplasm of the skin, which has an exceedingly poor prognosis. The AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway, which plays a pivotal role in the modulation of protein synthesis and cell survival, has been shown to be extremely important for Merkel cell carcinogenesis. In the current study, we found that AKT has important regulatory functions in MCC cells and that inhibition of AKT with the novel ATP-competitive AKT inhibitor, afuresertib, has widespread effects on proliferative pathways. In particular, we found that treatment of MCC cells with afuresertib led to deactivation of mTOR and glycogen synthase kinase 3 pathway proteins while increasing activation of proapoptotic pathways through the upregulation of p16 expression and phosphomodulation of the B-cell lymphoma-2-associated death promoter. Overall, afuresertib treatment led to significant and robust inhibition of MCC cell proliferation, thus raising intriguing questions regarding the potential efficacy of AKT inhibition for the future clinical management of MCC. Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), an asbestos-related occupational disease, is an aggressive and incurable tumor of the thoracic cavity. Despite recent advances in MPM treatment, overall survival of patients with MPM is very low. Recent studies have implicated that PI3K/Akt signaling is involved in MPM cell survival and development. To investigate the effects of Akt inhibitors on MPM cell survival, we examined the effects of nine selective Akt inhibitors, namely, afuresertib, Akti-1/2, AZD5363, GSK690693, ipatasertib, MK-2206, perifosine, PHT-427, and TIC10, on six MPM cell lines, namely, ACC-MESO-4, Y-MESO-8A, MSTO-211H, NCI-H28, NCI-H290, and NCI-H2052, and a normal mesothelial cell line MeT-5A.

It is the dilactone of hexahydroxydiphenic acid. == Name == The name comes from the French term acide ellagique, from the word galle spelled backward because it can be obtained from noix de galle (galls), and to distinguish it from acide gallique (gallic acid). The molecule structure resembles to that of two gallic acid molecules being assembled \"head to tail\" and bound together by a C–C bond (as in biphenyl, or in diphenic acid) and two lactone links (cyclic carboxylic esters). == Metabolism == === Biosynthesis === Plants produce ellagic acid from hydrolysis of tannins such as ellagitannin and geraniin. === Biodegradation === Urolithins are gut flora human metabolites of dietary ellagic acid derivatives. Ellagic acid has low bioavailability, with 90% remaining unabsorbed from the intestines until metabolized by microflora to the more bioavailable urolithins. == History == Ellagic acid was first discovered by chemist Henri Braconnot in 1831. Maximilian Nierenstein prepared this substance from algarobilla, dividivi, oak bark, pomegranate, myrabolams, and valonea in 1905. He also suggested its formation from galloyl-glycine by Penicillium in 1915. Julius Löwe was the first person to synthesize ellagic acid by heating gallic acid with arsenic acid or silver oxide. == Natural occurrences == Ellagic acid is found in edible nuts. It is also found in oak species such as the North American white oak (Quercus alba) and European red oak (Quercus robur). The macrophyte Myriophyllum spicatum produces ellagic acid. Ellagic acid can be found in the medicinal mushroom Phellinus linteus. === In food === The highest levels of ellagic acid are found in raw chestnuts, walnuts, pecans, cranberries, raspberries, strawberries, and grapes, as well as distilled beverages. It is also found in peaches and pomegranates. == Research and health claims == Ellagic acid has been marketed as a dietary supplement with various claimed benefits against cancer, heart disease, and other diseases. In the 21st century, numerous U.S.-based supplement companies received FDA warning letters for promoting ellagic acid with false anti-disease claims that violate the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.

         " Dynogen Pharmaceuticals Inc, under license from Mitsubishi Pharma Corp, is developing pumosetrag (MKC-733, DDP-733), an orally available gastroprokinetic agent and locally acting 5-HT3 partial agonist, for the potential treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with constipation and nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In September 2005, Dynogen commenced a phase II proof-of-concept trial of pumosetrag in IBS with constipation; positive results were reported in February 2007 and a phase IIb trial was to start in the fourth quarter of 2007. In September 2006, the company had initiated a phase Ib trial in nocturnal GERD. Low basal lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure and transient LES relaxations are major causes of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Pumosetrag, a novel selective partial 5HT3 receptor agonist, showed a promising effect on reducing reflux events in health. We aimed to evaluate the effect of pumosetrag on changes in reflux episodes, lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP), and specific symptoms in patients with GERD receiving a refluxogenic meal. Patients with GERD, who developed heartburn and/or regurgitation after ingestion of a refluxogenic meal, were randomized to 1 of 3 dose levels of pumosetrag (0.2, 0.5, or 0.8 mg) or placebo. Before and after 7 days of treatment, patients underwent manometry, intraesophageal multichannel, intraluminal impedance and pH after a standard refluxogenic meal. A total of 223 patients with GERD [125 (56%) women, mean (SD) age = 36 (12) years] were enrolled. No overall treatment effects were detected for the total number of reflux episodes (acidic and weakly acidic) (p > 0.5); however, significant treatment effects (p < 0.05) on the number of acid reflux episodes were observed with lower values on pumosetrag 0.2 mg (10.8 ± 1.1), 0.5 mg (9.5 ± 1.1), and 0.8 mg (9.9 ± 1.1) compared with placebo (13.3 ± 1.1). Significant treatment effects (p < 0.05) were also observed for the percentage of time pH was <4, with less time for pumosetrag at 0.5 mg (10%) and 0.8 mg (10%) compared with placebo (16%). In GERD, the partial 5HT3 agonist pumosetrag significantly reduced the rate of acid reflux events but did not result in a significant change in LESP or symptomatic improvement over a 1-week treatment period.",

         "Medical",
         "Cefditoren, also known as cefditoren pivoxil is an antibiotic used to treat infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria that are resistant to other antibiotics. It is mainly used for treatment of community acquired pneumonia. It is taken by mouth and is in the cephalosporin family of antibiotics, which is part of the broader beta-lactam group of antibiotics. == Structure == Like other cephalosporins, cefditoren has a β-lactam ring at the 7 position of cephalosporin ring that is responsible for its inhibitory action on bacterial cell wall synthesis. In addition to the cephem nucleus common to all cephalosporins, cefditoren has an aminothiazole group that enhances its activity against Gram-negative organisms, a methylthiazole group that enhances its activity against Gram-positive organisms, a methoxyimino group that gives it stability against β-lactamases, and a pivoxil ester group that enhances oral bioavailability. == Antimicrobial activity == The spectrum of cefditoren includes both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species. It has strong antimicrobial activity because of its high affinity for penicillin binding protein 2X, which responsible for cephalosporin resistance when mutated. Cefditoren pivoxil high intrinsic activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-resistant strains. Cefditoren holds a balanced antimicrobial spectrum that includes the three major pathogens of community-acquired lower-respiratory tract infections: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis. Aerobic Gram-positive microorganisms: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible strains, including β-lactamase-producing strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes Aerobic Gram-negative microorganisms: Haemophilus influenzae (including β-lactamase-producing strains), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (including β-lactamase-producing strains), Moraxella catarrhalis (including β-lactamase-producing strains. == Pharmacokinetics == === Absorption === Oral bioavailability: following oral administration, cefditoren pivoxil is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and hydrolyzed to cefditoren by esterases. Maximal plasma concentrations of cefditoren under fasting conditions average 1.8 ± 0.6 μg/mL following 200 mg dose and occur 1.5 to 3 hours following dosing. Cefditoren does not accumulate in plasma following twice daily administration to subjects with normal renal function. Under fasting conditions, the estimated absolute bioavailability of cefditoren pivoxil is approximately 14%. === Distribution === Binding of cefditoren to plasma proteins averages 88%, and the mean volume of distribution of cefditoren at steady state is 9.3L. Cefditoren has been shown to penetrate into bronchial mucosa, epithelial lining fluid, skin blister fluid and tonsillar tissue and clinically relevant concentrations against common pathogens are achieved in these tissues for at least 4 hours. === Metabolism and Excretion === Cefditoren is predominantly eliminated by the kidneys as unchanged drug and has a renal clearance of 4.1–5.6 L/h after multiple doses; its elimination half-life is 1.5 hours. == Medical uses == Cefditoren pivoxil is indicated to treat uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections, community-acquired pneumonia, acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, pharyngitis, and tonsillitis, acute maxillary sinusitis, otitis media (indications may differ in some countries). === Spectrum of bacterial susceptibility === Cefditoren pivoxil has a broad spectrum of activity and has been used to treat bacterial infections of the skin and respiratory tract, including bronchitis, pneumonia, and tonsillitis. The following represents minimum inhibitory concentration data for several medically significant microorganisms. Haemophilus influenzae: ≥0.063 – 0.25 μg/ml Staphylcoccus aureus: 0.25 – >128 μg/ml (not including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) Streptococcus pyogenes: ≤0.004 – 2 μg/ml Cefditoren does not have antibacterial activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. == Dosage and administration == === Adults and Adolescents (≥12 Years) === Community-acquired pneumonia: 400 mg twice daily for 14 days Acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis: 400 mg twice daily for 10 days Pharyngitis/tonsillitis, otitis media, sinusitis: 200 mg twice daily for 10 days Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections: 200 mg twice daily for 10 days === Children (2 months to 12 years of age) === Pneumonia, otitis media or sinusitis: 3 mg/kg/dose, 3 times a day, after meals. The dosage may be increased up to 6 mg/kg/dose as needed, but not exceed the maximum dose for adults. For children with diseases other than above: 3 mg/kg/dose, 3 times a day after meals. The dosage may be adjusted according to the disease or the patients age and symptoms, but not exceed the maximum dose for adults. Safety in low birth weight infants and newborns has not been established. == Pregnancy == === Pregnancy Category B === Cefditoren pivoxil was not teratogenic up to the highest doses tested in rats and rabbits. In rats, this dose was 1000 mg/kg/day, which is approximately 24 times a human dose of 200 mg twice daily based on mg/m2/day. In rabbits, the highest dose tested was 90 mg/kg/day, which is approximately four times a human dose of 200 mg twice daily based on mg/m2/day. This dose produced severe maternal toxicity and resulted in fetal toxicity and abortions. In a postnatal development study in rats, cefditoren pivoxil produced no adverse effects on postnatal survival, physical and behavioral development, learning abilities, and reproductive capability at sexual maturity when tested at doses of up to 750 mg/kg/day, the highest dose tested. This is approximately 18 times a human dose of 200 mg twice daily based on mg/m2/day. There are, however, no adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women. Because animal reproductive studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. == Geriatric use == Of the 2675 patients in clinical studies who received cefditoren pivoxil 200 mg twice daily, 308 (12%) were >65 years of age. Of the 2159 patients in clinical studies who received cefditoren pivoxil 400 mg twice daily, 307 (14%) were >65 years of age. No clinically significant differences in effectiveness or safety were observed between older and younger patients. No dose adjustments are necessary in geriatric patients with normal renal function. This drug is substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. == International approvals == Cefditoren pivoxil is available as 200 and 400 mg tablets in the United States. It was marketed under the trade name Spectracef by Vansen Pharma Inc. Cefditoren is also marketed under the name Meiact by Meiji Seika Pharma Co., Ltd. In India it is marketed under the brand name Zostum-O by Zuventus Healthcare. === Proprietary Preparations and Countries === US:Spectracef; India:Zostum-O; Japan:Meiact; Russia:Spectracef; China:Meiact; Greece:Spectracef; Indonesia:Meiact; Italy:Giasion; Mexico:Spectracef; Portugal:Meiact; Thailand:Meiact; Turkey: Cftiten, Meiact; Sefporin Spain: Spectracef, Meiact. == Contraindications == In patients with known allergy to the cephalosporin class of antibiotics or any of its components. Patients with carnitine deficiency or inborn errors of metabolism that may result in clinically significant carnitine deficiency, because use of cefditoren causes renal excretion of carnitine. == Safety and tolerability == Cefditoren pivoxil is generally well-tolerated, with most adverse events being of mild-to-moderate severity and self-limiting. Gastrointestinal adverse events (e.g., diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal pain) were the most commonly reported adverse events, although they seldom led to treatment discontinuation. In a post-marketing surveillance evaluating safety in 2006 children with acute otitis media treated with cefditoren (median daily dose: 10.0 mg/kg with a median total treatment period of 7 days), the incidence of adverse reactions was 1.79%, without unexpected or serious adverse drug reactions reported. The most frequent adverse drug reaction was diarrhea (1.30%) that resolved or subsided during treatment or after discontinuation or completion of therapy in all cases. Data from the clinical studies carried out with cefditoren in the treatment of pharyngotonsillitis from 2007 to 2010 in Japan showed that the percentage of adverse events was very low and diarrhea was the most frequent event. In the largest study (734 children), the incidence of adverse reactions was 1.50% (11 events in 11 patients), with 3 events of diarrhea and three of hematuria in urinalysis without clinical symptoms. In a study carried out in children in Thailand comparing cefditoren (66 patients) with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (72 patients) for 10 days in the treatment of acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, the most frequent adverse event was diarrhea, with significant (P = 0.02) differences in the percentages found for both compounds (4.5% with cefditoren vs. 18.1% for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid). == Guidelines == === Japanese Guidelines === Japanese guidelines for the management of respiratory infectious diseases in children recommend cefditoren pivoxil as an initial antimicrobial therapy in children (2 months and older). === A panel of 70 pulmonologists, coordinated by 9 experts in respiratory care recommendations === A consensus on appropriate prescribing in lower respiratory tract infection therapy was appraised by Delphi exercise, based on a panel of 70 pulmonologists, coordinated by a scientific committee of nine experts in respiratory medical care. Amongst 3rd-generation oral cephalosporins, cefditoren pivoxil has the highest intrinsic activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin-resistant strains included. Amongst 3rd-generation oral cephalosporins, the spectrum of cefditoren is particularly balanced, includes both Gram-positive and Gram-negative species. The experts expressed the opinion that, due to its high intrinsic activity, cefditoren appears as an appropriate agent for either the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections and for parenteral to oral switch therapy as well. == Ideal for switch therapy == The characteristics of oral antibiotics to be considered for the switch therapy (parenteral to oral antibiotic) are: (i) similar antimicrobial spectrum, (ii) high bioavailability, (iii) administration time 12–24 hours, (iv) good tolerability The expert panel reached a high level of consensus on cefditoren pivoxil as the most appropriate option for the switch therapy from parenteral third-generation cephalosporins (like cefotaxime or ceftriaxone) to oral therapy, because of the similar spectrum and the highest intrinsic activity. == References == == External links == Drug Approval Package Manufacturer's Product website Manufacturer's prescribing information for Spectracef",

         "Endogenous, Medical, Personal Care",
         "Lipoic acid (LA), also known as α-lipoic acid, alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) and thioctic acid, is an organosulfur compound derived from caprylic acid (octanoic acid). ALA, which is made in animals normally, is essential for aerobic metabolism. It is also available as a dietary supplement or pharmaceutical drug in some countries. Lipoate is the conjugate base of lipoic acid, and the most prevalent form of LA under physiological conditions. Only the (R)-(+)-enantiomer (RLA) exists in nature. RLA is an essential cofactor of many processes. == Physical and chemical properties == Lipoic acid contains two sulfur atoms connected by a disulfide bond in the 1,2-dithiolane ring. It also carries a carboxylic acid group. It is considered to be oxidized relative to its acyclic relative dihydrolipoic acid, in which each sulfur exists as a thiol. It is a yellow solid. (R)-(+)-lipoic acid (RLA) occurs naturally, but (S)-(-)-lipoic acid (SLA) has been synthesized. For use in dietary supplement materials and compounding pharmacies, the USP established an official monograph for R/S-LA. == Biological function == Lipoic acid is a cofactor for five enzymes or classes of enzymes: pyruvate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, the glycine cleavage system, branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase, and the α-oxo(keto)adipate dehydrogenase. The first two are critical to the citric acid cycle. The GCS regulates glycine concentrations. HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3, HDAC6, HDAC8, and HDAC10 are targets of the reduced form (open dithiol) of (R)-lipoic acid. === Biosynthesis and attachment === Most endogenously produced RLA are not \"free\" because octanoic acid, the precursor to RLA, is bound to the enzyme complexes prior to enzymatic insertion of the sulfur atoms. As a cofactor, RLA is covalently attached by an amide bond to a terminal lysine residue of the enzyme's lipoyl domains. The precursor to lipoic acid, octanoic acid, is made via fatty acid biosynthesis in the form of octanoyl-acyl carrier protein. In eukaryotes, a second fatty acid biosynthetic pathway in mitochondria is used for this purpose. The octanoate is transferred as a thioester of acyl carrier protein from fatty acid biosynthesis to an amide of the lipoyl domain protein by an enzyme called an octanoyltransferase. Two hydrogens of octanoate are replaced with sulfur groups via a radical SAM mechanism, by lipoyl synthase. As a result, lipoic acid is synthesized attached to proteins and no free lipoic acid is produced. Lipoic acid can be removed whenever proteins are degraded and by action of the enzyme lipoamidase. Free lipoate can be used by some organisms as an enzyme called lipoate protein ligase that attaches it covalently to the correct protein. The ligase activity of this enzyme requires ATP. === Cellular transport === Along with sodium and the vitamins biotin (B7) and pantothenic acid (B5), lipoic acid enters cells through the SMVT (sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter). Each of the compounds transported by the SMVT is competitive with the others. For example research has shown that increasing intake of lipoic acid or pantothenic acid reduces the uptake of biotin and/or the activities of biotin-dependent enzymes. === Enzymatic activity === Lipoic acid is a cofactor for at least five enzyme systems. Two of these are in the citric acid cycle through which many organisms turn nutrients into energy. Lipoylated enzymes have lipoic acid attached to them covalently. The lipoyl group transfers acyl groups in 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes, and methylamine group in the glycine cleavage complex or glycine dehydrogenase. Lipoic acid is the cofactor of the following enzymes in humans: The most-studied of these is the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. These complexes have three central subunits: E1-3, which are the decarboxylase, lipoyl transferase, and dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, respectively. These complexes have a central E2 core and the other subunits surround this core to form the complex. In the gap between these two subunits, the lipoyl domain ferries intermediates between the active sites. The lipoyl domain itself is attached by a flexible linker to the E2 core and the number of lipoyl domains varies from one to three for a given organism. The number of domains has been experimentally varied and seems to have little effect on growth until over nine are added, although more than three decreased activity of the complex. Lipoic acid serves as co-factor to the acetoin dehydrogenase complex catalyzing the conversion of acetoin (3-hydroxy-2-butanone) to acetaldehyde and acetyl coenzyme A. The glycine cleavage system differs from the other complexes, and has a different nomenclature. In this system, the H protein is a free lipoyl domain with additional helices, the L protein is a dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase, the P protein is the decarboxylase, and the T protein transfers the methylamine from lipoate to tetrahydrofolate (THF) yielding methylene-THF and ammonia. Methylene-THF is then used by serine hydroxymethyltransferase to synthesize serine from glycine. This system is part of plant photorespiration. === Biological sources and degradation === Lipoic acid is present in many foods in which it is bound to lysine in proteins, but slightly more so in kidney, heart, liver, spinach, broccoli, and yeast extract. Naturally occurring lipoic acid is always covalently bound and not readily available from dietary sources. In addition, the amount of lipoic acid present in dietary sources is low. For instance, the purification of lipoic acid to determine its structure used an estimated 10 tons of liver residue, which yielded 30 mg of lipoic acid. As a result, all lipoic acid available as a supplement is chemically synthesized. Baseline levels (prior to supplementation) of RLA and R-DHLA have not been detected in human plasma. RLA has been detected at 12.3−43.1 ng/mL following acid hydrolysis, which releases protein-bound lipoic acid. Enzymatic hydrolysis of protein bound lipoic acid released 1.4−11.6 ng/mL and <1-38.2 ng/mL using subtilisin and alcalase, respectively. Digestive proteolytic enzymes cleave the R-lipoyllysine residue from the mitochondrial enzyme complexes derived from food but are unable to cleave the lipoic acid-L-lysine amide bond. Both synthetic lipoamide and (R)-lipoyl-L-lysine are rapidly cleaved by serum lipoamidases, which release free (R)-lipoic acid and either L-lysine or ammonia. Little is known about the degradation and utilization of aliphatic sulfides such as lipoic acid, except for cysteine. Lipoic acid is metabolized in a variety of ways when given as a dietary supplement in mammals. Degradation to tetranorlipoic acid, oxidation of one or both of the sulfur atoms to the sulfoxide, and S-methylation of the sulfide were observed. Conjugation of unmodified lipoic acid to glycine was detected especially in mice. Degradation of lipoic acid is similar in humans, although it is not clear if the sulfur atoms become significantly oxidized. Apparently mammals are not capable of utilizing lipoic acid as a sulfur source. == Diseases == === Combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA) === In the metabolic disease combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA) due to ACSF3 deficiency, mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis (mtFASII), which is the precursor reaction of lipoic acid biosynthesis, is impaired. The result is a reduced lipoylation degree of important mitochondrial enzymes, such as pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC) and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (α-KGDHC). Supplementation with lipoic acid does not restore mitochondrial function. == Chemical synthesis == SLA did not exist prior to chemical synthesis in 1952. SLA is produced in equal amounts with RLA during achiral manufacturing processes. The racemic form was more widely used clinically in Europe and Japan in the 1950s to 1960s despite the early recognition that the various forms of LA are not bioequivalent. The first synthetic procedures appeared for RLA and SLA in the mid-1950s. Advances in chiral chemistry led to more efficient technologies for manufacturing the single enantiomers by both classical resolution and asymmetric synthesis and the demand for RLA also grew at this time. In the 21st century, R/S-LA, RLA and SLA with high chemical and/or optical purities are available in industrial quantities. At the current time, most of the world supply of R/S-LA and RLA is manufactured in China and smaller amounts in Italy, Germany, and Japan. RLA is produced by modifications of a process first described by Georg Lang in a Ph.D. thesis and later patented by DeGussa. Although RLA is favored nutritionally due to its \"vitamin-like\" role in metabolism, both RLA and R/S-LA are widely available as dietary supplements. Both stereospecific and non-stereospecific reactions are known to occur in vivo and contribute to the mechanisms of action, but evidence to date indicates RLA may be the eutomer (the nutritionally and therapeutically preferred form). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacokinetics === A 2007 human pharmacokinetic study of sodium RLA demonstrated the maximum concentration in plasma and bioavailability are significantly greater than the free acid form, and rivals plasma levels achieved by intravenous administration of the free acid form. Additionally, high plasma levels comparable to those in animal models where Nrf2 was activated were achieved. The various forms of LA are not bioequivalent. Very few studies compare individual enantiomers with racemic lipoic acid. It is unclear if twice as much racemic lipoic acid can replace RLA. The toxic dose of LA in cats is much lower than that in humans or dogs and produces hepatocellular toxicity. === Pharmacodynamics === The mechanism and action of lipoic acid when supplied externally to an organism is controversial. Lipoic acid in a cell seems primarily to induce the oxidative stress response rather than directly scavenge free radicals. This effect is specific for RLA. Despite the strongly reducing milieu, LA has been detected intracellularly in both oxidized and reduced forms. LA is able to scavenge reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species in a biochemical assay due to long incubation times, but there is little evidence this occurs within a cell or that radical scavenging contributes to the primary mechanisms of action of LA. The relatively good scavenging activity of LA toward hypochlorous acid (a bactericidal produced by neutrophils that may produce inflammation and tissue damage) is due to the strained conformation of the 5-membered dithiolane ring, which is lost upon reduction to DHLA. In cells, LA is reduced to dihydrolipoic acid, which is generally regarded as the more bioactive form of LA and the form responsible for most of the antioxidant effects and for lowering the redox activities of unbound iron and copper. This theory has been challenged due to the high level of reactivity of the two free sulfhydryls, low intracellular concentrations of DHLA as well as the rapid methylation of one or both sulfhydryls, rapid side-chain oxidation to shorter metabolites and rapid efflux from the cell. Although both DHLA and LA have been found inside cells after administration, most intracellular DHLA probably exists as mixed disulfides with various cysteine residues from cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins. Recent findings suggest therapeutic and anti-aging effects are due to modulation of signal transduction and gene transcription, which improve the antioxidant status of the cell. However, this likely occurs via pro-oxidant mechanisms, not by radical scavenging or reducing effects. All the disulfide forms of LA (R/S-LA, RLA and SLA) can be reduced to DHLA although both tissue specific and stereoselective (preference for one enantiomer over the other) reductions have been reported in model systems. At least two cytosolic enzymes, glutathione reductase (GR) and thioredoxin reductase (Trx1), and two mitochondrial enzymes, lipoamide dehydrogenase and thioredoxin reductase (Trx2), reduce LA. SLA is stereoselectively reduced by cytosolic GR whereas Trx1, Trx2 and lipoamide dehydrogenase stereoselectively reduce RLA. (R)-(+)-lipoic acid is enzymatically or chemically reduced to (R)-(-)-dihydrolipoic acid whereas (S)-(-)-lipoic acid is reduced to (S)-(+)-dihydrolipoic acid. Dihydrolipoic acid (DHLA) can also form intracellularly and extracellularly via non-enzymatic, thiol-disulfide exchange reactions. RLA may function in vivo like a B-vitamin and at higher doses like plant-derived nutrients, such as curcumin, sulforaphane, resveratrol, and other nutritional substances that induce phase II detoxification enzymes, thus acting as cytoprotective agents. This stress response indirectly improves the antioxidant capacity of the cell. The (S)-enantiomer of LA was shown to be toxic when administered to thiamine-deficient rats. Several studies have demonstrated that SLA either has lower activity than RLA or interferes with the specific effects of RLA by competitive inhibition. == Uses == R/S-LA and RLA are widely available as over-the-counter nutritional supplements in the United States in the form of capsules, tablets, and aqueous liquids, and have been marketed as antioxidants and pertaining to cellular glucose utilization for metabolic disorders and type 2 diabetes. Although the body can synthesize LA, it can also be absorbed from the diet. Dietary supplementation in doses from 200–600 mg is likely to provide up to 1000 times the amount available from a regular diet. Gastrointestinal absorption is variable and decreases with the use of food. It is therefore recommended that dietary LA be taken 30–60 minutes before or at least 120 minutes after a meal. Maximum blood levels of LA are achieved 30–60 minutes after dietary supplementation, and it is thought to be largely metabolized in the liver. In Germany, LA is approved as a drug for the treatment of diabetic neuropathy since 1966 and is available as a non-prescription pharmaceutical. == Clinical research == According to the American Cancer Society as of 2013, \"there is no reliable scientific evidence at this time that lipoic acid prevents the development or spread of cancer\". As of 2015, intravenously administered ALA is unapproved anywhere in the world except Germany for diabetic neuropathy, but has been proven reasonably safe and effective. As of 2012, there was no good evidence alpha lipoic acid helps people with mitochondrial disorders. A 2018 review recommended ALA as an anti-obesity supplement with low dosage (< 600 mg/day) for a short period (<10 weeks). == Other lipoic acids == β-lipoic acid is a thiosulfinate of α-lipoic acid == See also == Aminolevulinic acid == References == == External links == Media related to Lipoic acid at Wikimedia Commons",

         "Medical",
         "Clarithromycin, sold under the brand name Biaxin among others, is an antibiotic used to treat various bacterial infections. This includes strep throat, pneumonia, skin infections, H. pylori infection, and Lyme disease, among others. Clarithromycin can be taken by mouth as a tablet or liquid or can be infused intravenously. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, headaches, and diarrhea. Severe allergic reactions are rare. Liver problems have been reported. It may cause harm if taken during pregnancy. It is in the macrolide class and works by slowing down bacterial protein synthesis. Clarithromycin resistance is already a major challenge to healthcare systems and such resistance is spreading, leading to recommendations to test the susceptibility of pathogenic organisms to the antibiotic before commencing clarithromycin therapy. Clarithromycin was developed in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1990. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Clarithromycin is available as a generic medication. It is made from erythromycin and is chemically known as 6-O-methylerythromycin. == Medical uses == === Antibiotic === Clarithromycin is primarily used to treat a number of bacterial infections including pneumonia, Helicobacter pylori, and as an alternative to penicillin in strep throat. Other uses include cat scratch disease and other infections due to Bartonella, cryptosporidiosis, as a second line agent in Lyme disease and toxoplasmosis. It may also be used to prevent bacterial endocarditis in those who cannot take penicillin. It is effective against upper and lower respiratory tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections and helicobacter pylori infections associated with duodenal ulcers. ==== Spectrum of bacterial susceptibility ==== Aerobic Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes Aerobic Gram-negative bacteria Haemophilus parainfluenzae Haemophilus influenzae Moraxella catarrhalis Helicobacter Helicobacter pylori Mycobacteria Mycobacterium avium complex consisting of: Mycobacterium avium avium Mycobacterium intracellulare Other bacteria Chlamydia pneumoniae Mycoplasma pneumoniae Safety and effectiveness of clarithromycin in treating clinical infections due to the following bacteria have not been established in adequate and well-controlled clinical trials: Aerobic Gram-positive bacteria Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus (Groups C, F, G) Viridans group streptococci Aerobic Gram-negative bacteria Bordetella pertussis Legionella pneumophila Pasteurella multocida Anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria Clostridium perfringens Peptococcus niger Cutibacterium acnes Anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria Prevotella melaninogenica (formerly Bacteroides melaninogenicus) === Idiopathic hypersomnia === Clarithromycin has been researched as a potential treatment for idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) in adults, but the evidence is limited. A 2021 Cochrane study determined that the evidence is inadequate to definitively determine the efficacy of clarithromycin in the management of idiopathic hypersomnia. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine's 2021 clinical practice guidelines conditionally suggested its use, especially for those who don't respond to other therapies. == Contraindications == Clarithromycin should not be taken by people who are allergic to other macrolides or inactive ingredients in the tablets, including microcrystalline cellulose, sodium croscarmellose, magnesium stearate, and povidone Clarithromycin should not be used by people with a history of cholestatic jaundice and/or liver dysfunction associated with prior clarithromycin use. Clarithromycin should not be used in the setting of hypokalaemia (low blood potassium) Use of clarithromycin with the following medications: cisapride, pimozide, astemizole, terfenadine, ergotamine, ticagrelor, ranolazine or dihydroergotamine is not recommended. It should not be used with colchicine in people with kidney or liver impairment. Concomitant use with cholesterol medications such as lovastatin or simvastatin. Hypersensitivity to clarithromycin or any component of the product, erythromycin, or any macrolide antibiotics. QT prolongation or ventricular cardiac arrhythmias, including torsade de pointes. == Side effects == The most common side effects are gastrointestinal: diarrhea (3%), nausea (3%), abdominal pain (3%), and vomiting (6%). It also can cause headaches, insomnia, and abnormal liver function tests. Allergic reactions include rashes and anaphylaxis. Less common side effects (<1%) include extreme irritability, hallucinations (auditory and visual), dizziness/motion sickness, and alteration in senses of smell and taste, including a metallic taste. Dry mouth, panic attacks, and nightmares have also been reported, albeit less frequently. === Cardiac === In February 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a safety communication warning with respect to an increased risk for heart problems or death with the use of clarithromycin, and has recommended that alternative antibiotics be considered in those with heart disease. Clarithromycin can lead to a prolonged QT interval. In patients with long QT syndrome, cardiac disease, or patients taking other QT-prolonging medications, this can increase risk for life-threatening arrhythmias. In one trial, the use of short-term clarithromycin treatment was correlated with an increased incidence of deaths classified as sudden cardiac deaths in stable coronary heart disease patients not using statins. === Liver and kidney === Clarithromycin has been known to cause jaundice, cirrhosis, and kidney problems, including kidney failure. Some case reports suspect it of causing liver disease. === Central nervous system === Common adverse effects of clarithromycin in the central nervous system include dizziness, headaches. Rarely, it can cause ototoxicity, delirium and mania. === Infection === A risk of oral candidiasis and vaginal candidiasis, due to the elimination of the yeast's natural bacterial competitors by the antibiotic, has also been noted. === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Clarithromycin should not be used in pregnant women except in situations where no alternative therapy is appropriate. Clarithromycin can cause potential hazard to the fetus hence should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the fetus. For lactating mothers it is not known whether clarithromycin is excreted in human milk. == Interactions == Clarithromycin inhibits a liver enzyme, CYP3A4, involved in the metabolism of many other commonly prescribed drugs. Taking clarithromycin with other medications that are metabolized by CYP3A4 may lead to unexpected increases or decreases in drug levels. A few of the common interactions are listed below. === Colchicine === Clarithromycin has been observed to have a dangerous interaction with colchicine as the result of inhibition of CYP3A4 metabolism and P-glycoprotein transport. Combining these two drugs may lead to fatal colchicine toxicity, particularly in people with chronic kidney disease. === Statins === Taking clarithromycin concurrently with certain statins (a class of drugs used to reduce blood serum cholesterol levels) increases the risk of side effects, such as muscle aches and muscle break down (rhabdomyolysis). === Calcium channel blockers === Concurrent therapy with calcium channel blocker may increase risk of low blood pressure, kidney failure, and death, compared to pairing calcium channel blockers with azithromycin, a drug similar to clarithromycin but without CYP3A4 inhibition. Administration of clarithromycin in combination with verapamil have been observed to cause low blood pressure, low heart rate, and lactic acidosis. === Carbamazepine === Clarithromycin may double the level of carbamazepine in the body by reducing its clearance, which may lead to toxic symptoms of carbamazepine, such as double vision, loss of voluntary body movement, and nausea, as well as hyponatremia. === HIV medications === Depending on the combination of medications, clarithromycin therapy could be contraindicated, require changing doses of some medications, or be acceptable without dose adjustments. For example, clarithromycin may lead to decreased zidovudine concentrations. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Clarithromycin prevents bacteria from multiplying by acting as a protein synthesis inhibitor. It binds to 23S rRNA, a component of the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, thus inhibiting the translation of peptides. In addition to its antibiotic activity, clarithromycin has been found to act as a negative allosteric modulator of the GABAA receptor. In relation to this action, it may have wakefulness-promoting effects in people with hypersomnia. === Pharmacokinetics === Unlike erythromycin, clarithromycin is acid-stable, so can be taken orally without having to be protected from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed, and diffuses into most tissues and phagocytes. Due to the high concentration in phagocytes, clarithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations of clarithromycin are released; its concentration in the tissues can be over 10 times higher than in plasma. Highest concentrations are found in liver, lung tissue, and stool. ==== Metabolism ==== Clarithromycin has a fairly rapid first-pass metabolism in the liver. Its major metabolites include an inactive metabolite, N-desmethylclarithromycin, and an active metabolite, 14-(R)-hydroxyclarithromycin. Compared to clarithromycin, 14-(R)-hydroxyclarithromycin is less potent against mycobacterial tuberculosis and the Mycobacterium avium complex. Clarithromycin (20%-40%) and its active metabolite (10%-15%) are excreted in urine. Of all the drugs in its class, clarithromycin has the best bioavailability at 50%, which makes it amenable to oral administration. Its elimination half-life is about 3 to 4 hours with 250 mg administered every 12 h, but increased to 5 to 7 h with 500 mg administered every 8 to 12 h. With any of these dosing regimens, the steady-state concentration of this metabolite is generally attained within 3 to 4 days. == History == Clarithromycin was invented by researchers at the Japanese drug company Taisho Pharmaceutical in 1980. The product emerged through efforts to develop a version of the antibiotic erythromycin that did not experience acid instability in the digestive tract, causing side effects, such as nausea and stomachache. Taisho filed for patent protection for the drug around 1980 and subsequently introduced a branded version of its drug, called Clarith, to the Japanese market in 1991. In 1985, Taisho partnered with the American company Abbott Laboratories for the international rights, and Abbott also gained FDA approval for Biaxin in October 1991. The drug went generic in Europe in 2004 and in the US in mid-2005. == Society and culture == === Available forms === Clarithromycin is available as a generic medication. In the United States, clarithromycin is available as immediate-release tablets, extended-release tablets, and granules for oral suspension. === Brand names === Clarithromycin is available under several brand names in many different countries, including Biaxin, Crixan, Claritron, Clarihexal, Clacid, Claritt, Clacee, Clarac, Clariwin, Claripen, Clarem, Claridar, Cloff, Fromilid, Infex, Kalixocin, Karicin, Klaricid, Klaridex, Klacid, Klaram, Klabax, Klerimed, MegaKlar, Monoclar, Resclar, Rithmo, Truclar, Vikrol and Zeclar. === Manufacturers === In the UK the drug product is manufactured in generic form by a number of manufacturers including Somex Pharma, Ranbaxy, Aptil and Sandoz. == Research == === Hypersomnolence === Clarithromycin has been studied in a phase 2 clinical trial in the treatment of central hypersomnolence (i.e., idiopathic hypersomnolence and narcolepsy without cataplexy). There was no apparent improvement on an objective measure of vigilance, but subjective sleepiness was reduced with the drug compared to placebo. It is thought to work for this use as a GABAA receptor negative allosteric modulator. == References == == External links == US patent 4331803, Watanabe Y, Morimoto S, Omura S, \"Novel erythromycin compounds\", issued 1981-05-19, assigned to Taisho Pharmaceutical",

         "Food, Medical",
         "Isoleucine (symbol Ile or I) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated −NH+3 form under biological conditions), an α-carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated −COO− form under biological conditions), and a hydrocarbon side chain with a branch (a central carbon atom bound to three other carbon atoms). It is classified as a non-polar, uncharged (at physiological pH), branched-chain, aliphatic amino acid. It is essential in humans, meaning the body cannot synthesize it. Essential amino acids are necessary in the human diet. In plants isoleucine can be synthesized from threonine and methionine. In plants and bacteria, isoleucine is synthesized from a pyruvate employing leucine biosynthesis enzymes. It is encoded by the codons AUU, AUC, and AUA. == Metabolism == === Biosynthesis === In plants and microorganisms, isoleucine is synthesized from pyruvate and alpha-ketobutyrate. This pathway is not present in humans. Enzymes involved in this biosynthesis include: Acetolactate synthase (also known as acetohydroxy acid synthase) Acetohydroxy acid isomeroreductase Dihydroxyacid dehydratase Valine aminotransferase === Catabolism === Isoleucine is both a glucogenic and a ketogenic amino acid. After transamination with alpha-ketoglutarate, the carbon skeleton is oxidised and split into propionyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA. Propionyl-CoA is converted into succinyl-CoA, a TCA cycle intermediate which can be converted into oxaloacetate for gluconeogenesis (hence glucogenic). In mammals acetyl-CoA cannot be converted to carbohydrate but can be either fed into the TCA cycle by condensing with oxaloacetate to form citrate or used in the synthesis of ketone bodies (hence ketogenic) or fatty acids. === Metabolic diseases === The degradation of isoleucine is impaired in the following metabolic diseases: Combined malonic and methylmalonic aciduria (CMAMMA) Maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) Methylmalonic acidemia Propionic acidemia === Insulin resistance === Isoleucine, like other branched-chain amino acids, is associated with insulin resistance: higher levels of isoleucine are observed in the blood of diabetic mice, rats, and humans. In diet-induced obese and insulin resistant mice, a diet with decreased levels of isoleucine (with or without the other branched-chain amino acids) results in reduced adiposity and improved insulin sensitivity. Reduced dietary levels of isoleucine are required for the beneficial metabolic effects of a low protein diet. In humans, a protein restricted diet lowers blood levels of isoleucine and decreases fasting blood glucose levels. Mice fed a low isoleucine diet are leaner, live longer, and are less frail. In humans, higher dietary levels of isoleucine are associated with greater body mass index. == Functions and requirement == The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the U.S. Institute of Medicine has set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for essential amino acids in 2002. For adults 19 years and older, 19 mg of isoleucine/kg body weight is required daily. Beside its biological role as a nutrient, isoleucine also participates in regulation of glucose metabolism. Isoleucine is an essential component of many proteins. As an essential amino acid, isoleucine must be ingested or protein production in the cell will be disrupted. Fetal hemoglobin is one of the many proteins that require isoleucine. Isoleucine is present in the gamma chain of fetal hemoglobin and must be present for the protein to form. Genetic diseases can change the consumption requirements of isoleucine. Amino acids cannot be stored in the body. Buildup of excess amino acids will cause a buildup of toxic molecules so, humans have many pathways to degrade each amino acid when the need for protein synthesis has been met. Mutations in isoleucine-degrading enzymes can lead to dangerous buildup of isoleucine and its toxic derivative. One example is maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), a disorder that leaves people unable to breakdown isoleucine, valine, and leucine. People with MSUD manage their disease by a reduced intake of all three of those amino acids alongside drugs that help excrete built-up toxins. Many animals and plants are dietary sources of isoleucine as a component of proteins. Foods that have high amounts of isoleucine include eggs, soy protein, seaweed, turkey, chicken, lamb, cheese, and fish. == Synthesis == Routes to isoleucine are numerous. One common multistep procedure starts from 2-bromobutane and diethylmalonate. Synthetic isoleucine was first reported in 1905 by French chemists Bouveault and Locquin. == Discovery == German chemist Felix Ehrlich discovered isoleucine while studying the composition of beet-sugar molasses 1903. In 1907 Ehrlich carried out further studies on fibrin, egg albumin, gluten, and beef muscle in 1907. These studies verified the natural composition of isoleucine. Ehrlich published his own synthesis of isoleucine in 1908. == See also == Alloisoleucine, the diasteromer of isoleucine Low Isoleucine protein foods == References == == External links == Isoleucine degradation Isoleucine biosynthesis",

         "Ipragliflozin (INN,: 69 trade names Suglat) is a pharmaceutical drug for treatment of type 2 diabetes. Ipragliflozin, jointly developed by Astellas Pharma and Kotobuki Pharmaceutical, was approved in Japan on January 17, 2014, and in Russia on May 22, 2019. Ipragliflozin is a Sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor (gliflozin). These membrane proteins are on the cell surface and transfer glucose into the cells. SGLT2 is one subtype of SGLTs and plays a key role in the reuptake of glucose in the proximal tubule of the kidneys. Ipragliflozin reduces blood glucose levels by inhibiting the reuptake of glucose by selectively inhibiting SGLT2. == Clinical trials == The efficacy and safety of ipragliflozin were both observed in a Phase III study in monotherapy and clinical studies used in combination with other hypoglycemic agents (6 types) in Japan. One placebo-controlled, double-blind study was carried out at 18 different sites in Korea and 12 in Taiwan. Patients were above 20 and had type 2 diabetes for atlas 12 weeks. They were given an 8-week period to clear their systems of all other drugs (besides metformin). Patients received either 50 mg ipragliflozin or a placebo. The drugs were identical in all physical forms. The patients were prohibited from using any other anti diabetic drugs, other than metformin. The study ran for 24 weeks along with a 4-week follow-up period. The standard deviation in hemoglobin A1c were −0.94% and −0.47% in the ipragliflozin and placebo groups, respectively (between-group difference −0.46%, p <0.001). The changes in fasting plasma glucose and bodyweight were also significantly greater in the ipragliflozin group, with between-group differences of −14.1 mg/dL and −1.24 kg, respectively (both p <0.001). The most common adverse events that appeared were upper respiratory infections and urinary tract infections. From this it was concluded that ipragliflozin is both efficacious as well as safe. However, ipragliflozin is currently in Observational Case Control clinical trial to see the long-term (over three years) safety of using ipragliflozin. The estimated completion of this trial is October 2018. 18 October 2016: Astellas completes a clinical trial for Type-2 diabetes mellitus in Japan prior to October 2016 7 September 2016: Astellas Pharma plans a phase III trial for Type-1 diabetes mellitus (Combination therapy) in Japan 1 August 2016: Phase III clinical trials in type 1 diabetes mellitus (combination therapy) in Japan Ipragliflozin was also in development for type 2 diabetes mellitus in the U.S., Europe and other countries, and three phase II trials were completed in combination with metformin. This was since discontinued. == Commercialization == As of 2014, Suglat was the top reimbursed drug in Japan. Peak sales reached US$515 million with 800,000 and the cost per patient reached US$644 per year. In 2014, the market for selective SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan was around 9 billion yen. Suglat's share of this market was around 49%. In 2015, sales of Suglat grew 77.8% to 7.3 billion yen, following the availability of long-term prescriptions from May 2015. Suglat's share of the market for selective SGLT2 inhibitors in Japan was around 39%. The projected sales in 2016 is to jump all the way to 12.5 billion yen. == Marketing == Ipragliflozin was the first drug of its kind sold by any company in Japan. Therefore, Astellas will focus their marketing in order to maintain the top share of this market that it holds. Astellas has been building up post-marketing data in regard to the efficacy and safety of ipragliflozin. By supplying information based on this data, Astellas aims to increase the market penetration of ipragliflozin in the Japanese market. In 2015, Astellas additionally launched Suglat in the Republic of Korea and Feburic in Thailand.: 50 == Intellectual Property == In May 2013, Boehringer Ingelheim of Germany applied for a Methods of Treatment, Pharmaceutical Compositions and uses thereof patent. This patent application included SGLT2 inhibitor ipragliflozin. In April 2014, Boehringer Ingelheim applied for usage of SGLT2 inhibitors in equine animals. The usage of these inhibitors in an animal study allows for progression in the application in humans for more than just diabetes. The National Institute of Biological Science out of Beijing filed a similar patent in September 2015. In January 2016, the Dalian University of Technology filed a patent on the synthetic method of ipragliflozin. There are additional patents for the synthesis of the intermediates leading up to these types of inhibitors. == References ==",

         " The bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) protein BRD2-4 inhibitors hold therapeutic promise in preclinical models of hematologic malignancies. However, translation of these data to molecules suitable for clinical development has yet to be accomplished. Herein we expand the mechanistic understanding of BET inhibitors in multiple myeloma by using the chemical probe molecule I-BET151. I-BET151 induces apoptosis and exerts strong antiproliferative effect in vitro and in vivo. This is associated with contrasting effects on oncogenic MYC and HEXIM1, an inhibitor of the transcriptional activator P-TEFb. I-BET151 causes transcriptional repression of MYC and MYC-dependent programs by abrogating recruitment to the chromatin of the P-TEFb component CDK9 in a BRD2-4-dependent manner. In contrast, transcriptional upregulation of HEXIM1 is BRD2-4 independent. Finally, preclinical studies show that I-BET762 has a favorable pharmacologic profile as an oral agent and that it inhibits myeloma cell proliferation, resulting in survival advantage in a systemic myeloma xenograft model. These data provide a strong rationale for extending the clinical testing of the novel antimyeloma agent I-BET762 and reveal insights into biologic pathways required for myeloma cell proliferation. As one of the most fatal malignancies, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has significant resistance to the currently available treatment approaches. Gemcitabine, the standard chemotherapeutic agent for locally advanced and metastatic PDAC, has limited efficacy, which is attributed to innate/acquired resistance and the activation of prosurvival pathways. Here, we investigated the in vitro efficacy of I-BET762, an inhibitor of the bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) family of proteins, in treating PDAC cell lines alone and in combination with gemcitabine (GEM). The effect of these two agents was also examined in xenograft PDAC tumors in mice. We found that I-BET762 induced cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase and cell death and suppressed cell proliferation and metastatic stem cell factors in PDAC cells. In addition, the BH3-only protein Bim, which is related to chemotherapy resistance, was upregulated by I-BET762, which increased the cell death triggered by GEM in PDAC cells. Moreover, GEM and I-BET762 exerted a synergistic effect on cytotoxicity both in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, Bim is necessary for I-BET762 activity and modulates the synergistic effect of GEM and I-BET762 in PDAC. In conclusion, we investigated the effect of I-BET762 on PDAC and suggest an innovative strategy for PDAC treatment.",

         " Molibresib is a selective, small molecule inhibitor of the bromodomain and extra-terminal (BET) protein family. This was an open-label, two-part, Phase I/II study investigating molibresib monotherapy for the treatment of hematological malignancies (NCT01943851). Part 1 (dose escalation) determined the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of molibresib in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), or multiple myeloma. Part 2 (dose expansion) investigated the safety and efficacy of molibresib at the RP2D in patients with relapsed/refractory myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS; as well as AML evolved from antecedent MDS) or cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). The primary endpoint in Part 1 was safety and the primary endpoint in Part 2 was objective response rate (ORR). There were 111 patients enrolled (87 in Part 1, 24 in Part 2). Molibresib RP2Ds of 75 mg daily (for MDS) and 60 mg daily (for CTCL) were selected. Most common Grade 3+ adverse events included thrombocytopenia (37%), anemia (15%), and febrile neutropenia (15%). Six patients achieved complete responses [3 in Part 1 (2 AML, 1 NHL), 3 in Part 2 (MDS)], and 7 patients achieved partial responses [6 in Part 1 (4 AML, 2 NHL), 1 in Part 2 (MDS)]. The ORRs for Part 1, Part 2, and the total study population were 10% [95% confidence interval (CI), 4.8-18.7], 25% (95% CI, 7.3-52.4), and 13% (95% CI, 6.9-20.6), respectively. While antitumor activity was observed with molibresib, use was limited by gastrointestinal and thrombocytopenia toxicities. Investigations of molibresib as part of combination regimens may be warranted. Molibresib (GSK525762), an orally bioavailable small molecule with 2 major equipotent active metabolites, is being developed for the treatment of cancers. Molibresib is a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 and P-glycoprotein (P-gp). To enable administering safe doses of molibresib to healthy volunteers, this 2-part randomized, open-label, crossover drug-drug interaction trial was conducted as an adaptive design study using physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) modeling and simulation to predict the lowest doses of molibresib that could be safely administered alone (10 mg) or with itraconazole and rifampicin (strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A and P-gp, respectively). PBPK simulation guided the molibresib dose (5 mg) to be administered along with itraconazole in part 1. Itraconazole increased total exposure (AUC) of molibresib by 4.15-fold with a 66% increase in C Molibresib (GSK525762) is an investigational, orally bioavailable, small-molecule bromodomain and extraterminal (BET) protein inhibitor for the treatment of advanced solid tumors. Molibresib was initially evaluated in a first-time-in-human (FTIH) study BET115521 consisting of two parts: Part 1 of the study (dose escalation) was conducted in 94 patients with nuclear protein in testis midline carcinoma and other solid tumors, and Part 2 (expansion cohort) was conducted in 99 patients with different solid tumor types. Molibresib is metabolized by cytochrome P450 3A4 enzymes to produce two major active metabolites that are equipotent to the parent molecule. The metabolites are measured together after full conversion of one to the other and reported as an active metabolite composite (GSK3529246). The molibresib pharmacokinetic (PK) profile has been characterized by a decrease in exposure over time, with the decrease more pronounced at higher doses, and accompanied by a slight increase of the metabolite concentrations. Autoinduction of molibresib metabolism was suspected and confirmed in vitro. Here we report the development of a semimechanistic liver-compartment population PK model using PK data from the FTIH study, which adequately describes the autoinduction of molibresib clearance and the PK of both molibresib and GSK3529246. Covariate analysis indicated body weight had a significant effect on the volume of distribution of molibresib and GSK3529246, and higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase resulted in the lower clearance of GSK3529246. This model was used to simulate individual patient exposures based on covariate information for use in future alternative dosing strategies and exposure-response analyses.",

         " Many factors contribute to inadequate diversity in Alzheimer disease (AD) clinical trials. We evaluated eligibility rates among racial and ethnic groups at US sites in large global multisite trials in early AD. Using screening data from 4 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in early AD, we assessed rates of eligibility among racial and ethnic groups controlling for other demographic covariates. Each trial incorporated positron emission tomography and/or cerebrospinal fluid to evaluate brain amyloid pathology, as well as typical eligibility criteria used in early AD trials. Across the trials, 10,804 US participants were screened: 193 (2%) were of Hispanic ethnicity and Black race, 2,624 (25%) were of Hispanic ethnicity and White race, 118 (1%) were of non-Hispanic ethnicity (NH) and Asian race, 696 (7%) were of NH ethnicity and Black race, and 7,017 (65%) were of NH ethnicity and White race. Data from 156 participants who did not fit into these categories were excluded. Accounting for age, sex, and trial and using NH White participants as a reference group, we observed higher probabilities of ineligibility for amyloid biomarker criteria among Hispanic Black (odds ratio [OR] = 3.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.11-4.88), Hispanic White (OR = 4.15, 95% CI = 3.58-4.83), NH Asian (OR = 2.35, 95% CI = 1.23-4.55), and NH Black (OR = 3.75, 95% CI = 2.80-5.06) participants. Differential eligibility may contribute to underrepresentation of some minoritized racial and ethnic groups in early AD trials. Amyloid biomarker eligibility is a requirement to confirm the diagnosis of AD and for treatment with amyloid-lowering drugs and differed among racial and ethnic groups. ANN NEUROL 2024;95:288-298. Elenbecestat, an oral BACE-1 inhibitor that has been shown to reduce Aβ levels in cerebrospinal fluid, was investigated in two global phase 3 studies in early AD. Here we report on differences observed in characteristics of APOE ε4 and amyloid positive subjects in the large screening cohort. Screening was performed in 5 sequential tiers over a maximum of 80 days, as part of placebo controlled, double blind phase 3 studies. Subjects were evaluated at sites in 7 regions (29 countries). Overall, 9758 subjects were screened. All screened subjects that were eligible received either placebo or 50 mg QID elenbecestat post randomisation. Gender, disease staging, APOE ε4 status, amyloid status, amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) standard uptake value ratio (SUVr) and amyloid PET Centiloid (CL) values were determined for screened subjects; by country and region. In this program, 44% of subjects were APOE ε4 positive. Frequency of females was similar in both APOE ε4 positive and negative groups. However, early mild AD subjects were slightly higher in the APOE ε4 positive group compared with the APOE ε4 negative group. 56% of subjects were amyloid positive. The mean age in the amyloid positive group was slightly higher than the amyloid negative group. The gender distribution was similar between amyloid groups. A lower number of mild cognitive impairment was observed in the amyloid positive group along with a higher number of early mild AD. APOE ε4 positive subjects were higher in amyloid positive group compared to the amyloid negative group. China had the lowest APOE ε4 and amyloid positivity rates with Western Europe and Oceania performing best. Subjects received florbetapir, florbetaben or flutemetamol amyloid PET tracer. Amyloid negative and positive subjects CL values were normally distributed around their respective means of 1.5 CL and 83 CL. However, there was an appreciable overlap in the 20-40 CL range. In this large cohort of cognitively impaired subjects, subject demographics characteristics were comparable regardless of APOE genotype or amyloid positivity. APOE ε4 positivity and amyloid positivity varied by country and by geographical region.",

The compound elicited a short-lasting suppressive effect when applied after immunisation; the number of PFC decreased two days after treatment while 5 days after drug administration increased as compared to the untreated animals. Treatment prior to immunisation proved to be ineffective. The titre of circulating antibodies showed changes similar although of lesser extent. Five days following treatment marked infiltration of plasmacytes was present in the axillary lymph nodes. Rats bearing transplantable Guérin tumor showed similar changes in immune response as the tumor free animals following DAD treatment. Mice 2--4 days of age were pretreated with a single 5 mg/kg dose of dianhydrodulcitol (DAD) and later infected intracerebrally with lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM) virus. These animals had a lower mortality rate and died later than the untreated control animals. Thus DAD pretreatment prevented in part of the animals the development of lethal meningitis, the consequence of LCM virus infection, reducing the cellular immune response. This effect of DAD could equally be observed in animals infected at the age of 16--18 days and of 4 weeks. The incorporation of 3H-Dibromodulcitol and 3H-Dianhydrodulcitol into S37 ascites tumor cells has been studied with autoradiography. Both drugs war incorporated very rapidly into the cells.

         "Erlotinib, sold under the brand name Tarceva among others, is a medication used to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and pancreatic cancer. Specifically it is used for NSCLC with mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) — either an exon 19 deletion (del19) or exon 21 (L858R) substitution mutation — which has spread to other parts of the body. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include rash, diarrhea, muscle pain, joint pain, and cough. Serious side effects may include lung problems, kidney problems, liver failure, gastrointestinal perforation, stroke, and corneal ulceration. Use in pregnancy may harm the baby. It is a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which acts on the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Erlotinib was approved for medical use in the United States in 2004. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == === Lung cancer === Erlotinib in unresectable non-small cell lung cancer when added to chemotherapy improves overall survival by 19%, and improved progression-free survival (PFS) by 29%, when compared to chemotherapy alone. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved erlotinib for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer that has failed at least one prior chemotherapy regimen. In lung cancer, erlotinib has been shown to be effective in patients with or without EGFR mutations, but appears to be more effective in patients with EGFR mutations. Overall survival, progression-free survival and one-year survival are similar to standard second-line therapy (docetaxel or pemetrexed). Overall response rate is about 50% better than standard second-line chemotherapy. Patients who are non-smokers, and light former smokers, with adenocarcinoma or subtypes like BAC are more likely to have EGFR mutations, but mutations can occur in all types of patients. A test for the EGFR mutation has been developed by Genzyme. === Pancreatic cancer === In November 2005, the FDA approved erlotinib in combination with gemcitabine for treatment of locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic pancreatic cancer. === Resistance to treatment === As with other ATP competitive small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, such as imatinib in CML, patients rapidly develop resistance. In the case of erlotinib this typically occurs 8–12 months from the start of treatment. Over 50% of resistance is caused by a mutation in the ATP binding pocket of the EGFR kinase domain involving substitution of a small polar threonine residue with a large nonpolar methionine residue (T790M). Approximately 20% of drug resistance is caused by amplification of the hepatocyte growth factor receptor, which drives ERBB3 dependent activation of PI3K. == Side effects == === Common === Rash occurs in the majority of patients. This resembles acne and primarily involves the face and neck. It is self-limited and resolves in the majority of cases, even with continued use. Some clinical studies have indicated a correlation between the severity of the skin reactions and increased survival though this has not been quantitatively assessed. The Journal of Clinical Oncology reported in 2004 that \"cutaneous [skin] rash seems to be a surrogate marker of clinical benefit, but this finding should be confirmed in ongoing and future studies.\" The newsletter Lung Cancer Frontiers reported in its October 2003 issue, \"Patients with moderate to severe cutaneous reactions [rashes] have a far better survival, than those with only mild reactions and much better than those with no cutaneous manifestations of drug effects.\" Diarrhea Loss of appetite Fatigue Partial hair loss (by strands, not typically in clumps) === Rare === interstitial pneumonitis, which is characterized by cough and increased dyspnea.

Also, erlotinib is not an inhibitor of OATP-1B1 or OATP-1B3 transporter. Erlotinib is mainly metabolized by the liver enzyme CYP3A4. Compounds which induce this enzyme (i.e. stimulate its production), such as St John's wort, can lower erlotinib concentrations, while inhibitors can increase concentrations. == Mechanism == Erlotinib is an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor (EGFR inhibitor). The drug follows Iressa (gefitinib), which was the first drug of this type. Erlotinib specifically targets the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase, which is highly expressed and occasionally mutated in various forms of cancer. It binds in a reversible fashion to the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) binding site of the receptor. For the signal to be transmitted, two EGFR molecules need to come together to form a homodimer. These then use the molecule of ATP to trans-phosphorylate each other on tyrosine residues, which generates phosphotyrosine residues, recruiting the phosphotyrosine-binding proteins to EGFR to assemble protein complexes that transduce signal cascades to the nucleus or activate other cellular biochemical processes. When erlotinib binds to EGFR, formation of phosphotyrosine residues in EGFR is not possible and the signal cascades are not initiated. == Society and culture == It is marketed in the United States by Genentech and OSI Pharmaceuticals and elsewhere by Roche. The drug's U.S. patent expired in 2020. In May 2012, the US District Court of Delaware passed an order in favor of OSI Pharmaceutical LLC against Mylan Pharmaceuticals upholding the validity of the patent for Erlotinib. In India, generic pharmaceutical firm Cipla is battling with Roche against the Indian patent for this drug. == References == == External links == \"Erlotinib\". National Cancer Institute.",

We examined the protective effects and possible mechanism of action of E3330 in three different endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide)-induced murine hepatitis models, in which tumor necrosis factor is suggested to play a critical role in the pathogenesis. One of these models was induced by i.v. injection of lipopolysaccharide in combination with D-galactosamine to mice. Oral pretreatment with E3330 improved the survival rate and attenuated the increase in plasma aminotransferase activities of the survivors. The other two models were induced by i.v. injection of lipopolysaccharide or a mixture of D-galactosamine and lipopolysaccharide in Propionibacterium acnes-primed mice. In both of these models, tumor necrosis factor was detected in the plasma within 3 hr of the injection. Oral pretreatment with E3330 attenuated the elevation of plasma tumor necrosis factor activity and protected mice from liver injury. Furthermore, E3330 inhibited the production of tumor necrosis factor from cultured Propionibacterium acnes-elicited murine peritoneal macrophages on stimulation with lipopolysaccharide in vitro. These findings suggest that the inhibition by E3330 of tumor necrosis factor production is the major mechanism of the protective effect of E3330 in these endotoxin-mediated hepatitis models in mice.",

         "Ulotaront (INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name; developmental codes SEP-363856, SEP-856) is an investigational antipsychotic that is undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease psychosis. The medication was discovered in collaboration between PsychoGenics Inc. and Sunovion Pharmaceuticals (which was subsequently merged into Sumitomo Pharma) using PsychoGenics' behavior and AI-based phenotypic drug discovery platform, SmartCube. Ulotaront is in phase III clinical trial for schizophrenia, phase II/III for generalized anxiety disorder and major depressive disorder, and discontinued for narcolepsy and psychotic disorders. Research has shown that ulotaront results in a greater reduction from baseline in the PANSS total score than placebo. Treatment with ulotaront, as compared with placebo, was also associated with an improvement in sleep quality. Ulotaront was awarded a Breakthrough Therapy designation due to its increased efficacy and greatly reduced side effects compared to current treatments. == Adverse effects == Some adverse events reported in preliminary clinical trials are somnolence, agitation, nausea, diarrhea, and dyspepsia. The adverse effect profile of ulotaront differs from that of other antipsychotics because its mechanism of action does not involve antagonism of dopamine receptors in the brain, which is responsible for the drug-induced movement disorders (like akathisia) that may occur with those agents. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === The mechanism of action of ulotaront in the treatment of schizophrenia is unclear. However, it is thought to be an agonist at the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) and serotonin 5-HT1A receptors. This mechanism of action is unique among available antipsychotics, which generally antagonize dopamine receptors (especially dopamine D2 receptor). Ulotaront is a full agonist of the human TAAR1 with an EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration of 140 nM and an EmaxTooltip maximal efficacy of 101.3%. It is also a partial agonist of the serotonin 5-HT1A receptor (EC50 = 2,300 nM; Emax = 74.7%) and of the serotonin 5-HT1D receptor (EC50 = 262 nM; Emax = 57.1%). Conversely, its activities at various other targets, such as various other serotonin receptors as well as adrenergic and dopamine receptors, are much less potent. Ulotaront decreases basal locomotor activity in rodents and this effect was absent in TAAR1 knockout mice. It prevented the hyperlocomotion induced by the NMDA receptor antagonist phencyclidine (PCP). Conversely, ulotaront did not affect dextroamphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion. Similarly, it did not reverse apomorphine-induced climbing behavior. === Pharmacokinetics === The precise pharmacokinetic profile of ulotaront has not been reported, though the developer has suggested that the pharmacokinetic data supports once daily dosing. == Research == As of 2018, Sunovion, the maker of another antipsychotic called lurasidone (Latuda), is conducting clinical trials on ulotaront in partnership with the preclinical research company PsychoGenics. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted ulotaront the breakthrough therapy designation. In addition to schizophrenia, ulotaront is also being studied for the treatment of psychosis associated with Parkinson's disease. The Brief Negative Symptom Scale (BNSS) has been used to assess the effect of Ulotaront on the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. In July 2023, the pharmaceutical company behind the drug announced that the drug had failed to outperform placebo in the treatment of acutely psychotic patients with schizophrenia, as measured by the PANSS. == See also == List of investigational antipsychotics § Monoamine receptor modulators Ralmitaront == References ==",

         "Butenafine, sold under the brand names Lotrimin Ultra, Mentax, and Butop (In India only), is a synthetic benzylamine derived antifungal drug. It is structurally related to the allylamine antifungals terbinafine & naftifine. == Medical uses == Butenafine is indicated for the topical treatment of tinea (pityriasis) versicolor due to Malassezia furfur, as well as athlete's foot (Tinea pedis), ringworm (Tinea corporis) and jock itch (Tinea cruris) due to Epidermophyton floccosum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Trichophyton rubrum, and Trichophyton tonsurans. It also displays superior activity against Candida albicans than terbinafine and naftifine. Butenafine demonstrates low minimum inhibitory concentrations against Cryptococcus and Aspergillus. There is some evidence that it is effective against dermatophyte infections of the toenails, but needs to be applied daily for prolonged periods (at least one year). === Available forms === Butenafine is typically available as a 1% topical cream. == Pharmacology == Like the allylamine antifungals (e.g terbinafine), butenafine works by inhibiting the synthesis of ergosterol by binding to and inhibiting squalene epoxidase, an enzyme in the pathway used for creation of the sterols needed in fungal cell membranes. Lacking ergosterol, the cell membranes increase in permeability, allowing their contents to leak out. Furthermore, inhibition of squalene epoxidase leads to a toxic buildup of squalene. This double action of butenafine (increased membrane permeability and toxic buildup of squalene) makes butenafine fungicidal rather than merely fungistatic. In addition to being an antifungal, butenafine is an anti inflammatory. Because fungal skin infections are often accompanied by significant inflammation, this is a desirable property. The fact that butenafine has intrinsic anti inflammatory properties is also desirable since it is not necessary to add topical glucocorticoids, which often come with undesired side effects. == Chemistry == Butenafine hydrochloride is an odorless white crystalline powder that is freely soluble in methanol, ethanol, and chloroform, yet is only slightly soluble in water. == Synthesis == Reductive amination of 1-naphthaldehyde (1) with methylamine (2) gives the intermediate secondary amine (3). Alkylation of this with p-tert-butyl benzyl bromide (4) yields the tertiary amine butenafine. == References ==",

However, the PRS was developed mainly based on the analysis of Caucasian genomes and has not been validated for East Asians. We aimed to evaluate the PRS in the genomes of Korean early-onset AMI patients (n = 265, age ≤50 years) following PCI and controls (n = 636) to examine whether the PRS improves risk prediction beyond conventional risk factors. The odds ratio of the PRS was 1.83 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.69-1.99) for early-onset AMI patients compared with the controls. For the classification of patients, the area under the curve (AUC) for the combined model with the six conventional risk factors (diabetes mellitus, family history of CAD, hypertension, body mass index, hypercholesterolemia, and current smoking) and PRS was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.90-0.94) while that for the six conventional risk factors was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.85-0.93). Although the AUC for PRS alone was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.61-0.69), adding the PRS to the six conventional risk factors significantly improved the accuracy of the prediction model (P = 0.015). Patients with the upper 50% of PRS showed a higher frequency of repeat revascularization (hazard ratio = 2.19, 95% CI: 1.47-3.26) than the others. The PRS using 265 early-onset AMI genomes showed improvement in the identification of patients in the Korean population and showed potential for genomic screening in early life to complement conventional risk prediction.",

In this double-blind, placebo-controlled phase Ib/II study (NCT02407054), following a lead-in segment for evaluating safety and pharmacokinetics of samotolisib and enzalutamide combination, patients with advanced castration-resistant prostate cancer with progression on prior abiraterone were randomized to receive enzalutamide (160 mg daily)/samotolisib (200 mg twice daily) or placebo. Primary endpoint was progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Working Group criteria (PCWG2). Secondary and exploratory endpoints included radiographic PFS (rPFS) and biomarkers, respectively. Log-rank tests assessed treatment group differences. Overall, 13 and 129 patients were enrolled in phase Ib and II, respectively. Dose-limiting toxicity was not reported in patients during phase Ib and mean samotolisib exposures remained in the targeted range despite a 35% decrease when administered with enzalutamide. In phase II, median PCWG2-PFS and rPFS was significantly longer in the samotolisib/enzalutamide versus placebo/enzalutamide arm (3.8 vs. 2.8 months; P = 0.003 and 10.2 vs. 5.5 months; P = 0.03), respectively. Patients without androgen receptor splice variant 7 showed a significant and clinically meaningful rPFS benefit in the samotolisib/enzalutamide versus placebo/enzalutamide arm (13.2 months vs. 5.3 months; P = 0.03). Samotolisib/enzalutamide has tolerable side effects and significantly improved PFS in patients with mCRPC with cancer progression on abiraterone, and this may be enriched in patients with PTEN intact and no androgen receptor splice variant 7. Patients age 1-21 years with relapsed or refractory solid and CNS tumors were assigned to phase II studies of molecularly targeted therapies on the National Cancer Institute-Children's Oncology Group (NCI-COG) Pediatric Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (MATCH) trial. Patients whose tumors harbored predefined genetic alterations in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and lacked mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway activating alterations were treated with the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor samotolisib. Patients received samotolisib twice daily in 28-day cycles until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. A rolling 6 limited dose escalation was performed as, to our knowledge, this was the first pediatric study of samotolisib. The primary end point was the objective response rate; secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS) and the recommended phase II dose and toxicity of samotolisib in children. A total of 3.4% (41/1,206) of centrally tested patients were matched to this arm. Seventeen patients were treated. Among treated patients, the most common diagnoses included osteosarcoma (n = 6) and high-grade glioma (n = 5) harboring alterations in phosphatase and tensin homolog (n = 6),  This nationwide study was successful at identifying patients and evaluating the efficacy of molecularly targeted therapy for rare molecular subgroups of patients in a histology-agnostic fashion. Unfortunately, there was no activity of samotolisib against tumors with PI3K/mTOR pathway alterations. Prospective trials such as the NCI-COG Pediatric MATCH are necessary to evaluate the efficacy of molecularly targeted therapies given their increasing use in clinical practice. Acute liver injury (ALI) is associated with poor survival in patients with sepsis. During sepsis, the liver is the main site of bacterial endotoxin-induced inflammation. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) promotes caspase-4/5/11 activation, leading to pyroptosis, a major sepsis driver. This study aimed to identify novel drugs that can control hepatocyte caspase-4/5/11 activation during sepsis. We performed LPS-induced caspase-11 activation and pyroptosis in RAW 264.7 cells and established an LPS-induced ALI mouse model. We identified samotolisib (ST), a novel dual phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor, by screening a library of 441 pyroptosis compounds with known targets, which dose-dependently inhibited caspase-11 activation and N-terminal fragment of gasdermin D (GSDMD-NT) generation, reducing RAW 264.7 cell pyroptosis. In mice, ST preconditioning improved survival, attenuated LPS-induced serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase activity, and inhibited severe liver inflammation and damage. Importantly, ST treatment activated Nedd4, which directly interacts with and mediates caspase-11 ubiquitination and degradation. This was largely abrogated by insulin-like growth factor 1. ST ameliorated LPS-induced hepatotoxicity by inhibiting caspase-11/GSDMD-NT pyroptosis signaling via regulating PI3K/AKT/mTOR/Nedd4 signaling. Hence, ST may play a key role in the prevention of liver injury in patients with sepsis.",

It is a second-generation antihistamine and takes effect by selectively inhibiting the histamine H1 receptor, preventing these allergic reactions. Bilastine has an effectiveness similar to cetirizine, fexofenadine, and desloratadine. Bilastine was discovered by the Spanish firm FAES Farma and received its first approval in the European Union in 2010 for the symptomatic treatment of allergic rhinoconjunctivitis and urticaria. It is also approved in Canada and Australia. As of 2023, it remained unapproved for any use in the United States, although Hikma Pharmaceuticals had agreed in 2021 to begin the FDA approval process. Evidence has shown that bilastine is effective in treating skin and eye symptoms of allergic reactions, improving patient's quality of life.

Non-nasal symptoms (itchy eye, watery eye, itchy ear, and palate) were also assessed according to a 0–3 scale, so that the Total Symptoms Score (TSS) and other related parameters could clearly reflect daily evolution of SAR in each patient and treatment group. Parameters such as quality of life and discomfort were also assessed, and in the same way the type and frequency of AE, tolerability and general safety of treatment were registered. In this SAR studies the daily oral administration during 14 days of bilastine proves to have the same efficacy as the administration of cetirizine and desloratadine. === Urticaria === A review article evaluated data from trials which detailed the efficacy of bilastine in skin models and urticaria to assess whether bilastine has an optimal profile for updosing in urticaria. The authors concluded that bilastine has an excellent profile for both efficacy and safety, although there is a need for controlled clinical trials to compare the efficacy of bilastine in a real-life updosing study in patients with urticaria, paying special attention to itch control. === Dosage and administration === Bilastine comes as a tablet taken by mouth (PO) and it is supposed to be swallowed whole with water. Bilastine should not be given with, or within 1 hour before or 2 hours after, food as it may reduce its effectiveness. Australian dosing guidelines for Allertine give a maximum dose of 20 mg (one tablet) daily as needed (PRN). Dose changes are not required for hepatic or renal impairment. While the onset of its effects vary between formulations, bilastine generally takes effect within 30–60 minutes. It should be taken only by children older than 4 years and adults, or anyone over 12 years for Allertine. == Side effects == Toxicity of bilastine investigated in preclinical toxicology studies in mice, rats and dogs after oral and intravenous administration showed no mortality observed after oral administration of massive doses. After intravenous administration, LD50 (lethal dose for 50% of animals) values were 33 and 45–75 mg/kg in mice and rats, respectively. No signs of toxicity were observed in any organ after bilastine massive overdosing, either orally (in mice, rats and dogs), or intravenously (in rats and dogs) during 4 weeks. No effects on fertility, no teratogenic or mutagenic effects, and no apparent carcinogenic potential were seen in the studies carried out in rats, mice and rabbits. In clinical research, bilastine has proven to be well tolerated, with an adverse events profile similar to that of placebo in healthy volunteers, patients with AR and with chronic idiopathic urticaria. Although the tolerance profile of bilastine and levocetirizine or desloratadine were very similar, bilastine was markedly better tolerated than cetirizine in a clinical assay in SAR, with fewer adverse events in the bilastine group. No anticholinergic adverse events were observed in the clinical trials with bilastine. No serious adverse events were reported during the research and there were no clinically significant changes in vital signs, electrocardiography (ECG) or laboratory tests. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles and studies in special populations indicate that dose adjustment of bilastine is not necessary in elderly patients or in chronic liver disease or chronic kidney disease. === Cardiac safety === The clinical cardiac safety of bilastine has been assessed in many clinical trials performed (more than 3,500 patients treated with bilastine) and in a phase I study (Thorough QT/QTc study) designed according to the ICH E14 guidance and the most demanding requirements from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).When electrocardiograms (ECG) data from all of the phase I studies are analysed, no significant alteration is appreciated in any of the parameters after administering bilastine at single doses (up to 11 times the therapeutic dose), nor at multiple doses (up to 10 times the therapeutic dose). Phase II and III studies on AR and urticaria (including the open-label extension phase of 12 months) do not reveal alterations in the ECG, nor significant prolongations of the QTc interval after administration of bilastine 20 mg. The Thorough QT/QTc study was designed to assess the effect on the QT/QTc interval, both of the therapeutic dose (20 mg) and 100 mg of bilastine, but also the coadministration of the therapeutic dose with usual doses of ketoconazol (400 mg/day), a metabolism inhibitor and a P-gP dependent transport system. It was verified that bilastine 20 and 100 mg administered during 4 days, does not induce significant changes in the QT/QTc interval duration in any of the individuals. Likewise, coadministration of bilastine 20 mg and ketoconazol 400 mg does not produce any significant prolongation of the QT/QTc interval attributable to bilastine. == Interactions == Preclinical data suggest the possibility of interactions between bilastine and drugs or food that are inhibitors or inducers of the P-glycoproteins. Coadministration of bilastine and grapefruit juice (a known P-glycoprotein-mediated drug transport activator) significantly reduced bilastine systemic exposure. This interaction is due to the known effect of grapefruit flavonoids on intestinal transporter systems such as P-glycoproteins and organic anion transporting peptide (OATP). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Bilastine binds to guinea-pig cerebellar histamine H1-receptors (Ki=44 nM) and to human recombinant histamine H1-receptors (Ki=64 nM) with an affinity comparable to that of astemizole and diphenhydramine, and superior than that of cetirizine by three-fold and fexofenadine by five-fold (Corcóstegui). In different murine models, bilastine by oral route, antagonizes the effects of histamine in a dose-dependent manner, with potency similar to that of cetirizine and between 5.5 and 10 times greater than that of fexofenadine. Preclinical investigations demonstrate the affinity and specificity of bilastine for histamine H1-receptors compared with other histamine receptors subtypes and other 30 receptors from different amines. In vivo experimentation confirmed the antihistaminic and antiallergic activity, which was at least comparable to that of other second-generation H1-antihistamines such as cetirizine. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Bilastine is most quickly absorbed with the absence of food, and reaches a mean peak plasma concentration of 220 ng/mL approximately 1 h after both single and multiple dosing. Absorption is reduced by a high-fat breakfast or fruit juice, and the estimated global oral bioavailability is approximately 60%. Bilastine has linear pharmacokinetics in the 2.5–220 mg dose range in healthy adult subjects without evidence of accumulation after 14 days of treatment. ==== Distribution ==== Bilastine distribution has an apparent volume of distribution of 1.29 L/kg, and has an elimination half-life of 14.5 h and plasma protein binding of 84–90%. Bilastine is a peripherally selective drug, and this is thought to be due to limited brain uptake caused by binding to P-glycoprotein. ==== Metabolism ==== Bilastine is not significantly metabolized in humans and is largely eliminated unchanged both in urine and feces – a third and two thirds of the administered dose, respectively, according to a Phase I mass-balance study with radiolabeled bilastine. Bilastine does not readily cross the blood brain barrier and is not metabolized by the liver. Ninety six percent of the administered dose is eliminated within 24 hours. In relation to its antihistamine effect, oral doses of 20 mg daily of bilastine, measured as skin wheal-and-flare surface areas for 24 h, bilastine is capable of inhibiting 50% of the surface areas – throughout the whole administration interval. == Chemistry == Bilastine, or 2-[4-[2-[4-[1-(2-ethoxyethyl) benzimidazol-2-yl] piperidin-1-yl] ethyl] phenyl]-2-methylpropionic acid, is a molecule with a molecular weight of 463.6 daltons and a chemical structure similar to piperidinyl-benzimidazole. Bilastine can be therefore classified into the same chemical group as many of the new antihistamines on the market, although it is not structurally derived, nor is it a metabolite or enantiomer of any of them, but an original molecule designed with the intent of fulfilling all the requirements of a second-generation antihistamine. === Research === Clinical studies using different dosages were done on histamine-induced wheal and flare reaction over a 24-h period, compared with a single 10 mg oral dose of cetirizine. The results of this research indicated that bilastine was at least as efficient as cetirizine in reducing histamine-mediated effects in healthy volunteers. Notably, 20 and 50 mg of bilastine reduced the wheal and flare reaction faster than cetirizine. == References ==",

         "Endogenous, Food, Medical",
         "Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, abbreviated NADP or, in older notation, TPN (triphosphopyridine nucleotide), is a cofactor used in anabolic reactions, such as the Calvin cycle and lipid and nucleic acid syntheses, which require NADPH as a reducing agent ('hydrogen source'). NADPH is the reduced form, whereas NADP+ is the oxidized form. NADP+ is used by all forms of cellular life. NADP+ is essential for life because it is needed for cellular respiration. NADP+ differs from NAD+ by the presence of an additional phosphate group on the 2' position of the ribose ring that carries the adenine moiety. This extra phosphate is added by NAD+ kinase and removed by NADP+ phosphatase. == Biosynthesis == === NADP+ === In general, NADP+ is synthesized before NADPH is. Such a reaction usually starts with NAD+ from either the de-novo or the salvage pathway, with NAD+ kinase adding the extra phosphate group. ADP-ribosyl cyclase allows for synthesis from nicotinamide in the salvage pathway, and NADP+ phosphatase can convert NADPH back to NADH to maintain a balance. Some forms of the NAD+ kinase, notably the one in mitochondria, can also accept NADH to turn it directly into NADPH. The prokaryotic pathway is less well understood, but with all the similar proteins the process should work in a similar way. === NADPH === NADPH is produced from NADP+. The major source of NADPH in animals and other non-photosynthetic organisms is the pentose phosphate pathway, by glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) in the first step. The pentose phosphate pathway also produces pentose, another important part of NAD(P)H, from glucose. Some bacteria also use G6PDH for the Entner–Doudoroff pathway, but NADPH production remains the same. Ferredoxin–NADP+ reductase, present in all domains of life, is a major source of NADPH in photosynthetic organisms including plants and cyanobacteria. It appears in the last step of the electron chain of the light reactions of photosynthesis. It is used as reducing power for the biosynthetic reactions in the Calvin cycle to assimilate carbon dioxide and help turn the carbon dioxide into glucose. It has functions in accepting electrons in other non-photosynthetic pathways as well: it is needed in the reduction of nitrate into ammonia for plant assimilation in nitrogen cycle and in the production of oils. There are several other lesser-known mechanisms of generating NADPH, all of which depend on the presence of mitochondria in eukaryotes. The key enzymes in these carbon-metabolism-related processes are NADP-linked isoforms of malic enzyme, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH), and glutamate dehydrogenase. In these reactions, NADP+ acts like NAD+ in other enzymes as an oxidizing agent. The isocitrate dehydrogenase mechanism appears to be the major source of NADPH in fat and possibly also liver cells. These processes are also found in bacteria. Bacteria can also use a NADP-dependent glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase for the same purpose. Like the pentose phosphate pathway, these pathways are related to parts of glycolysis. Another carbon metabolism-related pathway involved in the generation of NADPH is the mitochondrial folate cycle, which uses principally serine as a source of one-carbon units to sustain nucleotide synthesis and redox homeostasis in mitochondria. Mitochondrial folate cycle has been recently suggested as the principal contributor to NADPH generation in mitochondria of cancer cells. NADPH can also be generated through pathways unrelated to carbon metabolism. The ferredoxin reductase is such an example. Nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase transfers the hydrogen between NAD(P)H and NAD(P)+, and is found in eukaryotic mitochondria and many bacteria. There are versions that depend on a proton gradient to work and ones that do not. Some anaerobic organisms use NADP+-linked hydrogenase, ripping a hydride from hydrogen gas to produce a proton and NADPH. Like NADH, NADPH is fluorescent. NADPH in aqueous solution excited at the nicotinamide absorbance of ~335 nm (near UV) has a fluorescence emission which peaks at 445-460 nm (violet to blue). NADP+ has no appreciable fluorescence. == Function == NADPH provides the reducing agents, usually hydrogen atoms, for biosynthetic reactions and the oxidation-reduction involved in protecting against the toxicity of reactive oxygen species (ROS), allowing the regeneration of glutathione (GSH). NADPH is also used for anabolic pathways, such as cholesterol synthesis, steroid synthesis, ascorbic acid synthesis, xylitol synthesis, cytosolic fatty acid synthesis and microsomal fatty acid chain elongation. The NADPH system is also responsible for generating free radicals in immune cells by NADPH oxidase. These radicals are used to destroy pathogens in a process termed the respiratory burst. It is the source of reducing equivalents for cytochrome P450 hydroxylation of aromatic compounds, steroids, alcohols, and drugs. == Stability == NADH and NADPH are very stable in basic solutions, but NAD+ and NADP+ are degraded in basic solutions into a fluorescent product that can be used conveniently for quantitation. Conversely, NADPH and NADH are degraded by acidic solutions while NAD+/NADP+ are fairly stable to acid. == Enzymes that use NADP(H) as a coenzyme == Many enzymes that bind NADP share a common super-secondary structure named named the \"Rossmann fold\". The initial beta-alpha-beta (βαβ) fold is the most conserved segment of the Rossmann folds. This segment is in contact with the ADP portion of NADP. Therefore, it is also called an \"ADP-binding βαβ fold\". Adrenodoxin reductase: This enzyme is present ubiquitously in most organisms. It transfers two electrons from NADPH to FAD. In vertebrates, it serves as the first enzyme in the chain of mitochondrial P450 systems that synthesize steroid hormones. == Enzymes that use NADP(H) as a substrate == In 2018 and 2019, the first two reports of enzymes that catalyze the removal of the 2' phosphate of NADP(H) in eukaryotes emerged. First the cytoplasmic protein MESH1 (Q8N4P3), then the mitochondrial protein nocturnin were reported. Of note, the structures and NADPH binding of MESH1 (5VXA) and nocturnin (6NF0) are not related. == References ==",

Guanethidine is transported across the sympathetic nerve membrane by the same mechanism that transports norepinephrine itself (NET, uptake 1), and uptake is essential for the drug's action. Once guanethidine has entered the nerve, it is concentrated in transmitter vesicles, where it replaces norepinephrine. It may also inhibit the release of granules by decreasing norepinephrine. == Medical uses == Guanethidine was once a mainstay for hypertension resistant to other agents, and was often used safely during pregnancy, but it is no longer used in the US due to lack of availability. It is still licensed in some countries, e.g., UK, for the rapid control of blood pressure in a hypertensive emergency.

(In this it competes with norepinephrine so can potentiate exogenously applied norepinephrine.)

         "Ivabradine, sold under the brand name Procoralan among others, is a medication, which is a pacemaker current (If) inhibitor, used for the symptomatic management of heart-related chest pain and heart failure. Patients who qualify for use of ivabradine for congestive heart failure are patients who have symptomatic heart failure, with reduced ejection fraction, and heart rate at least 70 bpm, and the condition not able to be fully managed by beta blockers. Ivabradine acts by allowing negative chronotropy in the sinoatrial structure, thus reducing the heart rate via specific inhibition of the pacemaker current. It operates by a mechanism different from that of beta blockers and calcium channel blockers, which are two commonly prescribed antianginal classes of cardiac drugs. Ivabradine has no apparent inotropic properties and may be a cardiotonic agent. == Medical uses == It is used for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina pectoris in patients with normal sinus rhythm who cannot take beta blockers. It is also being used off-label in the treatment of inappropriate sinus tachycardia (IST). Ivabradine stands as a pharmacological option for controlling HR and rhythm without associated side effects in postoperative CABG patients with IST. === Chest pain === Ivabradine is as effective as the beta blocker atenolol and comparable with amlodipine in the management of chronic stable angina, as demonstrated by improvements in total exercise duration in non-inferiority trials, hence it can be an alternative therapy for those who cannot tolerate conventional therapies. In people not sufficiently managed with beta blockers for their angina, adding ivabradine can further reduce heart rate and improve total exercise duration. === Heart failure === It is used in combination with beta blockers in people with heart failure with LVEF lower than 35 percent inadequately controlled by beta blockers alone and whose heart rate exceeds 70 beats per minute. In people not sufficiently managed with beta blockers for their heart failure adding ivabradine decreases the risk of hospitalization for heart failure. === Tachycardia === The clinical use of ivabradine is predicated on its mechanism of action on sinoatrial nodal tissue where it selectively inhibits the funny current (If) and results in a decrease in heart rate. Ivabradine’s most frequent application in electrophysiology is for the treatment of inappropriate sinus tachycardia. Its use for inappropriate sinus tachycardia is not a European Medicines Agency or Food and Drug Administration approved indication for ivabradine. It has been used experimentally for the treatment of postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome in patients with long COVID. It was used for POTS prior to this too. Many cardiologists have found success with this in their POTS patients. == Contraindications == Ivabradine is contraindicated in sick sinus syndrome. It should also not be used concomitantly with potent inhibitors of CYP3A4, including azole antifungals (such as ketoconazole), macrolide antibiotics, nefazodone and the antiretroviral drugs nelfinavir and ritonavir. Use of ivabradine with verapamil or diltiazem is contraindicated. == Adverse effects == Overall, 14.5% of patients taking ivabradine experience luminous phenomena (by patients described as sensations of enhanced brightness in a fully maintained visual field). This is probably due to blockage of Ih ion channels in the retina, which are very similar to cardiac If. These symptoms are mild, transient, and fully reversible. In clinical studies, about 1% of all patients had to discontinue the drug because of these sensations, which occurred on average 40 days after the drug was started. In a large clinical trial, bradycardia (unusually slow heart rate) occurred in 2% and 5% of patients taking ivabradine at doses of 7.5 and 10 mg respectively (compared to 4.3% in those taking atenolol). Headaches were reported in 2.6 to 4.8 percent of cases. Other common adverse drug reactions (1–10% of patients) include first-degree AV block, ventricular extrasystoles, dizziness and/or blurred vision. == Mechanism of action == Ivabradine acts on the If (f is for \"funny\", so called because it had unusual properties compared with other current systems known at the time of its discovery) ion current, which is highly expressed in the sinoatrial node. If is a mixed Na+–K+ inward current activated by hyperpolarization and modulated by the autonomic nervous system. It is one of the most important ionic currents for regulating pacemaker activity in the sinoatrial (SA) node. Ivabradine selectively inhibits the pacemaker If current in a dose-dependent manner. Blocking this channel reduces cardiac pacemaker activity, selectively slowing the heart rate and allowing more time for blood to flow to the myocardium. By inhibiting the If channel, ivabradine reduces the heart rate and workload on the heart. This is relevant in the usage of the medication to treat angina as well as congestive heart failure. This is in contrast to other commonly used rate-reducing medications, such as beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers, which not only reduce heart rate, but also the cardiac contractility. Given the selective decrease in rate without loss of contractility, ivabradine may prove efficacious for treatment of congestive heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. Ivabradine binds to HCN4 receptors (potassium/sodium hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 4), utilizing Y506, F509 and I510 residues. == Clinical trials == === Coronary artery disease === The BEAUTIFUL study randomised over 10917 patients having stable coronary artery disease and left ventricle dysfunction (ejection fraction < 40%). Ivabradine did not show a significant reduction in the primary composite endpoint of cardiovascular death, admission to hospital for acute myocardial infarction, and admission to hospital for new onset or worsening heart failure. However, in a prespecified subgroup of patients with a baseline heart rate of more than 70 bpm, ivabradine significantly reduced the following secondary endpoints: Coronary events by 22% (P=0.023) Fatal and nonfatal myocardial infarction by 36% (P=0.001) Coronary revascularization by 30% (P=0.016). These results were seen in combination therapy with beta blockers, and were found to be safe and effective in improving coronary artery disease outcomes in patients with heart rates of 70 bpm or more. The SIGNIFY trial randomised 19102 patients with stable coronary artery disease and an elevated heart rate greater than 70 beats per minute were assigned to an intervention of ivabradine or placebo in addition to standard therapy. Ivabradine did not significantly improve the secondary outcomes in patient groups, however did demonstrate a reduction in heart rate. When compared to the SHIFT study, a reduction in cardiovascular death or hospital admission was also demonstrated and hence should be considered when additional therapy is in question. === Chronic heart failure === In the SHIFT study, ivabradine significantly reduced the risk of the primary composite endpoint of hospitalization for worsening heart failure or cardiovascular death by 18% (P<0.0001) compared with placebo on top of optimal therapy. These benefits were observed after 3 months of treatment. SHIFT also showed that administration of ivabradine to heart failure patients significantly reduced the risk of death from heart failure by 26% (P=0.014) and hospitalization for heart failure by 26% (P<0.0001). The improvements in outcomes were observed throughout all prespecified subgroups: female and male, with or without beta-blockers at randomization, patients below and over 65 years of age, with heart failure of ischemic or non-ischemic etiology, NYHA class II or class III, IV, with or without diabetes, and with or without hypertension. A 2020 Cochrane review found no difference in cardiovascular mortality and serious adverse events between long-term treatment with ivabradine and placebo/usual care/no treatment in participants with heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction. A note of caution must be emphasised. Ivabradine, though indicated for chronic heart failure in patients who are clinically stable, is not indicated in acute heart failure where the enhanced heart rate represents cardiac reserve. Indiscriminate use of Ivabradine could destabilise these patients. == Society and culture == === Approval === Ivabradine was approved by the European Medicines Agency in 2005, and by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 2015. === Alleged conflict of interest === According to a documentary and article of the Danish media channel TV2 in September 2024, a former president of the European Society of Cardiology during 2006-2008, professor Kim Fox, had a conflict of interest in relation to clinical trials of ivabradine and his recommendation of ivabradine based on the trials. According to TV2, Fox and his partner founded a company, Heart Research Ltd., which performed clinical trials and received payments from the pharmaceutical industry, allowing them to extract a total profit of 500 million DKK (67 million euro) during 2003-2015, mostly from a cooperation with the French pharmaceutical company Servier. According to TV2's research of financial statements of the company, in the period of 2004-2006, the couple received a salary of over 20 million DKK (2.7 million euro) from their company, while during the same period, Kim Fox was chairman of the taskforce recommending ivabradine, and as president of the European Society of Cardiology, he also had the role of presenting the research results and recommending ivabradin as a \"gold standard\" treatment at a European cardiological conference in 2008. Karsten Juhl Jørgensen, professor of medicine and conflict of interests expert at Odense University and the Nordic Cochrane Centre, commented that the conflict of interest was \"probably the largest he had seen\". Danish chief physician Niels Holmark Andersen commented that Fox's conflict of interest was of an \"oligarchal magnitude\" and \"the mother of all conflicts of interests\" because Fox was involved in all parts of the process, that the clinical results did not sustain claims of the superiority of the medication which has serious adverse effect, and further that Servier had marketed ivabradine \"aggressively\" and offered physicians exclusive trips to castles in France to promote the medication during the decade of 2000-2010. === Names === It is marketed by Amgen under the brand name Corlanor in the United States, and by Servier in the rest of the world under the brand names Procoralan (worldwide), Coralan (in Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia and some other countries), Corlentor (in Armenia, Spain, Italy and Romania), Lancora (in Canada) and Coraxan (in Russia and Serbia). It is also marketed in India under the brand names Ivabrad, Ivabid. In Iran it's sold under the brand name \"bradix\" . IVAMAC and Bradia. During its development, ivabradine was known as S-16257. == References == == External links ==",

Clodronic acid is also used in experimental medicine to selectively deplete macrophages. Clodronic acid is approved for human use in Canada and Australia, the United Kingdom, where it is marketed as Bonefos, Loron, Clodron and in Italy as Clasteon, Difosfonal, Osteostab and several generics. In other countries is prescribed as a bone resorption inhibitor and antihypercalcemic agent. It is not approved for use in the United States, because it has too many adverse effects. == Veterinary uses == Clodronic acid is approved for use in horses under the trade name Osphos, for treatment of bone resorptive processes of navicular syndrome. It is given by intramuscular injection at one point in time, with the total dose divided into 2-3 sites on the horse. Clinical effects (e.g. improvement of lameness) after a single treatment can be seen up to 6 months post-treatment. === Adverse effects === Clodronic acid has been shown to have several adverse effects.

Initial Phase IIa exploratory clinical trials have been successful in patients with quiescent Crohn's disease.

In 2019, a study showed that Olorinab reduces Visceral Hypersensitivity in the TNBS-induced colitis animal model, attempting to control for its mechanism of action by using a CB2 antagonist (SR-144,528). Results were favorable showing reduced visceral hypersensitivity in animal models of IBD and IBS but not in healthy controls, suggesting that activation of CB2 causes antinociceptive actions in visceral sensory pathways in models of IBD and IBS. Also, SR-144528 prevented olorinab-induced inhibition of colonic nociceptor hypersensitivity, further validating the role of the CB2 receptor in nociception. == See also == MDMB-FUBINACA (similar structure but agonist at both CB1 and CB2 receptors) NESS-040C5 Tedalinab == References ==",

         "Spiramycin is a macrolide antibiotic and antiparasitic. It is used to treat toxoplasmosis and various other infections of soft tissues. Although used in Europe, Canada and Mexico, spiramycin is still considered an experimental drug in the United States, but can sometimes be obtained by special permission from the FDA for toxoplasmosis in the first trimester of pregnancy. Spiramycin has been used in Europe since the year 2000 under the trade name \"Rovamycine\", produced by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, Sanofi and Famar Lyon, France and Eczacıbaşı İlaç, Turkey. It also goes under the name Rovamycine in Canada (distributed by OdanLaboratories), where it is mostly marketed to dentists for mouth infections. Spiramycin has been studied as a virulence inhibitor in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. == Medical uses == === Available forms === It is available for parenteral and oral administration. Another treatment option (typically used after 16w gestation) are a combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine (given with leucovorin). == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === The antibiotic action involves inhibition of protein synthesis in the bacterial cell during translocation. Resistance to spiramycin can develop by several mechanisms and its prevalence is to a considerable extent proportional to the frequency of prescription in a given area. The antibacterial spectrum comprises Gram-positive cocci and rods, Gram-negative cocci and also Legionellae, mycoplasmas, chlamydiae, some types of spirochetes, Toxoplasma gondii and Cryptosporidium species. Enterobacteria, pseudomonads and pathogenic moulds are resistant. Its action is mainly bacteriostatic, on highly sensitive strains it exerts a bactericide action. As compared with erythromycin, it is in vitro weight for weight 5 to 20 less effective, an equipotential therapeutic dose is, however, only double. This difference between the effectiveness in vitro and in vivo is explained above all by the great affinity of spiramycin to tissues where it achieves concentrations many times higher than serum levels. An important part is played also by the slow release of the antibiotic from the tissue compartment, the marked action on microbes in sub-inhibition concentrations and the relatively long persisting post-antibiotic effect. Its great advantage is the exceptionally favourable tolerance-gastrointestinal and general. == Chemistry == Spiramycin is a 16-membered ring macrolide. == History == It was isolated in 1954 as a product of Streptomyces ambofaciens by PINNERT-SINDICO. As a preparation for oral administration it has been used since 1955, in 1987 also the parenteral form was introduced into practice. == References ==",

         "Succimer, sold under the brand name Chemet among others, is a medication tool used to treat lead, mercury, and arsenic poisoning. When it's radiolabeled with technetium-99m, it's used in many types of diagnostic testing. A full course of Succimer lasts for 19 days of oral administration. A second course should be given when more than two weeks pass after the first course. Common side effects include vomiting, diarrhea, rash, and low blood neutrophil levels. Liver problems and allergic reactions may also occur with use. Whether use during pregnancy is safe for the baby is unclear. Dimercaptosuccinic acid is in the chelating agent family of medications. It works by binding with lead and a number of other heavy metals, allowing them to leave the body in the urine. Succimer has been used medically since the 1950s. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In the United States, no generic version was available as of 2015. == Medical uses == Succimer is indicated for the treatment of lead poisoning in children with blood level measured above 45 μg/dL. The use of dimercaptosuccinic acid is not approved for prevention of lead poisoning in anticipation of exposure in known lead-contaminated environments. Dimercaptosuccinic acid can cross the blood–brain barrier of mice, but it is not known if this is also the case in humans. Even if dimercaptosuccinic acid cannot reverse the damages done to the central nervous system, it might prevent further deterioration. Succimer facilitates urinary excretion of lead, and with sufficiently aggressive treatment, can reduce lead content in the brain. It also increases urinary excretion of copper and zinc. Dimercaptosuccinic acid improved cognitive function in rats that had been exposed to lead, but reduced cognitive function in rats that had not been exposed to lead. == Chemistry == Succimer is an isomer of 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid. 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid is the organosulfur compound with the formula HO2CCH(SH)CH(SH)CO2H. This colorless solid contains two carboxylic acid and two thiol groups, the latter being responsible for its mildly unpleasant odour. It occurs in two diastereomers, meso and the chiral dl forms. The 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid molecule has two stereocentres (two asymmetric carbon atoms), and can exist as three different stereoisomers. The 2S,3S and 2R,3R isomers are a pair of enantiomers, whereas the 2R,3S isomer (succimer) is a meso compound and thus optically inactive. == Preparation and reactivity == Dimercaptosuccinic acid may be prepared by reacting acetylenedicarboxylic acid with sodium thiosulfate or thioacetic acid followed by hydrolysis. The dimethyl ester is also known. Meso 2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid binds to \"soft\" heavy metals such as Hg2+ and Pb2+, mobilizing these ions for excretion. It binds to metal cations through the thiol groups, which ionize upon complexation. == History == Dimercaptosuccinic acid was first synthesized by V. L. Nirenburg in the Urals Polytechnic Institute, commissioned by one of the electrical enterprises of Sverdlovsk, Russia, which consumed many tons of mercury and was looking for a medicine to prevent poisoning of personnel. In 1957, Chinese scientists found that dimercaptosuccinic acid can effectively treat antimony poisoning due to overdose of tartar emetic. Pronounced protective effect in animal poisoning with arsenic and mercury was first shown by I. E. Okonishnikova in 1962. In 1984, the now-defunct Bock Pharmaceutical Company requested the FDA grant approval for orphan drug status under the brand name Chemet and the FDA approved of this in 1991. It provided exclusivity until 1998 which was conveyed to the successor Sanofi in 1996. == References == == Further reading ==",

         "Valsartan, sold under the brand name Diovan among others, is a medication used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and diabetic kidney disease. It belongs to a class of medications referred to as angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). It is a reasonable initial treatment for high blood pressure. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include feeling tired, dizziness, high blood potassium, diarrhea, and joint pain. Other serious side effects may include kidney problems, low blood pressure, and angioedema. Use in pregnancy may harm the baby and use when breastfeeding is not recommended. It is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist and works by blocking the effects of angiotensin II. Valsartan was patented in 1990, and came into medical use in 1996. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 117th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Valsartan is used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and to reduce death for people with left ventricular dysfunction after having a heart attack. === High blood pressure === Valsartan (and other ARBs) are an appropriate initial treatment option for most people with high blood pressure and no other coexisting conditions, as are ACE inhibitors, thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers. If patients have coexisting diabetes or kidney disease, ARBs or ACE inhibitors may be considered over other classes of blood pressure medicines. === Heart failure === Valsartan has reduced rates of mortality and heart failure hospitalisations when used alone or in combination with beta blockers in the treatment of heart failure. Importantly, the combination of valsartan and ACE inhibitors has not shown morbidity or mortality benefits but rather increases mortality risk when added to combination beta blocker and ACE inhibitor therapy, and increases the risk of adverse events like hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal failure. As shown in the PARADIGM-HF study, valsartan combined with sacubitril for the treatment of heart failure, significantly reduced all cause and cardiovascular mortality and hospitalisations due to heart failure. === Diabetic kidney disease === In people with type 2 diabetes, antihypertensive therapy with valsartan decreases the rate of progression of albuminuria (albumin in urine), promotes regression to normoalbuminuria and may reduce the rate of progression to end-stage kidney disease. == Contraindications == The packaging for valsartan includes a warning stating the drug should not be used with the renin inhibitor aliskiren in people with diabetes. It also states the safety of the drug in severe renal impairment has not been established. Valsartan includes a black box warning for fetal toxicity. Discontinuation of these agents is recommended immediately after detection of pregnancy and an alternative medication should be started. Breastfeeding is not recommended. == Side effects == Side effects depend on the reason the medication is being used. === Heart failure === Adverse effects are based on a comparison versus placebo in people with heart failure. Most common side effects include dizziness (17% vs 9% ), low blood pressure (7% vs 2%), and diarrhea (5% vs 4%). Less common side effects include joint pain, fatigue, and back pain (all 3% vs 2%). === Hypertension === Clinical trials for valsartan treatment for hypertension versus placebo demonstrate side effects like viral infection (3% vs 2%), fatigue (2% vs 1%) and abdominal pain (2% vs 1%). Minor side effects that occurred at >1% but were similar to rates from the placebo group include: headache dizziness upper respiratory infection cough diarrhea rhinitis/sinusitis nausea pharyngitis edema arthralgia === Kidney failure === People treated with ARBs including valsartan or diuretics are susceptible to conditions of developing low renal blood flow such as abnormal narrowing of blood vessels in the kidney, hypertension, renal artery stenosis, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion whose renal function is in part dependent on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system like efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction done by angiotensin II are at high risk of deterioration of renal function comprising acute kidney failure, oliguria, worsening azotemia or heightened serum creatinine. When blood flow to the kidneys is reduced, the kidney activates a series of responses that triggers angiotensin release to constrict blood vessels and facilitate blood flow in the kidney. So long as the nephron function degradation is progressive or reaches clinically significant levels, withholding or discontinuing valsartan is warranted. == Interactions == The US prescribing information lists the following drug interactions for valsartan: Other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system may increase the risks of low blood pressure, kidney problems, and hyperkalemia. Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium may increase the risk of hyperkalemia. NSAIDs may increase the risk of kidney problems and may interfere with blood pressure-lowering effects. Valsartan may increase the concentration of lithium. Valsartan and other angiotensin-related blood pressure medications may interact with the antibiotics co-trimoxazole or ciprofloxacin to increase risk of sudden death due to cardiac arrest. === Food interaction === With the tablet, food decreases the valsartan tablet taker's exposure to valsartan by about 40% and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50%, evidenced by AUC change. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Valsartan blocks the actions of angiotensin II, which include constricting blood vessels and activating aldosterone, to reduce blood pressure. The drug binds to angiotensin type I receptors (AT1), working as an antagonist. This mechanism of action is different than that of the ACE inhibitor drugs, which block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. As valsartan acts at the receptor, it can provide more complete angiotensin II antagonism since angiotensin II is generated by other enzymes as well as ACE. Also, valsartan does not affect the metabolism of bradykinin like ACE inhibitors do. === Pharmacodynamics === === Pharmacokinetics === The peak concentration of valsartan in plasma occurs 2 to 4 hours after dosing. AUC and Cmax values of valsartan are observed to be approximately linearly dose-dependent over therapeutic dosing range. Owing to its relatively short elimination half life attribution, valsartan concentration in plasma does not accumulate in response to repeated dosing. == Society and culture == === Economics === In 2010, valsartan (trade name Diovan) achieved annual sales of $2.052 billion in the United States and $6.053 billion worldwide. The patents for valsartan and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide expired in September 2012. === Combinations === Versions are available as the combinations valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/amlodipine, valsartan/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/nebivolol, and valsartan/sacubitril. Valsartan is combined with amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) (or both) into single-pill formulations for treating hypertension with multiple drugs. Valsartan is also available as the combination valsartan/sacubitril. It is used to treat heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. === Recalls === In July 2018, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recalled certain batches of valsartan and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide film-coated tablets distributed in 22 countries in the European Union. Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical Co. (ZHP) in Linhai, China manufactured the bulk ingredient contaminated by N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a carcinogen. The active pharmaceutical ingredient was subsequently imported by a number of generic drugmakers, including Novartis, and marketed in Europe and Asia under their subsidiary Sandoz labeling, and in the UK by Dexcel Pharma Ltd and Accord Healthcare. Valsartan was recalled in Canada. Authorities believe the degree of contamination is negligible. In July 2018, The National Agency of Drug and Food Control (NA-DFC or Badan POM Indonesia) announced voluntary recalls for two products containing valsartan produced by Actavis Indonesia and Dipa Pharmalab Intersains. In July 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced voluntary recalls of certain supplies of valsartan and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide in the US distributed by Solco Healthcare LLC, Major Pharmaceuticals, and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. Hong Kong's Department of Health initiated a similar recall. In August 2018, the FDA published two lengthy, updated lists, classifying hundreds of specific US products containing valsartan into those included versus excluded from the recall. A week later, the FDA cited two more drugmakers, Zhejiang Tianyu Pharmaceuticals of China and Hetero Labs Limited of India, as additional sources of the contaminated valsartan ingredient. In September 2018, the FDA announced that retesting of all valsartan supplies had found a second carcinogenic impurity, N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), in the recalled products made by ZHP in China and marketed in the US under the Torrent Pharmaceuticals (India) brand. According to a 2018 Reuters analysis of national medicines agencies' records, more than 50 companies around the world have recalled valsartan mono-preparations or combination products manufactured from the tainted valsartan ingredient. The contamination has likely been present since 2012 when the manufacturing process was changed and approved by EDQM and FDA authorities. Based on inspections in late 2018, both agencies have suspended the Chinese and Indian manufacturers' certificates of suitability for the supply of valsartan in the EU and the US. In 2019, many more preparations of valsartan and its combinations were recalled due to the presence of the contaminant NDMA. In August 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) provided guidance to marketing authorization holders on how to avoid the presence of nitrosamine impurities in human medicines and asked them to review all chemical and biological human medicines for the possible presence of nitrosamines and to test the products at risk. The FDA issued revised guidelines about nitrosamine impurities in September 2024. === Shortages === Since July 2018, numerous recalls of losartan, valsartan and irbesartan drug products have caused marked shortages of these life saving medications in North America and Europe, particularly for valsartan. In March 2019, the FDA approved an additional generic version of valsartan to address the issue. According to the agency, the shortage of valsartan was resolved in April 2020, but the availability of the generic form remained unstable into July 2020. Pharmacies in the European Union were notified that the supply of the drug, particularly for higher dosage forms, would remain unstable well into December 2020. == Research == In people with impaired glucose tolerance, valsartan may decrease the incidence of developing diabetes mellitus type 2. However, the absolute risk reduction is small (less than 1 percent per year) and diet, exercise or other drugs, may be more protective. In the same study, no reduction in the rate of cardiovascular events (including death) was shown. In one study of people without diabetes, valsartan reduced the risk of developing diabetes mellitus over amlodipine, mainly for those with hypertension. A prospective study demonstrated a reduction in the incidence and progression of Alzheimer's disease and dementia. == References ==",

         " This study was designed to analyse the effects of the novel, orally bioavailable CDK9-inhibitor Atuveciclib (BAY 1143572) in combination with tumour necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) on pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) cancer cells. To assess the effect of combinatorial use of atuveciclib and TRAIL on pancreatic cancer cells, we used an MTT assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, and western blot analysis. Atuveciclib combined with TRAIL significantly reduced the viability of pancreatic cancer cells and their colony formation potential by inducing apoptosis and cell-cycle arrest. Atuveciclib sensitised PDAC cells to TRAIL-induced cell death through the concomitant suppression of cFlip and Mcl-1. A gemcitabine-resistant PDAC cell-line and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) cell lines were also suppressed by this combinatorial approach. This study provides the basis for further preclinical and clinical evaluation of combined treatment with atuveciclib and TRAIL. Psoriasis is a chronic, autoimmune skin disease characterized by the deregulated secretion of inflammatory factors in multiple organs. The aberrant activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling pathway mediated by cyclin-dependent kinase 9 (CDK9) is vital for the pathology of psoriasis, leading to the accumulation of inflammatory factors and the progression of skin damage. In this study, we explored the effect of CDK9 inhibition on attenuating the secretion of inflammatory factors and alleviating skin damage in psoriasis models both in vitro and in vivo. Results showed that Atuveciclib, a highly selective CDK9 inhibitor, significantly relieved skin lesions in Imiquimod (IMQ)-induced mice models by lowering the expression of CDK9 and p-RNA Pol II  Selective inhibition of exclusively transcription-regulating PTEFb/CDK9 is a promising new approach in cancer therapy. Starting from lead compound BAY-958, lead optimization efforts strictly focusing on kinase selectivity, physicochemical and DMPK properties finally led to the identification of the orally available clinical candidate atuveciclib (BAY 1143572). Structurally characterized by an unusual benzyl sulfoximine group, BAY 1143572 exhibited the best overall profile in vitro and in vivo, including high efficacy and good tolerability in xenograft models in mice and rats. BAY 1143572 is the first potent and highly selective PTEFb/CDK9 inhibitor to enter clinical trials for the treatment of cancer.",

         "Medical",
         "Binimetinib, sold under the brand name Mektovi, is an anti-cancer medication used to treat various cancers. Binimetinib is a selective inhibitor of MEK, a central kinase in the tumor-promoting MAPK pathway. Inappropriate activation of the pathway has been shown to occur in many cancers. In June 2018 it was approved by the FDA in combination with encorafenib for the treatment of patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600E or V600K mutation-positive melanoma. In October 2023, it was approved by the FDA for treatment of NSCLC with a BRAF V600E mutation in combination with encorafenib. It was developed by Array Biopharma. == Mechanism of action == Binimetinib is an orally available inhibitor of mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK), or more specifically, a MAP2K inhibitor. MEK is part of the RAS pathway, which is involved in cell proliferation and survival. MEK is upregulated in many forms of cancer. Binimetinib, uncompetitive with ATP, binds to and inhibits the activity of MEK1/2 kinase, which has been shown to regulate several key cellular activities including proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. MEK1/2 are dual-specificity threonine/tyrosine kinases that play key roles in the activation of the RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway and are often upregulated in a variety of tumor cell types. Inhibition of MEK1/2 prevents the activation of MEK1/2 dependent effector proteins and transcription factors, which may result in the inhibition of growth factor-mediated cell signaling. As demonstrated in preclinical studies, this may eventually lead to an inhibition of tumor cell proliferation and an inhibition in production of various inflammatory cytokines including interleukin-1, -6 and tumor necrosis factor. == Development == In 2015, it was in phase III clinical trials for ovarian cancer, BRAF mutant melanoma, and NRAS Q61 mutant melanoma. In December 2015, the company announced that the mutant-NRAS melanoma trial was successful. In the trial, those receiving binimetinib had a median progression-free survival of 2.8 months versus 1.5 months for those on the standard dacarbazine treatment. NDA submitted Jun 2016, and the FDA should decide by 30 June 2017. In April 2016, it was reported that the phase III trial for low-grade ovarian cancer was terminated due to lack of efficacy. In 2017, the FDA informed Array Biopharma that the phase III trial data was not sufficient and the New Drug Application was withdrawn. In June 2018, it was approved for the treatment of certain melanomas by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in combination with encorafenib. The FDA approved binimetinib based primarily on evidence from one clinical trial (NCT01909453) of 383 patients with BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma that was advanced or could not be removed by surgery. The trial was conducted at 162 sites in Europe, North America, and various countries around the world. In October 2023, the US Food and Drug Administration approved encorafenib with binimetinib for adults with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with a BRAF V600E mutation, as detected by an FDA-approved test. == References == == External links ==",

         "Medical",
         "Donepezil, sold under the brand name Aricept among others, is a medication used to treat dementia of the Alzheimer's type. It appears to result in a small benefit in mental function and ability to function. Use, however, has not been shown to change the progression of the disease. Treatment should be stopped if no benefit is seen. It is taken by mouth or via a transdermal patch. Donepezil is a centrally acting reversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor and structurally unrelated to other anticholinesterase agents. Common side effects include nausea, trouble sleeping, aggression, diarrhea, feeling tired, and muscle cramps. Serious side effects may include abnormal heart rhythms, urinary incontinence, and seizures. Donepezil was approved for medical use in the United States in 1996. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 146th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Alzheimer's disease === There is no evidence that donepezil or other similar agents alter the course or progression of Alzheimer's disease. Six-to-twelve-month controlled studies have shown modest benefits in cognition or behavior. The UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommends donepezil as an option in the management of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. The person should, however, be reviewed frequently and if there is no significant benefit it should be stopped. In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also approved donepezil for treatment of mild, moderate and severe dementia in Alzheimer's disease. === Other === Lewy body dementia: Some studies have shown benefits of donepezil for the treatment of cognitive and behavioral symptoms in Lewy body dementia. Traumatic brain injury: Some research suggests an improvement in memory dysfunction in patients with traumatic brain injury with donepezil use. Vascular dementia: Studies have shown that donepezil may improve cognition in patients with vascular dementia but not overall global functioning. Dementia associated with Parkinson disease: Some evidence suggests that donepezil can improve cognition, executive function, and global status in Parkinson disease dementia. == Adverse effects == In clinical trials the most common adverse events leading to discontinuation were nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting. Other side effects included difficulty sleeping, muscle cramps and loss of appetite. Most side effects were observed in patients taking the 23 mg dose compared to 10 mg or lower doses. Side effects are mild and transient in most patients, lasting up to three weeks and usually improved even with continued use. Donepezil, like other cholinesterase inhibitors, can cause nightmares due to enhanced activation of the visual association cortex during REM sleep. Dosing donepezil in the morning can reduce the frequency of nightmares. === Precautions === Donepezil should be used with caution in people with heart disease, cardiac conduction disturbances, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, severe cardiac arrhythmia and sick sinus syndrome. People with peptic ulcer disease or taking NSAIDs should use with caution because increased risk of gastrointestinal bleeding was noted. Slow heart beat and fainting in people with heart problems were also seen. These symptoms may appear more frequent when initiating treatment or increasing the donepezil dose. Although occurrence of seizures is rare, people who have a predisposition to seizures should be treated with caution. If daily donepezil has suspended for 7 days or less, restarting at the same dose is recommended, while if the suspension lasts longer than 7 days, retitrate from 5 mg daily is suggested. == Mechanism of action == Donepezil binds and reversibly inhibits enzymes called cholinesterases, especially acetylcholinesterase, thus inhibiting hydrolysis of acetylcholine. This increases acetylcholine concentrations at cholinergic synapses. The precise mechanism of action of donepezil in patients with Alzheimer's disease is not fully understood. Certainly, Alzheimer's disease involves a substantial loss of the elements of the cholinergic system and it is generally accepted that the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease are related to this cholinergic deficit, particularly in the cerebral cortex and other areas of the brain. In addition to its actions as an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, donepezil has been found to act as a potent agonist of the σ1 receptor (Ki = 14.6 nM), and has been shown to produce specific antiamnestic effects in animals mainly via this action. Some noncholinergic mechanisms have also been proposed. Donepezil upregulates the nicotinic receptors in the cortical neurons, adding to neuroprotective activity. It inhibits voltage-activated sodium currents reversibly and delays rectifier potassium currents and fast transient potassium currents, although this action is unlikely to contribute to clinical effects. == Synergy == Donepezil was claimed to act synergistically with an agent called FK962 [283167-06-6] & FK960 [133920-70-4]. {potential activation of somatostatinergic neurotransmission} However, the development was discontinued after Phase II \"since the data reviewed did not indicate clear efficacy of the compound for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.\" == Stereochemistry == Donepezil medications are racemates. == History == Research leading to the development of donepezil began in 1983, at Eisai, and in 1996, Eisai received approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for donepezil under the brand Aricept, which it co-marketed with Pfizer. The team at Eisai was led by Hachiro Sugimoto. As of 2011, Aricept was the world's best-selling Alzheimer's disease treatment. The first generic donepezil became available in November 2010, with the US FDA approval of a formulation prepared by Ranbaxy Labs. == Research == Donepezil has been tested in other cognitive disorders, including Lewy body dementia, and vascular dementia, but it is not currently approved for these indications. Donepezil has also been found to improve sleep apnea in people with Alzheimer's. It also improves gait in people with mild Alzheimer's. Donepezil has also been studied in people with mild cognitive impairment, schizophrenia, attention deficit disorder, post-coronary artery bypass surgery cognitive impairment, cognitive impairment associated with multiple sclerosis, CADASIL syndrome, and Down syndrome. A three-year National Institutes of Health trial in people with mild cognitive impairment reported donepezil was superior to placebo in delaying rate of progression to dementia during the initial 18 months of the study, but this was not sustained at 36 months. In a secondary analysis, a subgroup of individuals with the apolipoprotein E4 genotype showed sustained benefits with donepezil throughout the study. At this time, though, donepezil is not indicated for prevention of dementia. === Cognitive enhancement === Donepezil has shown mixed results for improving cognitive abilities in healthy individuals. A 2009 double-blind, placebo controlled study (n=24) investigating donepezil's effects across a variety of memory tests in reported an improvement in spatial memory accuracy both before (90 minutes after dosing) and at theoretical Tmax (210 minutes after dosing). However, a later 2011 paper featuring two study double-blind, placebo controlled experiments evaluating donepezil's effects in older but healthy subjects reported impairment after acute (5 hours after dose) and chronic (4 weeks) donepezil administration. === ADHD === The addition of donepezil with existing ADHD medications has shown mixed results. In those with Tourette syndrome and ADHD, donepezil may reduce tics while it had no effect on ADHD's symptoms. === Pervasive developmental disorder === Donepezil, along with other cholinesterase inhibitors, is suggested as having potential for trouble behaviors: irritability, hyperactivity, and difficulty in social communication which are typically seen in those with pervasive developmental disorder, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified, and autism-spectrum disorder. === Anorexia nervosa === Donepezil is furthermore suggested as a feasible therapeutic option for anorexia nervosa. Emerging literature reports that a subset of patients suffering from restrictive anorexia nervosa have enhanced habit formation compared with healthy controls. Habit formation is modulated by striatal cholinergic interneurons. Based on the physiopathology of anorexia nervosa, namely in terms of cholinergic deficiencies, the effects of donepezil and other drugs that act as cholinesterase inhibitors could thus be effective in the treatment of the disorder. However, no trial to date supports this hypothesis. == References == == Further reading == Brenner GD, Brenner GM (2000). Pharmacology. Philadelphia: W. B. Saunders. ISBN 978-0-7216-7757-6.

         "Endogenous, Food, Medical",
         "Equol (4',7-isoflavandiol) is an isoflavandiol estrogen metabolized from daidzein, a type of isoflavone found in soybeans and other plant sources, by bacterial flora in the intestines. While endogenous estrogenic hormones such as estradiol are steroids, equol is a nonsteroidal estrogen. Only about 30–50% of people have intestinal bacteria that make equol. == History == (S)-Equol was first isolated from horse urine in 1932, and the name was suggested by this equine connection. Since then, equol has been found in the urine or plasma of many other animal species, although these animals have significant differences in their ability to metabolize daidzein into equol. In 1980, scientists reported the discovery of equol in humans. The ability of (S)-equol to play a role in the treatment of estrogen- or androgen-mediated diseases or disorders was first proposed in 1984. == Chemical structure == Equol is a compound that can exist in two mirror-image forms known as enantiomers: (S)-equol and (R)-equol. (S)-equol is produced in humans and animals with the ability to metabolize the soy isoflavone daidzein, while (R)-equol can be chemically synthesized. The molecular and physical structure of (S)-equol is similar to that of the hormone estradiol. (S)-Equol preferentially binds estrogen receptor beta. == Pharmacology == === Estrogen receptor binding === (S)-equol is a nonsteroidal, selective agonist of ERβ (Ki = 16 nM) with 13-fold selectivity for ERβ over ERα. Relative to (S)-equol, (R)-equol is less potent and binds to ERα (Ki = 50 nM) with 3.5-fold selectivity over ERβ. (S)-Equol has about 2% of estradiol's binding affinity for human estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and 20% of estradiol's binding affinity for human estrogen receptor beta (ERβ). The preferential binding of (S)-equol to ERβ vs. ERα and in comparison to that of estradiol suggests the molecule may share some of the characteristics of a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Equol has been found to act as an agonist of the GPER (GPR30). === Pharmacokinetics === (S)-Equol is a very stable molecule that essentially remains unchanged when digested, and this lack of further metabolism explains its very quick absorption and high bioavailability. When (S)-equol is consumed, it is rapidly absorbed and achieves a Tmax (rate of peak plasma concentration) in two to three hours. In comparison, the Tmax of daidzein is 4 to 10 hours because daidzein exists in glycoside (with a glucose side chain) form. The body must convert daidzein to its aglycone form (without the glucose side chain) via removal of the sugar side chain during digestion before it can use daidzein. If consumed directly in aglycone form, daidzein has a Tmax of one to three hours. The percent fractional elimination of (S)-equol in urine after oral administration is high and in some adults can reach close to 100 percent. The percent fractional elimination of daidzein is much lower at 30 to 40 percent. == Production in humans == To produce (S)-equol after soy consumption, humans must have certain strains of bacteria living within their intestines. Twenty-one different strains of intestinal bacteria cultured from humans have been shown to have the ability to transform daidzein into (S)-equol or a related intermediate compound. Several studies indicate that only 25 to 30 percent of the adult populations of Western countries produce (S)-equol after eating soy foods containing isoflavones, while 50 to 60 percent of adults from Japan, Korea, and China are equol-producers. Vegetarians have also been reported to be more capable of transforming daidzein into (S)-equol. Seaweed and dairy consumption can enhance the production of equol. The ability of a person to produce (S)-equol is determined by testing people who have not taken any antibiotics for at least a month. For this standardized test, the individual drinks two 240 milliliter glasses of soy milk or eats a soy food equivalent for three days. The (S)-equol concentration in each test subject's urine is determined on day four. === Equol producing bacteria === While many more bacteria are involved in the related intermediate process of equol production, such as conversion of daidzin to daidzein, or genistein to 5-Hydroxy-equol, the bacteria that achieve the complete conversion of daidzein to (S)-equol, include: Adlercreutzia equolifaciens Asaccharobacter celatus AHU1763 Bacteroides ovatus Bifidobacterium Bifidobacterium animalis Coriobacteriaceae sp MT1B9 Eggerthella sp YY7918 Enterococcus faecium Eubacterium sp D1 and D2 Finegoldia magna Lactobacillus mucosae Lactobacillus sp Niu-O16 Lactococcus garvieae (Lc 20-92) Ruminococcus productus Slackia sp HE8 Slackia equolifaciens (Strain DZE) Streptococcus intermedius Veillonella sp Conversion by Bifidobacterium has only been reported once by Tsangalis et al. in 2002 and not reproduced since.Bifidobacteria: Genomics and Molecular Aspects Mixed cultures such as Lactobacillus sp. Niu-O16 and Eggerthella sp. Julong 732 can also produce (S)-equol.Bifidobacteria: Genomics and Molecular Aspects Some equol producing bacteria, as implied by their nomenclature, are Adlercreutzia equolifaciens, Slackia equolifaciens and Slackia isoflavoniconvertens. == Health effects == === Skin health === The topical effects of equol as an anti-aging substance have been shown in different studies. The effects result from both molecular and structural changes to the skin. Equol can, for instance, lead to an increase in telomere length. As an antioxidant, equol can decrease the aging process by reducing damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). It may also act as a protective anti-photoaging substance by inhibiting acute UVA- induced lipid peroxidation. In addition, equol may have a positive impact on epigenetic regulation. Equol's phytoestrogenic properties may also affect skin health. Reduction of dark circles and eye wrinkles after treatment with equol has been reported. Equol may also protect skin from damage by pollution due to its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Each of the enantiomers and the racemic mixture of both enantiomers have different characteristics, bioavailabilities and molecular effects. According to one study, (RS)-equol provided the greatest overall improvement in skin health, especially when applied topically. === Hormone-related health effects === Beyond topical effects, medicinal equol has been shown to relieve menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and muscle and joint pain. (RS)-equol was also reported to reduce symptoms associated with menopausal vaginal atrophy, such as vaginal itching, vaginal dryness and pain with intercourse and cause positive shifts in the vaginal bacterial population, cell composition, and pH. According to animal studies, it has anti-androgenic effects and may lead to inhibited 5-alpha reductase as well as lowered dihydrotestosterone (DHT) levels. == See also == Daidzein Estrogen receptor Genistein Liquiritigenin Menerba Prinaberel WAY-200070 Diarylpropionitrile == References ==",

         "Endogenous, Food, Medical",
         "Equol (4',7-isoflavandiol) is an isoflavandiol estrogen metabolized from daidzein, a type of isoflavone found in soybeans and other plant sources, by bacterial flora in the intestines. While endogenous estrogenic hormones such as estradiol are steroids, equol is a nonsteroidal estrogen. Only about 30–50% of people have intestinal bacteria that make equol. == History == (S)-Equol was first isolated from horse urine in 1932, and the name was suggested by this equine connection. Since then, equol has been found in the urine or plasma of many other animal species, although these animals have significant differences in their ability to metabolize daidzein into equol. In 1980, scientists reported the discovery of equol in humans. The ability of (S)-equol to play a role in the treatment of estrogen- or androgen-mediated diseases or disorders was first proposed in 1984. == Chemical structure == Equol is a compound that can exist in two mirror-image forms known as enantiomers: (S)-equol and (R)-equol. (S)-equol is produced in humans and animals with the ability to metabolize the soy isoflavone daidzein, while (R)-equol can be chemically synthesized. The molecular and physical structure of (S)-equol is similar to that of the hormone estradiol. (S)-Equol preferentially binds estrogen receptor beta. == Pharmacology == === Estrogen receptor binding === (S)-equol is a nonsteroidal, selective agonist of ERβ (Ki = 16 nM) with 13-fold selectivity for ERβ over ERα. Relative to (S)-equol, (R)-equol is less potent and binds to ERα (Ki = 50 nM) with 3.5-fold selectivity over ERβ. (S)-Equol has about 2% of estradiol's binding affinity for human estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) and 20% of estradiol's binding affinity for human estrogen receptor beta (ERβ). The preferential binding of (S)-equol to ERβ vs. ERα and in comparison to that of estradiol suggests the molecule may share some of the characteristics of a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Equol has been found to act as an agonist of the GPER (GPR30). === Pharmacokinetics === (S)-Equol is a very stable molecule that essentially remains unchanged when digested, and this lack of further metabolism explains its very quick absorption and high bioavailability. When (S)-equol is consumed, it is rapidly absorbed and achieves a Tmax (rate of peak plasma concentration) in two to three hours. In comparison, the Tmax of daidzein is 4 to 10 hours because daidzein exists in glycoside (with a glucose side chain) form. The body must convert daidzein to its aglycone form (without the glucose side chain) via removal of the sugar side chain during digestion before it can use daidzein. If consumed directly in aglycone form, daidzein has a Tmax of one to three hours. The percent fractional elimination of (S)-equol in urine after oral administration is high and in some adults can reach close to 100 percent. The percent fractional elimination of daidzein is much lower at 30 to 40 percent. == Production in humans == To produce (S)-equol after soy consumption, humans must have certain strains of bacteria living within their intestines. Twenty-one different strains of intestinal bacteria cultured from humans have been shown to have the ability to transform daidzein into (S)-equol or a related intermediate compound. Several studies indicate that only 25 to 30 percent of the adult populations of Western countries produce (S)-equol after eating soy foods containing isoflavones, while 50 to 60 percent of adults from Japan, Korea, and China are equol-producers. Vegetarians have also been reported to be more capable of transforming daidzein into (S)-equol. Seaweed and dairy consumption can enhance the production of equol. The ability of a person to produce (S)-equol is determined by testing people who have not taken any antibiotics for at least a month. For this standardized test, the individual drinks two 240 milliliter glasses of soy milk or eats a soy food equivalent for three days. The (S)-equol concentration in each test subject's urine is determined on day four. === Equol producing bacteria === While many more bacteria are involved in the related intermediate process of equol production, such as conversion of daidzin to daidzein, or genistein to 5-Hydroxy-equol, the bacteria that achieve the complete conversion of daidzein to (S)-equol, include: Adlercreutzia equolifaciens Asaccharobacter celatus AHU1763 Bacteroides ovatus Bifidobacterium Bifidobacterium animalis Coriobacteriaceae sp MT1B9 Eggerthella sp YY7918 Enterococcus faecium Eubacterium sp D1 and D2 Finegoldia magna Lactobacillus mucosae Lactobacillus sp Niu-O16 Lactococcus garvieae (Lc 20-92) Ruminococcus productus Slackia sp HE8 Slackia equolifaciens (Strain DZE) Streptococcus intermedius Veillonella sp Conversion by Bifidobacterium has only been reported once by Tsangalis et al. in 2002 and not reproduced since.Bifidobacteria: Genomics and Molecular Aspects Mixed cultures such as Lactobacillus sp. Niu-O16 and Eggerthella sp. Julong 732 can also produce (S)-equol.Bifidobacteria: Genomics and Molecular Aspects Some equol producing bacteria, as implied by their nomenclature, are Adlercreutzia equolifaciens, Slackia equolifaciens and Slackia isoflavoniconvertens. == Health effects == === Skin health === The topical effects of equol as an anti-aging substance have been shown in different studies. The effects result from both molecular and structural changes to the skin. Equol can, for instance, lead to an increase in telomere length. As an antioxidant, equol can decrease the aging process by reducing damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS). It may also act as a protective anti-photoaging substance by inhibiting acute UVA- induced lipid peroxidation. In addition, equol may have a positive impact on epigenetic regulation. Equol's phytoestrogenic properties may also affect skin health. Reduction of dark circles and eye wrinkles after treatment with equol has been reported. Equol may also protect skin from damage by pollution due to its anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory properties. Each of the enantiomers and the racemic mixture of both enantiomers have different characteristics, bioavailabilities and molecular effects. According to one study, (RS)-equol provided the greatest overall improvement in skin health, especially when applied topically. === Hormone-related health effects === Beyond topical effects, medicinal equol has been shown to relieve menopausal symptoms such as hot flashes and muscle and joint pain. (RS)-equol was also reported to reduce symptoms associated with menopausal vaginal atrophy, such as vaginal itching, vaginal dryness and pain with intercourse and cause positive shifts in the vaginal bacterial population, cell composition, and pH.

         "Medical",
         "Estramustine phosphate (EMP), also known as estradiol normustine phosphate and sold under the brand names Emcyt and Estracyt, is a dual estrogen and chemotherapy medication which is used in the treatment of prostate cancer in men. It is taken multiple times a day by mouth or by injection into a vein. Side effects of EMP include nausea, vomiting, gynecomastia, feminization, demasculinization, sexual dysfunction, blood clots, and cardiovascular complications. EMP is a dual cytostatic and hence chemotherapeutic agent and a hormonal anticancer agent of the estrogen type. It is a prodrug of estramustine and estromustine in terms of its cytostatic effects and a prodrug of estradiol in relation to its estrogenic effects. EMP has strong estrogenic effects at typical clinical dosages, and consequently has marked antigonadotropic and functional antiandrogenic effects. EMP was introduced for medical use in the early 1970s. It is available in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, other European countries, and elsewhere in the world. == Medical uses == EMP is indicated, in the United States, for the palliative treatment of metastatic and/or progressive prostate cancer, whereas in the United Kingdom it is indicated for the treatment of unresponsive or relapsing prostate cancer. The medication is usually reserved for use in hormone-refractory cases of prostate cancer, although it has been used as a first-line monotherapy as well. Response rates with EMP in prostate cancer are said to be equivalent to conventional high-dose estrogen therapy. Due to its relatively severe side effects and toxicity, EMP has rarely been used in the treatment of prostate cancer. This is especially true in Western countries today. As a result, and also due to the scarce side effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormone modulators (GnRH modulators) like leuprorelin, EMP was almost abandoned. However, encouraging clinical research findings resulted in renewed interest of EMP for the treatment of prostate cancer. EMP has been used at doses of 140 to 1,400 mg/day orally in the treatment of prostate cancer. However, oral EMP is most commonly used at a dose of 560 to 640 mg/day (280–320 mg twice daily). The recommended dosage of oral EMP in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) label for Emcyt is 14 mg per kg of body weight (i.e., one 140 mg oral capsule for each 10 kg or 22 lbs of body weight) given in 3 or 4 divided doses per day. The label states that most patients in studies of oral EMP in the United States have received 10 to 16 mg per kg per day. This would be about 900 to 1,440 mg/day for a 90-kg or 200-lb man. Lower doses of oral EMP, such as 280 mg/day, have been found to have comparable effectiveness as higher doses but with improved tolerability and reduced toxicity. Doses of 140 mg/day have been described as a very low dosage. EMP has been used at doses of 240 to 450 mg/day intravenously. EMP and other estrogens such as polyestradiol phosphate and ethinylestradiol are far less costly than newer therapies such as GnRH modulators, abiraterone acetate, and enzalutamide. In addition, estrogens may offer significant benefits over other means of androgen deprivation therapy, for instance in terms of bone loss and fractures, hot flashes, cognition, and metabolic status. EMP has been used to prevent the testosterone flare at the start of GnRH agonist therapy in men with prostate cancer. === Available forms === EMP is or has been available in the form of both capsules (140 mg, 280 mg) for oral administration and aqueous solutions (300 mg) for intravenous injection. == Contraindications == EMP is contraindicated when used in children, patients hypersensitive to estrogens or nitrogen mustards, those with peptic ulcer (an ulcer in the digestive tract), those with severely compromised liver function, those with weak heart muscle (also known as myocardial insufficiency) and those with thromboembolic disorders or complications related to fluid retention. == Side effects == The side effects of EMP overall have been described as relatively severe. The most common side effects of EMP have been reported to be gastrointestinal side effects like nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, with nausea and vomiting occurring in 40% of men. They are usually mild or moderate in severity, and the nausea and vomiting can be managed with prophylactic antiemetic medications. Nonetheless, severe cases of gastrointestinal side effects with EMP may require dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy. Although nausea and vomiting have been reported to be the most common side effects of EMP, gynecomastia (male breast development) has been found to occur in as many as 83% of men treated with EMP, and the incidence of erectile dysfunction is possibly similar to or slightly less than the risk of gynecomastia. As a rule, feminization, a gynoid fat distribution, demasculinization, and impotence are said to occur in virtually or nearly 100% of men treated with high-dose estrogen therapy. Decreased sexual activity has also been reported in men treated with EMP. These side effects are due to high estrogen levels and low testosterone levels. Prophylactic irradiation of the breasts can be used to decrease the incidence and severity of gynecomastia with estrogens. Severe adverse effects of EMP are thromboembolic and cardiovascular complications including pulmonary embolism, deep vein thrombosis, stroke, thrombophlebitis, coronary artery disease (ischemic heart disease; e.g., myocardial infarction), thrombophlebitis, and congestive heart failure with fluid retention. EMP produces cardiovascular toxicity similarly to diethylstilbestrol, but to a lesser extent in comparison at low doses (e.g., 280 mg/day oral EMP vs. 1 mg/day oral diethylstilbestrol). The prostate cancer disease state also increases the risk of thromboembolism, and combination with docetaxel may exacerbate the risk of thromboembolism as well. Meta-analyses of clinical trials have found that the overall risk of thromboembolism with EMP is 4 to 7%, relative to 0.4% for chemotherapy regimens without EMP. Thromboembolism is the major toxicity-related cause of discontinuation of EMP. Anticoagulant therapy with medications such as aspirin, warfarin, unfractionated and low-molecular-weight heparin, and vitamin K antagonists can be useful for decreasing the risk of thromboembolism with EMP and other estrogens like diethylstilbestrol and ethinylestradiol. Adverse liver function tests are commonly seen with EMP, but severe liver dysfunction is rare with the medication. Central nervous system side effects are rarely seen with EMP, although enlarged ventricles and neuronal pigmentation have been reported in monkeys treated with very high doses of EMP (20–140 mg/kg/day) for 3 to 6 months. EMP does not appear to have cytostatic effects in normal brain tissue. In women treated with EMP in clinical studies, a few instances of minor gynecological hemorrhages have been observed. EMP is described as relatively well tolerated among cytostatic antineoplastic and nitrogen-mustard agents, rarely or not at all being associated with significant hematologic toxicity such as myelosuppression (bone marrow suppression), gastrointestinal toxicity, or other more marked toxicity associated with such agents. In contrast to most other cytostatic agents, which often cause myelosuppression, leukopenia (decreased white blood cell count), and neutropenia (decreased neutrophil count), EMP actually produces leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count) as a side effect. In a small low-dose study using 280 mg/day oral EMP for 150 days, tolerability was significantly improved, with gastrointestinal irritation occurring in only 15% of men, and there was no incidence of severe cardiovascular toxicity or deep vein thrombosis. In addition, no other side effects besides slight transient elevated liver enzymes were observed. These findings suggest that lower doses of oral EMP may be a safer option than higher doses for the treatment of prostate cancer. However, a subsequent 2004 meta-analysis of 23 studies of thromboembolic events with EMP found substantial incidence of thromboembolic events regardless of dosage and no association of EMP dose with risk of these complications. == Overdose == There has been no clinical experience with overdose of EMP. Overdose of EMP may result in pronounced manifestations of the known adverse effects of the medication. There is no specific antidote for overdose of EMP. In the event of overdose, gastric lavage should be used to evacuate gastric contents as necessary and treatment should be symptom-based and supportive. In the case of dangerously low counts of red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets, whole blood may be given as needed. Liver function should be monitored with EMP overdose. After an overdose of EMP, hematological and hepatic parameters should continue to be monitored for at least 6 weeks. EMP has been used at high doses of as much as 1,260 mg/day by the oral route and 240 to 450 mg/day by intravenous injection. == Interactions == EMP has been reported to increase the efficacy and toxicity of tricyclic antidepressants like amitriptyline and imipramine. When products containing calcium, aluminium, and/or magnesium, such as dairy products like milk, various foods dietary supplements, and antacids, are consumed concomitantly with EMP, an insoluble chelate complex/phosphate salt between EMP and these metals can be formed, and this can markedly impair the absorption and hence oral bioavailability of EMP. There may be an increased risk of angioedema in those concurrently taking ACE inhibitors. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === EMP, also known as estradiol normustine phosphate, is a combined estrogen ester and nitrogen mustard ester. It consists of estradiol, an estrogen, linked with a phosphate ester as well as an ester of normustine, a nitrogen mustard. In terms of its pharmacodynamic effects, EMP is a prodrug of estramustine, estromustine, and estradiol. As a prodrug of estradiol, EMP is an estrogen and hence an agonist of the estrogen receptors. EMP itself has only very weak affinity for the estrogen receptors. The medication is of about 91% higher molecular weight than estradiol due to the presence of its C3 normustine and C17β phosphate esters. Because EMP is a prodrug of estradiol, it may be considered to be a natural and bioidentical form of estrogen, although it does have additional cytostatic activity via estramustine and estromustine. EMP acts by a dual mechanism of action: 1) direct cytostatic activity via a number of actions; and 2) as a form of high-dose estrogen therapy via estrogen receptor-mediated antigonadotropic and functional antiandrogenic effects. The antigonadotropic and functional antiandrogenic effects of EMP consist of strong suppression of gonadal androgen production and hence circulating levels of androgens such as testosterone; greatly increased levels of sex hormone-binding globulin and hence a decreased fraction of free androgens in the circulation; and direct antiandrogenic actions in prostate cells. The free androgen index with oral EMP has been found to be on average 4.6-fold lower than with orchiectomy. As such, EMP therapy results in considerably stronger androgen deprivation than orchiectomy. Metabolites of EMP, including estramustine, estromustine, estradiol, and estrone, have been found to act as weak antagonists of the androgen receptor (EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration = 0.5–3.1 μM), although the clinical significance of this is unknown. Extremely high levels of estradiol and estrone occur during EMP therapy. The estrogenic metabolites of EMP are responsible for its most common adverse effects and its cardiovascular toxicity. EMP has been described as having relatively weak estrogenic effects in some publications. However, it has shown essentially the same rates and degrees of estrogenic effects, such as breast tenderness, gynecomastia, cardiovascular toxicity, changes in liver protein synthesis, and testosterone suppression, as high-dose diethylstilbestrol and ethinylestradiol in clinical studies. The notion that EMP has relatively weak estrogen activity may have been based on animal research, which found that EMP had 100-fold lower uterotrophic effects than estradiol in rats, and may also not have taken into account the very high doses of EMP used clinically in humans. The mechanism of action of the cytostatic effects of EMP is complex and only partially understood. EMP is considered to mainly be a mitotic inhibitor, inhibiting mechanisms involved in the mitosis phase of the cell cycle. Specifically, it binds to microtubule-associated proteins and/or to tubulin and produces depolymerization of microtubules (Kd = 10–20 μM for estramustine), resulting in the arrest of cell division in the G2/M phase (specifically metaphase). EMP was originally thought to mediate its cytostatic effects as a prodrug of normustine, a nitrogen mustard, and hence was thought to be an alkylating antineoplastic agent. However, subsequent research has found that EMP is devoid of alkylating actions, and that the influence of EMP on microtubules is mediated by intact estramustine and estromustine, with normustine or estradiol alone having only minor or negligible effects. As such, the unique properties of the estramustine and estromustine structures, containing a carbamate-ester bond, appear to be responsible for the cytostatic effects of EMP. In addition to its antimitotic actions, EMP has also been found to produce other cytostatic effects, including induction of apoptosis, interference with DNA synthesis, nuclear matrix interaction, cell membrane alterations, induction of reactive oxygen species (free oxygen radicals), and possibly additional mechanisms. EMP has been found to have a radiosensitizing effect in prostate cancer and glioma cells, improving sensitivity to radiation therapy as well. The cytostatic metabolites of EMP are accumulated in tissues in a selective manner, for instance in prostate cancer cells. This may be due to the presence of a specific estramustine-binding protein (EMBP) (Kd = 10–35 nM for estramustine), also known as prostatin or prostatic secretion protein (PSP), which has been detected in prostate cancer, glioma, melanoma, and breast cancer cells. Because of its tissue selectivity, EMP is said to produce minimal cytostatic effects in healthy tissues, and its tissue selectivity may be responsible for its therapeutic cytostatic efficacy against prostate cancer cells. EMP was originally developed as a dual ester prodrug of an estrogen and normustine as a nitrogen mustard alkylating antineoplastic agent which, due to the affinity of the estrogen moiety for estrogen receptors, would be selectively accumulated in estrogen target tissues and hence estrogen receptor-positive tumor cells. Consequentially, it was thought that EMP would preferentially deliver the alkylating normustine moiety to these tissues, allowing for reduced cytostatic effects in healthy tissues and hence improved efficacy and tolerability. However, subsequent research found that there is very limited and slow cleavage of the normustine ester and that EMP is devoid of alkylating activity. In addition, it appears that estramustine and estromustine may be preferentially accumulated in estrogen target tissues not due to affinity for the estrogen receptors, but instead due to affinity for the distinct EMBP. Extremely high, pregnancy-like levels of estradiol may be responsible for the leukocytosis (increased white blood cell count) that is observed in individuals treated with EMP. This side effect is in contrast to most other cytotoxic agents, which instead cause myelosuppression (bone marrow suppression), leukopenia (decreased white blood cell count), and neutropenia (decreased neutrophil count). ==== Antigonadotropic effects ==== EMP at a dosage 280 mg/day has been found to suppress testosterone levels in men into the castrate range (to 30 ng/dL) within 20 days and to the low castrate range (to 10 ng/dL) within 30 days. Similarly, a dosage of 70 mg/day EMP suppressed testosterone levels into the castrate range within 4 weeks. === Pharmacokinetics === Upon oral ingestion, EMP is rapidly and completely dephosphorylated by phosphatases into estramustine during the first pass in the gastrointestinal tract. Estramustine is also partially but considerably oxidized into estromustine by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases during the first pass. As such, EMP reaches the circulation as estramustine and estromustine, and the major metabolite of EMP is estromustine. A limited quantity of approximately 10 to 15% of estramustine and estromustine is further slowly metabolized via hydrolysis of the normustine ester into estradiol and estrone, respectively. This reaction is believed to be catalyzed by carbamidases, although the genes encoding the responsible enzymes have not been characterized. The circulating levels of normustine formed from EMP are insignificant. Release of nitrogen mustard gas from normustine via cleavage of the carboxylic acid group has not been demonstrated and does not seem to occur. The oral bioavailability of EMP is low, which is due to profound first-pass metabolism; specifically, dephosphorylation of EMP. The oral bioavailability of EMP specifically as estramustine and estromustine is 44 to 75%, suggesting that absorption may be incomplete. In any case, there is a linear relationship between the oral dose of EMP and circulating levels of estramustine and estromustine. Consumption of calcium, aluminium, or magnesium with oral EMP can markedly impair its bioavailability due to diminished absorption from the intestines, and this may interfere with its therapeutic effectiveness at low doses. Following a single oral dose of 420 mg EMP in men with prostate cancer, maximal levels of estromustine were 310 to 475 ng/mL (475,000 pg/mL) and occurred after 2 to 3 hours. Estradiol levels with 280 mg/day oral EMP have been found to increase to very high concentrations within one week of therapy. In one study, levels of estradiol were over 20,000 pg/mL after 10 days, were about 30,000 pg/mL after 30 days, and peaked at about 40,000 pg/mL at 50 days. Another study found lower estradiol levels of 4,900 to 9,000 pg/mL during chronic therapy with 560 mg/day oral EMP. An additional study found estradiol levels of about 17,000 pg/mL with 140 mg/day oral EMP and 38,000 pg/mL with 280 mg/day oral EMP. The circulating levels of estradiol and estrone during EMP therapy have been reported to exceed normal levels in men by more than 100- and 1,000-fold, respectively. Levels of estramustine and estradiol in the circulation are markedly lower than those of estromustine and estrone, respectively, with a ratio of about 1:10 in both cases. Nonetheless, estradiol levels during EMP therapy appear to be similar to those that occur in mid-to-late pregnancy, which range from 5,000 to 40,000 pg/mL. No unchanged EMP is seen in the circulation with oral administration. The pharmacokinetics of EMP are different with intravenous injection. Following a single intravenous injection of 300 mg EMP, levels of EMP were higher than those of its metabolites for the first 8 hours. This is likely due to the bypassing of first-pass metabolism. However, by 24 hours after the dose, unchanged EMP could no longer be detected in the circulation. The clearance of EMP from blood plasma is 4.85 ± 0.684 L/h. The volumes of distribution of EMP with intravenous injection were small; under a two-compartment model, the volume of distribution for the central compartment was 0.043 L/kg and for the peripheral compartment was 0.11 L/kg. The plasma protein binding of EMP is high. Estramustine is accumulated in tumor tissue, for instance prostate cancer and glioma tissue, with estramustine levels much higher in these tissues than in plasma (e.g., 6.3- and 15.9-fold, respectively). Conversely, levels of estromustine in tumor versus plasma are similar (1.0- and 0.5-fold, respectively). Estramustine and estromustine appear to accumulate in adipose tissue. The elimination half-life of estromustine with oral EMP was 13.6 hours on average, with a range of 8.8 to 22.7 hours. Conversely, the elimination half-life of estromustine with intravenous injection was 10.3 hours, with a range of 7.36 to 12.3 hours. For comparison, the corresponding elimination half-lives of estrone were 16.5 and 14.7 hours for oral and intravenous administration, respectively. Estramustine and estromustine are mainly excreted in bile and hence in feces. They are not believed to be excreted in urine. == Chemistry == EMP, also known as estradiol 3-normustine 17β-phosphate or as estradiol 3-(bis(2-chloroethyl)carbamate) 17β-(dihydrogen phosphate), is a synthetic estrane steroid and a derivative of estradiol. It is an estrogen ester; specifically, EMP is a diester of estradiol with a C3 normustine (nitrogen mustard–carbamate moiety) ester and a C17β phosphate ester. EMP is provided as the sodium or meglumine salt. EMP is similar as a compound to other estradiol esters such as estradiol sulfate and estradiol valerate, but differs in the presence of its nitrogen mustard ester moiety. Antineoplastic agents related to EMP, although none of them were marketed, include alestramustine, atrimustine, cytestrol acetate, estradiol mustard, ICI-85966, and phenestrol. Due to its hydrophilic phosphate ester moiety, EMP is a readily water-soluble compound. This is in contrast to most other estradiol esters, which are fatty acid esters and lipophilic compounds that are not particularly soluble in water. Unlike EMP, estramustine is highly lipophilic, practically insoluble in water, and non-ionizable. The phosphate ester of EMP was incorporated into the molecule in order to increase its water solubility and allow for intravenous administration. The molecular weight of EMP sodium is 564.3 g/mol, of EMP meglumine is 715.6 g/mol, of EMP is 520.4 g/mol, of estramustine is 440.4 g/mol, and of estradiol is 272.4 g/mol. As a result of these differences in molecular weights, EMP contains about 52%, EMP sodium about 48%, and EMP meglumine about 38% of the amount of estradiol within their structures as does an equal-mass quantity of estradiol. == History == EMP was first synthesized in the mid-1960s and was patented in 1967. It was initially developed for the treatment of breast cancer. The idea for EMP was inspired by the uptake and accumulation of radiolabeled estrogens into breast cancer tissue. However, initial clinical findings of EMP in women with breast cancer were disappointing. Subsequently, radiolabeled EMP was found to be taken up into and accumulated rat prostate gland, and this finding culminated in the medication being repurposed for the treatment of prostate cancer. EMP was introduced for medical use in the treatment of this condition in the early 1970s, and was approved in the United States for this indication in 1981. EMP was originally introduced for use by intravenous injection. Subsequently, an oral formulation was introduced, and the intravenous preparation was almost abandoned in favor of the oral version. == Society and culture == === Generic names === EMP is provided as the sodium salt for oral administration, which has the generic names estramustine phosphate sodium (USANTooltip United States Adopted Name) and estramustine sodium phosphate (BANMTooltip British Approved Name, JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name), and as the meglumine salt for intravenous administration, which has the generic name estramustine phosphate meglumine. The INNMTooltip International Nonproprietary Name is estramustine phosphate. The name estramustine phosphate is a contraction of estradiol normustine phosphate. EMP is also known by its former developmental code names Leo 299, Ro 21-8837, and Ro 21-8837/001. === Brand names === EMP is most commonly marketed under the brand names Estracyt and Emcyt, but has also been sold under a number of other brand names, including Amsupros, Biasetyl, Cellmustin, Estramustin HEXAL, Estramustina Filaxis, Estranovag, Multosin, Multosin Injekt, Proesta, Prostamustin, and Suloprost. === Availability === EMP is marketed in the United States, Canada, and Mexico under the brand name Emcyt, whereas the medication is marketed under the brand name Estracyt in the United Kingdom and elsewhere throughout Europe as well as in Argentina, Chile, and Hong Kong. It has been discontinued in a number of countries, including Australia, Brazil, Ireland, and Norway. == Research == EMP has been studied in the treatment of other cancers such as glioma and breast cancer. It has been found to slightly improve quality of life in people with glioma during the first 3 months of therapy. == References == == Further reading ==",

         " Mycosis fungoides (MF) is a subtype of CTCL with a low incidence and high medical need for novel treatments. The objective of this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, first-in-human study was to evaluate safety, efficacy, cutaneous and systemic pharmacokinetics (PK) of topical bimiralisib in healthy volunteers (HVs) and MF patients. In this trial, a total of 6 HVs and 19 early-stage MF patients were treated with 2.0% bimiralisib gel and/or placebo. Drug efficacy was assessed by the Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity (CAILS) score, supported by objective measuring methods to quantify lesion severity. PK blood samples were collected frequently and cutaneous PK was investigated in skin punch biopsies on the last day of treatment. Local distribution of bimiralisib in HVs showed a mean exposure of 2.54 µg/g in the epidermis. A systemic concentration was observed after application of a target dose of 2 mg/cm PI3K/mTOR inhibition leads to apoptosis of NOTCH1-mutant head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. We tested the efficacy of the PI3K/mTOR inhibitor bimiralisib in patients with NOTCH1-mutant HNSCC. Patients with recurrent/metastatic NOTCH1-mutant HNSCC who had progressed during chemotherapy and immunotherapy received bimiralisib until unacceptable toxicity or progression. To assess whether NOTCH1 mutations can be detected in blood, we measured circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). To assess activated NOTCH1 protein levels, we quantitated cleaved NOTCH1 (cl-NOTCH) by immunohistochemistry. Eight patients were treated, and 6 were evaluable for response. The objective response rate was 17%. For all 8 patients, median progression-free and overall survival was 5 and 7 months, respectively. Bimiralisib was well tolerated, with expected hyperglycemia. Pharmacokinetic values were consistent with published studies. NOTCH1 mutations were detected in 83.3% of ctDNA. Staining for tumor cl-NOTCH1 was negative. The trial closed early due to sponsor insolvency. Although the trial was small, outcomes with bimiralisib were better than the historical standard of care; Results will need to be confirmed in a larger trial. The lack of cl-NOTCH1 was consistent with loss-of-function mutations and validated our mutation function algorithm. The ability to detect NOTCH1 mutations in blood will help future studies. (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03740100). Bimiralisib is a pan-PI3K/mTOR inhibitor demonstrating antitumor efficacy in preclinical models. The objectives of this study were to identify a maximum tolerated dose (MTD), pharmacokinetics (PK), a dosing schedule, and adverse events (AEs) in patients with advanced solid tumors. Patients received oral bimiralisib to determine the MTD of one continuous (once daily) and two intermittent schedules (A: Days 1, 2 weekly; B: Days 1, 4 weekly) until progression or unacceptable AEs occurred. The MTD for the continuous schedule was 80 mg, with grade three fatigue as the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). No MTD was reached with intermittent schedules, with only one DLT in schedule B. PK analysis suggested that 140 mg (schedule A) was within the biologically active dose range and was selected for further exploration. The most frequent treatment-emergent AEs were hyperglycemia (76.2%) in the continuous schedule, and nausea (56-62.5%) in schedules A and B. The most frequent treatment-emergent > grade three AE for all schedules combined was hyperglycemia (28.6%, continuous schedule; 12.0%, schedule A; 12.5%, schedule B). There was one partial response in a head and neck squamous cancer patient with a NOTCH1 Bimiralisib demonstrated a manageable AE profile consistent with this compound class. Intermittent schedules had fewer > grade three AEs, while also maintaining favorable PK profiles. Intermittent schedule A is proposed for further development in biomarker-selected patient populations.",

It is a white solid that is soluble in water. Like most natural amino acids, it is chiral, only the L-enantiomer occurs in nature, and it exists as the zwitterion at neutral pH. It is an intermediate in cysteine metabolism. It is not a coded amino acid, but is produced post-translationally. Peptides containing the cysteine sulfinic acid residue are substrates for cysteine sulfinic acid reductase. Cysteine sulfinic acid is derived from cysteine. Cysteine is formed from cystathionine via the cystathionine gamma-lyase enzyme, and is either broken down by cysteine lyase or cystathionine gamma-lyase or enters the cysteine sulfinic acid pathway where it is oxidized by cysteine dioxygenase to form cysteine sulfinic acid. Cysteine sulfinic acid, in turn, is decarboxylated by sulfinoalanine decarboxylase to form hypotaurine, which in turn is oxidized by hypotaurine dehydrogenase to yield taurine.

         "Tranylcypromine, sold under the brand name Parnate among others, is a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI). More specifically, tranylcypromine acts as nonselective and irreversible inhibitor of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO). It is used as an antidepressant and anxiolytic agent in the clinical treatment of mood and anxiety disorders, respectively. It is also effective in the treatment of ADHD. Tranylcypromine is also known as trans-2-phenylcyclopropyl-1-amine and is formed pro forma from the cyclization of amphetamine's isopropylamine side chain. As a result, it is classified structurally as a substituted phenethylamine and amphetamine. == Medical uses == Tranylcypromine is used to treat major depressive disorder, including atypical depression, especially when there is an anxiety component, typically as a second-line treatment. It is also used in depression that is not responsive to reuptake inhibitor antidepressants, such as the SSRIs, TCAs, or bupropion. In addition to being a recognized treatment for major depressive disorder, tranylcypromine has been demonstrated to be effective in treating obsessive-compulsive disorder and panic disorder. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have reported that tranylcypromine is significantly more effective in the treatment of depression than placebo and has efficacy over placebo similar to that of other antidepressants such as tricyclic antidepressants. == Contraindications == Contraindications include: Porphyria Cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease Pheochromocytoma Tyramine, found in several foods, is metabolized by MAO. Ingestion and absorption of tyramine causes extensive release of norepinephrine, which can rapidly increase blood pressure to the point of causing hypertensive crisis. Concomitant use of serotonin-enhancing drugs, including SSRIs, serotonergic TCAs, dextromethorphan, and meperidine may cause serotonin syndrome. Concomitant use of MRAs, including fenfluramine, amphetamine, and pseudoephedrine may cause toxicity via serotonin syndrome or hypertensive crisis. L-DOPA given without carbidopa may cause hypertensive crisis. === Dietary restrictions === Tyramine is a biogenic amine produced as a (generally undesirable) byproduct during the fermentation of certain tyrosine-rich foods. It is rapidly metabolized by MAO-A in those not taking MAO-inhibiting drugs. Individuals sensitive to tyramine-induced hypertension may experience an uncomfortable, yet fleeting, increase in blood pressure after ingesting relatively small amounts of tyramine. Advances in food safety standards in most nations, as well as the widespread use of starter-cultures shown to result in undetectable to low levels of tyramine in fermented products has rendered concerns of serious hypertensive crises rare in those consuming a modern diet. Those treated with MAOIs should still exercise caution, particularly at home, if it is unclear whether food has been properly refrigerated. Since tyramine-producing microbes also produce compounds to which humans have a natural aversion, disposal of any questionable food—particularly meats—should be sufficient to avoid hypertensive crises. == Adverse effects == Incidence of adverse effects Very common (>10% incidence) adverse effects include: Dizziness secondary to orthostatic hypotension (17%) Common (1-10% incidence) adverse effects include: Tachycardia (5–10%) Hypomania (7%) Paresthesia (5%) Weight loss (2%) Confusion (2%) Dry mouth (2%) Sexual function disorders (2%) Hypertension (1–2 hours after ingestion) (2%) Rash (2%) Urinary retention (2%) Other (unknown incidence) adverse effects include: Increased/decreased appetite Blood dyscrasias Chest pain Diarrhea Edema Hallucinations Hyperreflexia Insomnia Jaundice Leg cramps Myalgia Palpitations Sensation of cold Suicidal ideation Tremor Of note, there has not been found to be a correlation between sex and age below 65 regarding incidence of adverse effects. Tranylcypromine is not associated with weight gain and has a low risk for hepatotoxicity compared to the hydrazine MAOIs. It is generally recommended that MAOIs be discontinued prior to anesthesia; however, this creates a risk of recurrent depression. In a retrospective observational cohort study, patients on tranylcypromine undergoing general anesthesia had a lower incidence of intraoperative hypotension, while there was no difference between patients not taking an MAOI regarding intraoperative incidence of bradycardia, tachycardia, or hypertension. The use of indirect sympathomimetic drugs or drugs affecting serotonin reuptake, such as meperidine or dextromethorphan poses a risk for hypertension and serotonin syndrome respectively; alternative agents are recommended. Other studies have come to similar conclusions. Pharmacokinetic interactions with anesthetics are unlikely, given that tranylcypromine is a high-affinity substrate for CYP2A6 and does not inhibit CYP enzymes at therapeutic concentrations. Tranylcypromine abuse has been reported at doses ranging from 120 to 600 mg per day. It is thought that higher doses have more amphetamine-like effects and abuse is promoted by the fast onset and short half-life of tranylcypromine. Cases of suicidal ideation and suicidal behaviours have been reported during tranylcypromine therapy or early after treatment discontinuation. Symptoms of tranylcypromine overdose are generally more intense manifestations of its usual effects. == Interactions == In addition to contraindicated concomitant medications, tranylcypromine inhibits CYP2A6, which may reduce the metabolism and increase the toxicity of substrates of this enzyme, such as: Dexmedetomidine nicotine TSNAs (found in cured tobacco products, including cigarettes) Valproate Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors prevent neuronal uptake of tyramine and may reduce its pressor effects. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Tranylcypromine acts as a nonselective and irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase. Regarding the isoforms of monoamine oxidase, it shows slight preference for the MAOB isoenzyme over MAOA. This leads to an increase in the availability of monoamines, such as serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, epinephrine as well as a marked increase in the availability of trace amines, such as tryptamine, octopamine, and phenethylamine. The clinical relevance of increased trace amine availability is unclear. It may also act as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor at higher therapeutic doses. Compared to amphetamine, tranylcypromine shows low potency as a dopamine releasing agent, with even weaker potency for norepinephrine and serotonin release. Tranylcypromine has also been shown to inhibit the histone demethylase, BHC110/LSD1. Tranylcypromine inhibits this enzyme with an IC50 < 2 μM, thus acting as a small molecule inhibitor of histone demethylation with an effect to derepress the transcriptional activity of BHC110/LSD1 target genes. The clinical relevance of this effect is unknown. Tranylcypromine has been found to inhibit CYP46A1 at nanomolar concentrations. The clinical relevance of this effect is unknown. === Pharmacokinetics === Tranylcypromine reaches its maximum concentration (tmax) within 1–2 hours. After a 20 mg dose, plasma concentrations reach at most 50-200 ng/mL. While its half-life is only about 2 hours, its pharmacodynamic effects last several days to weeks due to irreversible inhibition of MAO. Metabolites of tranylcypromine include 4-hydroxytranylcypromine, N-acetyltranylcypromine, and N-acetyl-4-hydroxytranylcypromine, which are less potent MAO inhibitors than tranylcypromine itself. Amphetamine was once thought to be a metabolite of tranylcypromine, but has not been shown to be. Tranylcypromine inhibits CYP2A6 at therapeutic concentrations. == Chemistry == === Synthesis === == History == Tranylcypromine was originally developed as an analog of amphetamine. Although it was first synthesized in 1948, its MAOI action was not discovered until 1959. Precisely because tranylcypromine was not, like isoniazid and iproniazid, a hydrazine derivative, its clinical interest increased enormously, as it was thought it might have a more acceptable therapeutic index than previous MAOIs. The drug was introduced by Smith, Kline and French in the United Kingdom in 1960, and approved in the United States in 1961. It was withdrawn from the market in February 1964 due to a number of patient deaths involving hypertensive crises with intracranial bleeding. However, it was reintroduced later that year with more limited indications and specific warnings of the risks. == Research == Tranylcypromine is known to inhibit LSD1, an enzyme that selectively demethylates two lysines found on histone H3. Genes promoted downstream of LSD1 are involved in cancer cell growth and metastasis, and several tumor cells express high levels of LSD1. Tranylcypromine analogues with more potent and selective LSD1 inhibitory activity are being researched in the potential treatment of cancers. Tranylcypromine may have neuroprotective properties applicable to the treatment of Parkinson's disease, similar to the MAO-B inhibitors selegiline and rasagiline. As of 2017, only one clinical trial in Parkinsonian patients has been conducted, which found some improvement initially and only slight worsening of symptoms after a 1.5 year followup. == See also == Tranylcypromine/trifluoperazine == References ==",

         "Glycolic acid (or hydroxyacetic acid; chemical formula HOCH2CO2H) is a colorless, odorless and hygroscopic crystalline solid, highly soluble in water. It is used in various skin-care products. Glycolic acid is widespread in nature. A glycolate (sometimes spelled \"glycollate\") is a salt or ester of glycolic acid. == History == The name \"glycolic acid\" was coined in 1848 by French chemist Auguste Laurent (1807–1853). He proposed that the amino acid glycine—which was then called glycocolle—might be the amine of a hypothetical acid, which he called \"glycolic acid\" (acide glycolique). Glycolic acid was first prepared in 1851 by German chemist Adolph Strecker (1822–1871) and Russian chemist Nikolai Nikolaevich Sokolov (1826–1877). They produced it by treating hippuric acid with nitric acid and nitrogen dioxide to form an ester of benzoic acid and glycolic acid (C6H5C(=O)OCH2COOH), which they called \"benzoglycolic acid\" (Benzoglykolsäure; also benzoyl glycolic acid). They boiled the ester for days with dilute sulfuric acid, thereby obtaining benzoic acid and glycolic acid (Glykolsäure). == Preparation == Glycolic acid can be synthesized in various ways. The predominant approaches use a catalyzed reaction of formaldehyde with synthesis gas (carbonylation of formaldehyde), for its low cost. It is also prepared by the reaction of chloroacetic acid with sodium hydroxide followed by re-acidification. Other methods, not noticeably in use, include hydrogenation of oxalic acid, and hydrolysis of the cyanohydrin derived from formaldehyde. Some of today's glycolic acids are formic acid-free. Glycolic acid can be isolated from natural sources, such as sugarcane, sugar beets, pineapple, cantaloupe and unripe grapes. Glycolic acid can also be prepared using an enzymatic biochemical process that may require less energy. == Properties == Glycolic acid is slightly stronger than acetic acid due to the electron-withdrawing power of the terminal hydroxyl group. The carboxylate group can coordinate to metal ions, forming coordination complexes. Of particular note are the complexes with Pb2+ and Cu2+ which are significantly stronger than complexes with other carboxylic acids. This indicates that the hydroxyl group is involved in complex formation, possibly with the loss of its proton. == Applications == Glycolic acid is used in the textile industry as a dyeing and tanning agent. === Organic synthesis === Glycolic acid is a useful intermediate for organic synthesis, in a range of reactions including: oxidation-reduction, esterification and long chain polymerization. It is used as a monomer in the preparation of polyglycolic acid and other biocompatible copolymers (e.g. PLGA). Commercially, important derivatives include the methyl (CAS# 96-35-5) and ethyl (CAS# 623-50-7) esters which are readily distillable (boiling points 147–149 °C and 158–159 °C, respectively), unlike the parent acid. The butyl ester (b.p. 178–186 °C) is a component of some varnishes, being desirable because it is nonvolatile and has good dissolving properties. == Occurrence == Plants produce glycolic acid during photorespiration. It is recycled by conversion to glycine within the peroxisomes and to tartronic acid semialdehyde within the chloroplasts. Because photorespiration is a wasteful side reaction in regard to photosynthesis, much effort has been devoted to suppressing its formation. One process converts glycolate into glycerate without using the conventional BASS6 and PLGG1 route; see glycerate pathway. == Safety == Glycolic acid is an irritant to the skin. It occurs in all green plants. == References == == External links == Glycolic acid MS Spectrum Hazardous Substances Data Bank",

         "Ethionamide is an antibiotic used to treat tuberculosis. Specifically it is used, along with other antituberculosis medications, to treat active multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. It is no longer recommended for leprosy. It is taken by mouth. Ethionamide has a high rate of side effects. Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and loss of appetite. Serious side effects may include liver inflammation and depression. It should not be used in people with significant liver problems. Use in pregnancy is not recommended as safety is unclear. Ethionamide is in the thioamides family of medications. It is believed to work by interfering with the use of mycolic acid. Ethionamide was discovered in 1956 and approved for medical use in the United States in 1965. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Ethionamide is used in combination with other antituberculosis agents as part of a second-line regimen for active tuberculosis. Ethionamide is well absorbed orally with or without food, but is often administered with food to improve tolerance. It crosses the blood brain barrier to achieve concentrations in the cerebral-spinal fluid equivalent to plasma. The antimicrobial spectrum of ethionamide includes M. tuberculosis, M. bovis and M. smegmatis. It also is used rarely against infections with M. leprae and other nontuberculous mycobacteria such as M. avium and M. kansasii. While working in a similar manner to isoniazid, cross resistance is only seen in 13% of strains, since they are both prodrugs but activated by different pathways. Resistance can emerge from mutations in ethA, which is needed to activate the drug, or ethR, which can be overexpressed to repress ethA. Mutations in inhA or the promoter of inhA can also lead to resistance through changing the binding site or overexpression. The FDA has placed it in pregnancy category C, because it has caused birth defects in animal studies. It is not known whether ethionamide is excreted into breast milk. == Adverse effects == Ethionamide frequently causes gastrointestinal distress with nausea and vomiting which can lead patients to stop taking it. This can sometimes be improved by taking it with food. Ethionamide can cause hepatocellular toxicity and is contraindicated in patients with severe liver impairment. Patients on ethionamide should have regular monitoring of their liver function tests. Liver toxicity occurs in up to 5% of patients and follows a pattern similar to isoniazid, usually arising in the first 1 to 3 months of therapy, but can occur even after more than 6 months of therapy. The pattern of liver function test derangement is often a rise in the ALT and AST. Both central neurological side effects such as psychiatric disturbances and encephalopathy, along with peripheral neuropathy have been reported. Administering pyridoxine along with ethionamide may reduce these effects and is recommended. Ethionamide is structurally similar to methimazole, which is used to inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis, and has been linked to hypothyroidism in several TB patients. Periodic monitoring of thyroid function while on ethionamide is recommended. === Interactions === Ethionamide may worsen the adverse effects of other antituberculous drugs being taken at the same time. It boosts levels of isoniazid when taken together and can lead to increased rates of peripheral neuropathy and hepatotoxicity. When taken with cycloserine, seizures have been reported. High rates of hepatotoxicty have been reported when taken with rifampicin. The drug's labeling cautions against excessive alcohol ingestion as it may provoke a psychotic reaction. == Mechanism of action == Ethionamide is a prodrug which is activated by the enzyme ethA, a mono-oxygenase in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and then binds NAD+ to form an adduct which inhibits InhA in the same way as isoniazid. The mechanism of action is thought to be through disruption of mycolic acid. Expression of the ethA gene is controlled by ethR, a transcriptional repressor. It is thought that improving ethA expression will increase the efficacy of ethionamide and prompting interest by drug developers in EthR inhibitors as a co-drug. == Other names == 1314 2-ethylisothionicotinamide amidazine thioamide iridocin It is sold under the brand name Trecator by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals which was purchased by Pfizer in 2009. == References == == External links == \"Ethionamide\".

         "Tetrahydropalmatine (THP) is an isoquinoline alkaloid found in several different plant species, mainly in the genus Corydalis (Yan Hu Suo), but also in other plants such as Stephania rotunda. These plants have traditional uses in Chinese herbal medicine. The pharmaceutical industry has synthetically produced the more potent enantiomer Levo-tetrahydropalmatine (Levo-THP; technically l-THP, often written L-THP), which has been marketed worldwide under different brand names as an alternative to anxiolytic and sedative drugs of the benzodiazepine group and analgesics such as opiates. It is also sold as a dietary supplement. In 1940, a Vietnamese scientist Sang Dinh Bui extracted an alkaloid from the root of Stephania rotunda with the yield of 1.2–1.5% and he named this compound rotundin. From 1950 to 1952, two Indian scientists studied and extracted from Stephania glabra another alkaloid named hyndanrine. In 1965, the structure of rotundine and hyndarin was proved to be the same as tetrahydropalmatine. == Effects == Tetrahydropalmatine has been demonstrated to possess analgesic effects and may be beneficial in the treatment of heart disease and liver damage. It is a blocker of voltage-activated L-type calcium channel active potassium channels. It is a potent muscle relaxant. It is widely used in China as a sedative. It has also shown potential in the treatment of drug addiction to both cocaine and opiates, and preliminary human studies have shown promising results. In animal models, anti-addiction effects can manifest at sub-sedative doses. == Adverse effects == In November 2013, the Chinese National Medical Products Administration issued an order asking for all medications containing l-THP to have their package inserts revised, prohibiting use in pregnant women and those with extrapyramidal disorders, requiring warnings about liver impairement and operation of machinery, and highlighting risks of drowsiness and extrapyramidal symptoms with overuse or when combined with other CNS depressants. Long-term is not advised. The same order lists the following OTC medications as containing l-THP: == Mechanism of action == The pharmacological profile of l-THP includes antagonism of dopamine D1, and D2 receptors as well as actions at dopamine D3, alpha adrenergic and serotonin receptors. The Ki values for l-THP at D1 and D2 dopamine receptors are approximately 124 nM (D1) and 388 nM (D2). In addition to the antagonism of post-synaptic dopamine receptors, the blockade of pre-synaptic autoreceptors by l-THP results in increased dopamine release, and it has been suggested that lower affinity of l-THP for D2 receptors may confer some degree of autoreceptor selectivity. Along with dopamine receptors, l-THP has been reported to interact with a number of other receptor types, including alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, at which it functions as an antagonist, and GABA-A receptors, through positive allosteric modulation. Additionally, l-THP displays significant binding to 5-HT1A and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. In the case of 5-HT1A receptors, l-THP binds with a Ki of approximately 340 nM. Animal experiments have shown that the sedative effect of THP results from blocking dopaminergic neurons in the brain. Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system where it occurs in several important signaling systems that regulate muscular activity and attention, as well as feelings of joy, enthusiasm, and creativity. Therefore, THP causes no feelings of euphoria, and has been seen as an alternative to addictive drugs for people suffering from anxiety and pain, and as a possibility for relief for people not helped by existing drugs. == Cases of poisoning == Several cases of poisoning related to THP have been reported. These cases involved bradycardia, respiratory depression, and CNS depression. Some cases report hepatitis, acute and chronic. Fatalities started to be reported in 1999 in cases where an overdose of THP had been used in combination with other drugs having analgesic and anti-anxiety effects. All 1999 deaths could be tied to a single THP-based supplement, sold under the name \"Jin Bu Huan Anodyne Tablets\". Toxicity has been reported in children when taken alone. This product was therefore blacklisted by US and European health authorities. In some other countries, such as Singapore, THP is treated as a controlled substance, and license is required to sell it. In addition, chronic hepatitis has been reported, caused by THP production in East Asia under conditions that were insufficiently sterile. == Research == The University of Maryland has completed a phase I study for THP in people with a history of cocaine use. Their phase II study for cocaine use disorder was withdrawn due to a lack of funding. l-THP does not improve psychiatric symptoms when added on top of antipsychotics in schizophrenia. == See also == == References == == External links == Introduction to Rotundine ZINC entry",

Additionally, l-THP displays significant binding to 5-HT1A and alpha-2 adrenergic receptors. In the case of 5-HT1A receptors, l-THP binds with a Ki of approximately 340 nM. Animal experiments have shown that the sedative effect of THP results from blocking dopaminergic neurons in the brain. Dopamine is an important neurotransmitter in the central nervous system where it occurs in several important signaling systems that regulate muscular activity and attention, as well as feelings of joy, enthusiasm, and creativity. Therefore, THP causes no feelings of euphoria, and has been seen as an alternative to addictive drugs for people suffering from anxiety and pain, and as a possibility for relief for people not helped by existing drugs. == Cases of poisoning == Several cases of poisoning related to THP have been reported. These cases involved bradycardia, respiratory depression, and CNS depression. Some cases report hepatitis, acute and chronic. Fatalities started to be reported in 1999 in cases where an overdose of THP had been used in combination with other drugs having analgesic and anti-anxiety effects. All 1999 deaths could be tied to a single THP-based supplement, sold under the name \"Jin Bu Huan Anodyne Tablets\". Toxicity has been reported in children when taken alone. This product was therefore blacklisted by US and European health authorities. In some other countries, such as Singapore, THP is treated as a controlled substance, and license is required to sell it. In addition, chronic hepatitis has been reported, caused by THP production in East Asia under conditions that were insufficiently sterile. == Research == The University of Maryland has completed a phase I study for THP in people with a history of cocaine use. Their phase II study for cocaine use disorder was withdrawn due to a lack of funding. l-THP does not improve psychiatric symptoms when added on top of antipsychotics in schizophrenia. == See also == == References == == External links == Introduction to Rotundine ZINC entry",

         "Ethambutol (EMB, E) is a medication primarily used to treat tuberculosis. It is usually given in combination with other tuberculosis medications, such as isoniazid, rifampicin and pyrazinamide. It may also be used to treat Mycobacterium avium complex, and Mycobacterium kansasii. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include problems with vision, joint pain, nausea, headaches, and feeling tired. Other side effects include liver problems and allergic reactions. It is not recommended in people with optic neuritis, significant kidney problems, or under the age of five. Use during pregnancy or breastfeeding has not been found to cause harm. In the United States the FDA has raised concerns about eye issues in the baby if used during pregnancy. Ethambutol is believed to work by interfering with the bacteria's metabolism. Ethambutol was discovered in 1961. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines and is available as a generic medication. == Chirality and biological activity == (S,S)-(+)-Ethambutol is powerful and selective antitubercular drug. It is a typical example of an old drug that was introduced for clinical use in its unichiral form. Ethambutol contains two constitutionally symmetrical chiral centers in its structure and exists in three stereoisomeric forms, the enantiomeric pair (+)-(S,S)- and (−)-(R,R)-ethambutol, along with the achiral stereoisomer called meso-form. The (+)-(S,S)-enantiomer harbors the antitubercular activity. This enantiomer is 500 and 12 fold more potent than (−)-(R,R)-ethambutol and the meso-form respectively. On the other hand, all the three isomers are equipotent in terms of the major side-effect of the drug, optic neuritis. Toxicity is associated to both dose and duration of treatment. Hence the use of (S,S)-enantiomer greatly improved the risk/benefit balance. == Medical uses == Ethambutol is used along with other medications to treat a number of infections including: tuberculosis, Mycobacterium avium complex, and Mycobacterium kansasii. == Adverse effects == Optic neuritis (hence contraindicated in children below six years of age) Red–green color blindness People taking ethambutol should be monitored for changes in visual acuity and color discrimination. Arthralgia Hyperuricaemia Vertical nystagmus Skin rash == Mechanism of action == Ethambutol is bacteriostatic against actively growing TB bacilli. It works by obstructing the formation of cell wall. Mycolic acids attach to the 5'-hydroxyl groups of D-arabinose residues of arabinogalactan and form mycolyl-arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex in the cell wall. It disrupts arabinogalactan synthesis by inhibiting the enzyme arabinosyl transferase. Disruption of the arabinogalactan synthesis inhibits the formation of this complex and leads to increased permeability of the cell wall. == Pharmacokinetics == It is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and well distributed in body tissues and fluids. 50% is excreted unchanged in urine. == References ==",

         "Medical",
         "Acamprosate, sold under the brand name Campral, is a medication which reduces alcoholism cravings. It is thought to stabilize chemical signaling in the brain that would otherwise be disrupted by alcohol withdrawal. When used alone, acamprosate is not an effective therapy for alcohol use disorder in most individuals, as it only addresses withdrawal symptoms and not psychological dependence. Acamprosate is a medication that works in the brain to treat alcohol use disorder. Acamprosate works by decreasing cravings and urges to use alcohol. This allows people who take the medication to control urges to drink and help to continue to not use alcohol. Acamprosate does not help with symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. It facilitates a reduction in alcohol consumption as well as full abstinence when used in combination with psychosocial support or other drugs that address the addictive behavior. Serious side effects include allergic reactions, abnormal heart rhythms, and low or high blood pressure, while less serious side effects include headaches, insomnia, and impotence. Diarrhea is the most common side-effect. It is unclear if use is safe during pregnancy. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == Acamprosate is useful when used along with counseling in the treatment of alcohol use disorder. Over three to twelve months it increases the number of people who do not drink at all and the number of days without alcohol. It appears to work as well as naltrexone for maintenance of abstinence from alcohol, however naltrexone works slightly better for reducing alcohol cravings and heavy drinking, and acamprosate tends to work more poorly outside of Europe where treatment services are less robust. Difference in severity may also play a role. === Compliance === Some struggle to take the full course of medication (2 tablets, 3 times a day), which makes acamprosate less effective. Standard support to help people take their medication involves monthly check-ins with addiction services or a GP. Research found that compared to standard support alone, extra telephone support by a pharmacist, plus financial incentives, increased the numbers who took medication as prescribed and was cost-effective. The same telephone support without financial incentives did not significantly increase the numbers taking their medication as prescribed and was less cost-effective. == Contraindications == Acamprosate is primarily removed by the kidneys. A dose reduction is suggested in those with moderately impaired kidneys (creatinine clearance between 30 mL/min and 50 mL/min). It is also contraindicated in those who have a strong allergic reaction to acamprosate calcium or any of its components. == Adverse effects == The US label carries warnings about increases in suicidal behavior, major depressive disorder, and kidney failure. Adverse effects that caused people to stop taking the drug in clinical trials included diarrhea, nausea, depression, and anxiety. Potential adverse effects include headache, stomach pain, back pain, muscle pain, joint pain, chest pain, infections, flu-like symptoms, chills, heart palpitations, high blood pressure, fainting, vomiting, upset stomach, constipation, increased appetite, weight gain, edema, sleepiness, decreased sex drive, impotence, forgetfulness, abnormal thinking, abnormal vision, distorted sense of taste, tremors, runny nose, coughing, difficulty breathing, sore throat, bronchitis, and rashes. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === The pharmacodynamics of acamprosate are complex and not fully understood. Ethanol and benzodiazepines act on the central nervous system by binding to the GABAA receptor, increasing the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (i.e., they act as positive allosteric modulators at these receptors). In alcohol use disorder, one of the main mechanisms of tolerance is attributed to GABAA receptors becoming downregulated (i.e. these receptors become less sensitive to GABA). When alcohol is no longer consumed, these down-regulated GABAA receptor complexes are so insensitive to GABA that the typical amount of GABA produced has little effect, leading to physical withdrawal symptoms; since GABA normally inhibits neural firing, GABAA receptor desensitization results in unopposed excitatory neurotransmission (i.e., fewer inhibitory postsynaptic potentials occur through GABAA receptors), leading to neuronal over-excitation (i.e., more action potentials in the postsynaptic neuron). In addition, alcohol also inhibits the activity of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs). Chronic alcohol consumption leads to the overproduction (upregulation) of these receptors. Thereafter, sudden alcohol abstinence causes the excessive numbers of NMDARs to be more active than normal and to contribute to the symptoms of delirium tremens and excitotoxic neuronal death. Withdrawal from alcohol induces a surge in release of excitatory neurotransmitters like glutamate, which activates NMDARs. Acamprosate reduces this glutamate surge. The drug also protects cultured cells from excitotoxicity induced by ethanol withdrawal and from glutamate exposure combined with ethanol withdrawal. Although its ability to correct an overabundance of glutamate is well-established, the actual molecular target behind this action is poorly known. Knowledge on this topic has seen several major revisions. ==== GABA/NMDA hypothesis ==== It is originally believed to act as an NMDA receptor antagonist and positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors. Its activity on those receptors is indirect, unlike that of most other agents used in this context. An inhibition of the GABA-B system is believed to cause indirect enhancement of GABAA receptors. The effects on the NMDA complex are dose-dependent; the product appears to enhance receptor activation at low concentrations, while inhibiting it when consumed in higher amounts, which counters the excessive activation of NMDA receptors in the context of alcohol withdrawal. At high concentrations, well above those that occur clinically (1 μM to 3 μM), reports of inhibition of glutamate receptor-activated responses (1 mM), enhancement of NMDA receptor function (300 μM), weak antagonization of the NMDA receptor, and partial agonism of the polyamine site of the NMDA receptor. However, no direct action of acamprosate at clinically relevant concentrations has yet been reported. At clinical levels, any inhibiton of the NMDA receptor probably occurs in a allosteric way. One of acamprosate's purported mechanisms of action is the enhancement of GABA signaling at GABAA receptors via positive allosteric receptor modulation. It has been purported to open the chloride ion channel in a novel way as it does not require GABA as a cofactor, making it less liable for dependence than benzodiazepines. Acamprosate has been successfully used to control tinnitus, hyperacusis, ear pain, and inner ear pressure during alcohol use due to spasms of the tensor tympani muscle. ==== mGluR hypothesis ==== Two later hypothesized targets are mGluR1 and mGluR5 (10 μM). The idea originated from the fact that acamprosate blocked the neurotoxicity of an agonist of mGluR1 and mGluR5. However, a subsequent study found no action of acamprosate on the mGluR1 or mGluR5 at concentrations as high as 100 μM, nor at GABAA or glycine receptors or voltage-gated sodium channels. In addition, even if the 10 μM figure is correct, it would still be clinically irrelevant. ==== Calcium hypothesis ==== Spanagel et al. (2014) show that the effects of acamprosate calcium can mostly be attributed to the calcium component. Replacing calcium with sodium produces an inactive drug. Calcium chloride has a similar effect on glutamate neurotransmission. Moreover, calcium carbonate has a similar craving-reducing effect on human alcoholics. ==== Synergy hypothesis ==== Ademar et al. (2023) report that acamprosate sodium does, in fact, enhance the effect of calcium chloride in an animal alcoholism model, and hence is not a fully inactive molecule. They also show a role of increased dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbe downstream of the glycine receptor, partly mimicking ethanol. ==== Other effects ==== The product also increases the endogenous production of taurine. The substance also helps re-establish a standard sleep architecture by normalizing stage 3 and REM sleep phases, which is believed to be an important aspect of its pharmacological activity. === Pharmacokinetics === Acamprosate is not metabolized by the human body. Acamprosate's absolute bioavailability from oral administration is approximately 11%, and its bioavailability is decreased when taken with food. Following administration and absorption of acamprosate, it is excreted unchanged (i.e., as acamprosate) via the kidneys. Co-administration with naltrexone increases plasma levels. Its absorption and elimination are very slow, with a tmax of 6 hours and an elimination half life of over 30 hours. Steady-state levels are reached by day 5 of oral treatment. == History == Acamprosate was developed by Lipha, a subsidiary of Merck KGaA. and was approved for marketing in Europe in 1989. In October 2001 Forest Laboratories acquired the rights to market the drug in the US. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July 2004. The first generic versions of acamprosate were launched in the US in 2013. As of 2015, acamprosate was in development by Confluence Pharmaceuticals as a potential treatment for fragile X syndrome. The drug was granted orphan drug designation for this use by the FDA in 2013, and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2014. == Society and culture == === Names === Acamprosate is the International Nonproprietary Name (INN) and the British Approved Name (BAN). Acamprosate calcium is the United States Adopted Name (USAN) and the Japanese Accepted Name (JAN). It is also technically known as N-acetylhomotaurine or as calcium acetylhomotaurinate. It is sold under the brand name Campral. == Research == In addition to its apparent ability to help people refrain from drinking, some evidence suggests that acamprosate is neuroprotective (that is, it protects neurons from damage and death caused by the effects of alcohol withdrawal, and possibly other causes of neurotoxicity). It has been tried for autism, both ideopathic and fragile X syndrome-linked. It appears to reduce amyloid-beta precursor protein levels. == References ==",

         " Pegylated recombinant human hyaluronidase (PEGPH20) degrades hyaluronan (HA) and, in combination with chemotherapy, prolongs survival in preclinical models. The activity of PEGPH20 with modified fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFIRINOX) was evaluated in patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer (mPC). Patients had untreated mPC, a performance status of 0 to 1, and adequate organ function. Tumor HA status was not required for eligibility. After a phase Ib dose-finding study of mFOLFIRINOX plus PEGPH20, the phase II open-label study randomly assigned patients (1:1) to the combination arm or to mFOLFIRINOX alone (n = 138). The primary end point was overall survival (OS). PEGPH20 dosages of 3 µg/kg every 2 weeks were more tolerable than twice-weekly dosages used in the phase I study, so 3 µg/kg every 2 weeks was the phase II dosage. An amendment instituted enoxaparin prophylaxis in the PEGPH20 combination arm as a result of increased thromboembolic (TE) events. The planned interim futility analysis when 35 deaths (of 103 analyzable patients) occurred resulted in an OS hazard ratio (HR) of 2.07 that favored the control arm, and the study was closed to accrual. The treatment-related grade 3 to 4 toxicity was significantly increased in the PEGPH20 combination arm relative to control (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.1 to 7.1). The median OS in the mFOLFIRINOX arm was 14.4 months (95% CI, 10.1 to 15.7 months) versus 7.7 months (95% CI, 4.6 to 9.3 months) in the PEGPH20 combination arm. Addition of PEGPH20 to mFOLFIRINOX seems to be detrimental in patients unselected for tumor HA status. This combination caused increased toxicity (mostly GI and TE events) and resulted in decreased treatment duration compared with mFOLFIRINOX alone. The median OS in the mFOLFIRINOX control arm (14.4 months) is, to our knowledge, the longest yet reported and can be considered for patients with good PS. Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading viral cause of lower respiratory tract disease in infants and children worldwide. In previous work to develop point mutations in RSV with improved genetic stability, we observed that an attenuating mutation at amino acid position 1321 in the L polymerase protein was subject to deattenuation by a spontaneous second-site compensatory mutation at position 1313 (C. Luongo, C. C. Winter, P. L. Collins, and U. J. Buchholz, J. Virol. 86:10792-10804, 2012). In the present study, we found that deletion of position 1313 (Δ1313), irrespective of the presence of an attenuating mutation at position 1321, provided a new attenuating mutation. RSV bearing Δ1313 replicated in cell culture as efficiently as wild-type virus at 32°C, was restricted for replication at 37°C, and was restricted 50-fold and 150-fold in the upper and lower respiratory tracts, respectively, of mice. We combined the Δ1313 deletion with the previously described, attenuating NS2 gene deletion (ΔNS2) to produce the recombinant live-attenuated RSV vaccine candidate ΔNS2/Δ1313. During in vitro stress tests involving serial passage at incrementally increasing temperatures, a second-site compensatory mutation was detected in close proximity of Δ1313, namely, I1314T. This site was genetically and phenotypically stabilized by an I1314L substitution. Combination of I1314L with ΔNS2/Δ1313 yielded a virus, ΔNS2/Δ1313/1314L, with genetic stability at physiological temperature. This stabilized vaccine candidate was moderately temperature sensitive and had a level of restriction in chimpanzees comparable to that of MEDI-559, a promising RSV vaccine candidate that presently is in clinical trials but lacks stabilized attenuating mutations. The level of attenuation and genetic stability identify ΔNS2/Δ1313/1314L as a promising candidate for evaluation in pediatric phase I studies.",

         "Aloin, also known as barbaloin, is a bitter, yellow-brown colored compound noted in the exudate of at least 68 Aloe species at levels from 0.1 to 6.6% of leaf dry weight (making between 3% and 35% of the total exudate), and in another 17 species at indeterminate levels [Reynolds, 1995b]. It is used as a stimulant-laxative, treating constipation by inducing bowel movements. The compound is present in what is commonly referred to as the aloe latex that exudes from cells adjacent to the vascular bundles, found under the rind of the leaf and in between it and the gel. When dried, it has been used as a bittering agent in commerce (alcoholic beverages) [21 CFR 172.510. Scientific names given include Aloe perryi, A. barbadensis (= A. vera), A. ferox, and hybrids of A. ferox with A. africana and A. spicata.]. Aloe is listed in federal regulations as a natural substance that may be \"safely used in food\" when used \"in the minimum quantity required to produce their intended physical or technical effect and in accordance with all the principles of good manufacturing practice.\" This food application is generally limited to use in quite small quantities as a flavoring in alcoholic beverages and may usually be identified only as a \"natural flavor.\" In May 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a ruling that aloe laxatives are no longer generally recognized as safe (GRAS) and effective, meaning that aloin-containing products are no longer available in over-the-counter drug products in the United States, because they may be carcinogenic and more data is needed to establish otherwise. Aloe vera leaf latex is a concentrate of an herb or other botanical, and so meets the statutory description of an ingredient that may be used in dietary supplements. == Structure and preparation == Aloin extracted from natural sources is a mixture of two diastereomers, termed aloin A (also called barbaloin) and aloin B (or isobarbaloin), which have similar chemical properties. Aloin is an anthraquinone glycosyl, meaning that its anthraquinone skeleton has been modified by the addition of a sugar molecule. Anthraquinones are a common family of naturally occurring yellow, orange, and red pigments of which many have cathartic properties, attributes shared by aloin. Aloin is related to aloe emodin, which lacks a sugar group but shares aloin's biological properties. Aloin is usually prepared by extraction from aloe latex (the term \"Cape aloe\" also refers to the dried latex of the leaves of several species of the genus Aloe, especially A. ferox [Blumenthal, 1998]), the bitter yellow exudate that seeps out from just underneath the skin of aloe leaves. The latex is then dried and powdered to make the final product, often made into tablets or a beverage, though aloin does not have good stability in aqueous solutions. Products derived from the gel of the aloe plant do not contain appreciable amounts of aloin, and have not been proven effective for any disease or condition when taken orally. == Effects == Once ingested, aloin increases peristaltic contractions in the colon, which induces bowel movements. Aloin also prevents the colon from re-absorbing water from the gastrointestinal tract, which leads to softer stools. This effect is caused by aloin's opening of chloride channels of the colonic membrane. In higher doses, these effects may lead to electrolyte imbalance, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, which are common side-effects of the drug. Because aloin can potentially cause uterine contractions, pregnant women should avoid ingesting aloe products containing aloin in more than trace amounts. In a study on consumption of aloe in rats and tilapia (with no separation of gel from aloin), significant negative health effects were found, including normocytic normochromic anaemia (low red blood cell count, but normal cells), hypoproteinaemia, and high AST levels. As many studies involving aloe gel (without aloin) have not observed these negative effects, it is possible that the negative effects could in large part be due to aloin. == Legal status == Plant-derived remedies containing aloin and other anthraquinones have been used as traditional medicines since antiquity, but harsh side effects make aloin generally unsuitable for household or daily use. In 2002, the US FDA mandated that manufacturers reformulate or stop manufacturing over-the-counter products containing aloe because the agency did not receive necessary safety data. The substance is still allowed in dietary supplements [21 U.S.C. 321 (ff)(1)] and is allowed for use in foods (primarily alcoholic beverages). == References == == External links == Aloin MSDS",

         " Esophageal cancer (EC) is a common malignant tumor of the digestive system. Exploring the molecular biological mechanism of EC will help to clarify its carcinogenesis mechanism, find important molecular targets in the process of carcinogenesis, and provide new ideas for the diagnosis and treatment of EC. Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway is one of the signal transduction pathways most closely related to cell proliferation and apoptosis. The regulation of various downstream molecules affects the proliferation and growth of tumor cells. In this study, we determined the effect of different concentrations of afuresertib on cell viability by MTT assay and determined the effect of afuresertib on cell apoptosis by Annexin V-FITC/PI dual staining. Animal experiments verified the effects of afuresertib on VEGF, bFGF, and PI3K/Akt. Our results indicated that afuresertib is closely related to the survival, proliferation, and apoptosis of esophageal cancer cell lines. More importantly, we found that afuresertib could reduce tumor volume and mass in EC rats through in vivo experiments. In conclusion, afuresertib may exert its antitumor effect by inhibiting the expression of PI3K and Akt-related proteins in rat tumor tissues. Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a highly aggressive neuroendocrine neoplasm of the skin, which has an exceedingly poor prognosis. The AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway, which plays a pivotal role in the modulation of protein synthesis and cell survival, has been shown to be extremely important for Merkel cell carcinogenesis. In the current study, we found that AKT has important regulatory functions in MCC cells and that inhibition of AKT with the novel ATP-competitive AKT inhibitor, afuresertib, has widespread effects on proliferative pathways. In particular, we found that treatment of MCC cells with afuresertib led to deactivation of mTOR and glycogen synthase kinase 3 pathway proteins while increasing activation of proapoptotic pathways through the upregulation of p16 expression and phosphomodulation of the B-cell lymphoma-2-associated death promoter. Overall, afuresertib treatment led to significant and robust inhibition of MCC cell proliferation, thus raising intriguing questions regarding the potential efficacy of AKT inhibition for the future clinical management of MCC. Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), an asbestos-related occupational disease, is an aggressive and incurable tumor of the thoracic cavity. Despite recent advances in MPM treatment, overall survival of patients with MPM is very low. Recent studies have implicated that PI3K/Akt signaling is involved in MPM cell survival and development. To investigate the effects of Akt inhibitors on MPM cell survival, we examined the effects of nine selective Akt inhibitors, namely, afuresertib, Akti-1/2, AZD5363, GSK690693, ipatasertib, MK-2206, perifosine, PHT-427, and TIC10, on six MPM cell lines, namely, ACC-MESO-4, Y-MESO-8A, MSTO-211H, NCI-H28, NCI-H290, and NCI-H2052, and a normal mesothelial cell line MeT-5A.

         "A fortification (also called a fort, fortress, fastness, or stronghold) is a military construction designed for the defense of territories in warfare, and is used to establish rule in a region during peacetime. The term is derived from Latin fortis (\"strong\") and facere (\"to make\"). From very early history to modern times, defensive walls have often been necessary for cities to survive in an ever-changing world of invasion and conquest. Some settlements in the Indus Valley Civilization were the first small cities to be fortified. In ancient Greece, large cyclopean stone walls fitted without mortar had been built in Mycenaean Greece, such as the ancient site of Mycenae. A Greek phrourion was a fortified collection of buildings used as a military garrison, and is the equivalent of the Roman castellum or fortress. These constructions mainly served the purpose of a watch tower, to guard certain roads, passes, and borders. Though smaller than a real fortress, they acted as a border guard rather than a real strongpoint to watch and maintain the border. The art of setting out a military camp or constructing a fortification traditionally has been called \"castrametation\" since the time of the Roman legions. Fortification is usually divided into two branches: permanent fortification and field fortification. There is also an intermediate branch known as semipermanent fortification. Castles are fortifications which are regarded as being distinct from the generic fort or fortress in that they are a residence of a monarch or noble and command a specific defensive territory. Roman forts and hill forts were the main antecedents of castles in Europe, which emerged in the 9th century in the Carolingian Empire. The Early Middle Ages saw the creation of some towns built around castles. Medieval-style fortifications were largely made obsolete by the arrival of cannons in the 14th century. Fortifications in the age of black powder evolved into much lower structures with greater use of ditches and earth ramparts that would absorb and disperse the energy of cannon fire. Walls exposed to direct cannon fire were very vulnerable, so the walls were sunk into ditches fronted by earth slopes to improve protection. The arrival of explosive shells in the 19th century led to another stage in the evolution of fortification. Star forts did not fare well against the effects of high explosives, and the intricate arrangements of bastions, flanking batteries and the carefully constructed lines of fire for the defending cannon could be rapidly disrupted by explosive shells. Steel-and-concrete fortifications were common during the 19th and early 20th centuries. The advances in modern warfare since World War I have made large-scale fortifications obsolete in most situations. == History == === Early uses === Defensive fences for protecting humans and domestic animals against predators was used long before the appearance of writing and began \"perhaps with primitive man blocking the entrances of his caves for security from large carnivores\". From very early history to modern times, walls have been a necessity for many cities. Amnya Fort in western Siberia has been described by archeologists as one of the oldest known fortified settlements, as well as the northernmost Stone Age fort. In Bulgaria, near the town of Provadia a walled fortified settlement today called Solnitsata starting from 4700 BC had a diameter of about 300 feet (91 m), was home to 350 people living in two-story houses, and was encircled by a fortified wall. The huge walls around the settlement, which were built very tall and with stone blocks which are 6 feet (1.8 m) high and 4.5 feet (1.4 m) thick, make it one of the earliest walled settlements in Europe but it is younger than the walled town of Sesklo in Greece from 6800 BC. Uruk in ancient Sumer (Mesopotamia) is one of the world's oldest known walled cities. The Ancient Egyptians also built fortresses on the frontiers of the Nile Valley to protect against invaders from adjacent territories, as well as circle-shaped mud brick walls around their cities. Many of the fortifications of the ancient world were built with mud brick, often leaving them no more than mounds of dirt for today's archeologists. A massive prehistoric stone wall surrounded the ancient temple of Ness of Brodgar 3200 BC in Scotland. Named the \"Great Wall of Brodgar\" it was 4 m (13 ft) thick and 4 m (13 ft) tall. The wall had some symbolic or ritualistic function. The Assyrians deployed large labor forces to build new palaces, temples and defensive walls. === Bronze Age Europe === In Bronze Age Malta, some settlements also began to be fortified. The most notable surviving example is Borġ in-Nadur, where a bastion built in around 1500 BC was found. Exceptions were few—notably, ancient Sparta and ancient Rome did not have walls for a long time, choosing to rely on their militaries for defense instead. Initially, these fortifications were simple constructions of wood and earth, which were later replaced by mixed constructions of stones piled on top of each other without mortar. In ancient Greece, large stone walls had been built in Mycenaean Greece, such as the ancient site of Mycenae (famous for the huge stone blocks of its 'cyclopean' walls). In classical era Greece, the city of Athens built two parallel stone walls, called the Long Walls, that reached their fortified seaport at Piraeus a few miles away. In Central Europe, the Celts built large fortified settlements known as oppida, whose walls seem partially influenced by those built in the Mediterranean. The fortifications were continuously being expanded and improved. Around 600 BC, in Heuneburg, Germany, forts were constructed with a limestone foundation supported by a mudbrick wall approximately 4 meters tall, probably topped by a roofed walkway, thus reaching a total height of 6 meters. The wall was clad with lime plaster, regularly renewed. Towers protruded outwards from it. The Oppidum of Manching (German: Oppidum von Manching) was a large Celtic proto-urban or city-like settlement at modern-day Manching (near Ingolstadt), Bavaria (Germany). The settlement was founded in the 3rd century BC and existed until c. 50–30 BC. It reached its largest extent during the late La Tène period (late 2nd century BC), when it had a size of 380 hectares. At that time, 5,000 to 10,000 people lived within its 7.2 km long walls. The oppidum of Bibracte is another example of a Gaulish fortified settlement. === Bronze and Iron Age Near East === The term casemate wall is used in the archeology of Israel and the wider Near East, having the meaning of a double wall protecting a city or fortress, with transverse walls separating the space between the walls into chambers. These could be used as such, for storage or residential purposes, or could be filled with soil and rocks during siege in order to raise the resistance of the outer wall against battering rams. Originally thought to have been introduced to the region by the Hittites, this has been disproved by the discovery of examples predating their arrival, the earliest being at Ti'inik (Taanach) where such a wall has been dated to the 16th century BC. Casemate walls became a common type of fortification in the Southern Levant between the Middle Bronze Age (MB) and Iron Age II, being more numerous during the Iron Age and peaking in Iron Age II (10th–6th century BC). However, the construction of casemate walls had begun to be replaced by sturdier solid walls by the 9th century BC, probably due the development of more effective battering rams by the Neo-Assyrian Empire. Casemate walls could surround an entire settlement, but most only protected part of it. The three different types included freestanding casemate walls, then integrated ones where the inner wall was part of the outer buildings of the settlement, and finally filled casemate walls, where the rooms between the walls were filled with soil right away, allowing for a quick, but nevertheless stable construction of particularly high walls. === Ancient Rome === The Romans fortified their cities with massive, mortar-bound stone walls. The most famous of these are the largely extant Aurelian Walls of Rome and the Theodosian Walls of Constantinople, together with partial remains elsewhere. These are mostly city gates, like the Porta Nigra in Trier or Newport Arch in Lincoln. Hadrian's Wall was built by the Roman Empire across the width of what is now northern England following a visit by Roman Emperor Hadrian (AD 76–138) in AD 122. === Indian subcontinent === A number of forts dating from the Later Stone Age to the British Raj are found in the mainland Indian subcontinent (modern day India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal). \"Fort\" is the word used in India for all old fortifications. Numerous Indus Valley Civilization sites exhibit evidence of fortifications. By about 3500 BC, hundreds of small farming villages dotted the Indus floodplain. Many of these settlements had fortifications and planned streets. The stone and mud brick houses of Kot Diji were clustered behind massive stone flood dykes and defensive walls, for neighboring communities bickered constantly about the control of prime agricultural land. The fortification varies by site. While Dholavira has stone-built fortification walls, Harrapa is fortified using baked bricks; sites such as Kalibangan exhibit mudbrick fortifications with bastions and Lothal has a quadrangular fortified layout. Evidence also suggested of fortifications in Mohenjo-daro. Even a small town—for instance, Kotada Bhadli, exhibiting sophisticated fortification-like bastions—shows that nearly all major and minor towns of the Indus Valley Civilization were fortified. Forts also appeared in urban cities of the Gangetic valley during the second urbanization period between 600 and 200 BC, and as many as 15 fortification sites have been identified by archeologists throughout the Gangetic valley, such as Kaushambi, Mahasthangarh, Pataliputra, Mathura, Ahichchhatra, Rajgir, and Lauria Nandangarh. The earliest Mauryan period brick fortification occurs in one of the stupa mounds of Lauria Nandangarh, which is 1.6 km in perimeter and oval in plan and encloses a habitation area.Mundigak (c. 2500 BC) in present-day south-east Afghanistan has defensive walls and square bastions of sun dried bricks. India currently has over 180 forts, with the state of Maharashtra alone having over 70 forts, which are also known as durg, many of them built by Shivaji, founder of the Maratha Empire. A large majority of forts in India are in North India. The most notable forts are the Red Fort at Old Delhi, the Red Fort at Agra, the Chittor Fort and Mehrangarh Fort in Rajasthan, the Ranthambhor Fort, Amer Fort and Jaisalmer Fort also in Rajasthan and Gwalior Fort in Madhya Pradesh. Arthashastra, the Indian treatise on military strategy describes six major types of forts differentiated by their major modes of defenses. ==== Sri Lanka ==== Forts in Sri Lanka date back thousands of years, with many being built by Sri Lankan kings. These include several walled cities. With the outset of colonial rule in the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka was occupied by several major colonial empires that from time to time became the dominant power in the Indian Ocean. The colonists built several western-style forts, mostly in and around the coast of the island. The first to build colonial forts in Sri Lanka were the Portuguese; these forts were captured and later expanded by the Dutch. The British occupied these Dutch forts during the Napoleonic wars. Most of the colonial forts were garrisoned up until the early 20th century. The coastal forts had coastal artillery manned by the Ceylon Garrison Artillery during the two world wars. Most of these were abandoned by the military but retained civil administrative officers, while others retained military garrisons, which were more administrative than operational. Some were reoccupied by military units with the escalation of the Sri Lankan Civil War; Jaffna fort, for example, came under siege several times. === China === Large tempered earth (i.e. rammed earth) walls were built in ancient China since the Shang dynasty (c. 1600–1050 BC); the capital at ancient Ao had enormous walls built in this fashion (see siege for more info). Although stone walls were built in China during the Warring States (481–221 BC), mass conversion to stone architecture did not begin in earnest until the Tang dynasty (618–907 AD). The Great Wall of China had been built since the Qin dynasty (221–207 BC), although its present form was mostly an engineering feat and remodeling of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644 AD). In addition to the Great Wall, a number of Chinese cities also employed the use of defensive walls to defend their cities. Notable Chinese city walls include the city walls of Hangzhou, Nanking, the Old City of Shanghai, Suzhou, Xi'an and the walled villages of Hong Kong. The famous walls of the Forbidden City in Beijing were established in the early 15th century by the Yongle Emperor. The Forbidden City made up the inner portion of the Beijing city fortifications. === Philippines === ==== Spanish colonial fortifications ==== During the Spanish Era several forts and outposts were built throughout the archipelago. Most notable is Intramuros, the old walled city of Manila located along the southern bank of the Pasig River. The historic city was home to centuries-old churches, schools, convents, government buildings and residences, the best collection of Spanish colonial architecture before much of it was destroyed by the bombs of World War II. Of all the buildings within the 67-acre city, only one building, the San Agustin Church, survived the war. Partial listing of Spanish forts: Intramuros, Manila Cuartel de Santo Domingo, Santa Rosa, Laguna Fuerza de Cuyo, Cuyo, Palawan Fuerza de Cagayancillo, Cagayancillo, Palawan Real Fuerza de Nuestra Señora del Pilar de Zaragoza, Zamboanga City Fuerza de San Felipe, Cavite City Fuerza de San Pedro, Cebu Fuerte de la Concepcion y del Triunfo, Ozamiz, Misamis Occidental Fuerza de San Antonio Abad, Manila Fuerza de Pikit, Pikit, Cotabato Fuerza de Santiago, Romblon, Romblon Fuerza de Jolo, Jolo, Sulu Fuerza de Masbate, Masbate Fuerza de Bongabong, Bongabong, Oriental Mindoro Cotta de Dapitan, Dapitan, Zamboanga del Norte Fuerte de Alfonso XII, Tukuran, Zamboanga del Sur Fuerza de Bacolod, Bacolod, Lanao del Norte Guinsiliban Watchtower, Guinsiliban, Camiguin Laguindingan Watchtower, Laguindingan, Misamis Oriental Kutang San Diego, Gumaca, Quezon Baluarte Luna, Luna, La Union ==== Local fortifications ==== The Ivatan people of the northern islands of Batanes built their so-called idjang on hills and elevated areas to protect themselves during times of war. These fortifications were likened to European castles because of their purpose. Usually, the only entrance to the castles would be via a rope ladder that would only be lowered for the villagers and could be kept away when invaders arrived. The Igorots built forts made of stone walls that averaged several meters in width and about two to three times the width in height around 2000 BC. The Muslim Filipinos of the south built strong fortresses called kota or moong to protect their communities. Usually, many of the occupants of these kotas are entire families rather than just warriors. Lords often had their own kotas to assert their right to rule, it served not only as a military installation but as a palace for the local Lord. It is said that at the height of the Maguindanao Sultanate's power, they blanketed the areas around Western Mindanao with kotas and other fortifications to block the Spanish advance into the region. These kotas were usually made of stone and bamboo or other light materials and surrounded by trench networks. As a result, some of these kotas were burned easily or destroyed. With further Spanish campaigns in the region, the sultanate was subdued and a majority of kotas dismantled or destroyed. kotas were not only used by the Muslims as defense against Spaniards and other foreigners, renegades and rebels also built fortifications in defiance of other chiefs in the area. During the American occupation, rebels built strongholds and the datus, rajahs, or sultans often built and reinforced their kotas in a desperate bid to maintain rule over their subjects and their land. Many of these forts were also destroyed by American expeditions, as a result, very very few kotas still stand to this day. Notable kotas: Kota Selurong: an outpost of the Bruneian Empire in Luzon, later became the City of Manila. Kuta Wato/Kota Bato: Literally translates to \"stone fort\" the first known stone fortification in the country, its ruins exist as the \"Kutawato Cave Complex\" Kota Sug/Jolo: The capital and seat of the Sultanate of Sulu. When it was occupied by the Spaniards in the 1870s they converted the kota into the world's smallest walled city. === Pre-Islamic Arabia === ==== During Muhammad's lifetime ==== During Muhammad's era in Arabia, many tribes made use of fortifications. In the Battle of the Trench, the largely outnumbered defenders of Medina, mainly Muslims led by Islamic prophet Muhammad, dug a trench, which together with Medina's natural fortifications, rendered the confederate cavalry (consisting of horses and camels) useless, locking the two sides in a stalemate. Hoping to make several attacks at once, the confederates persuaded the Medina-allied Banu Qurayza to attack the city from the south. However, Muhammad's diplomacy derailed the negotiations, and broke up the confederacy against him. The well-organized defenders, the sinking of confederate morale, and poor weather conditions caused the siege to end in a fiasco. During the Siege of Ta'if in January 630, Muhammad ordered his followers to attack enemies who fled from the Battle of Hunayn and sought refuge in the fortress of Taif. === Islamic world === === Africa === The entire city of Kerma in Nubia (present day Sudan) was encompassed by fortified walls surrounded by a ditch. Archeology has revealed various Bronze Age bastions and foundations constructed of stone together with either baked or unfired brick. The walls of Benin are described as the world's second longest man-made structure, as well as the most extensive earthwork in the world, by the Guinness Book of Records, 1974. The walls may have been constructed between the thirteenth and mid-fifteenth century CE or, during the first millennium CE. Strong citadels were also built other in areas of Africa. Yorubaland for example had several sites surrounded by the full range of earthworks and ramparts seen elsewhere, and sited on ground. This improved defensive potential—such as hills and ridges. Yoruba fortifications were often protected with a double wall of trenches and ramparts, and in the Congo forests concealed ditches and paths, along with the main works, often bristled with rows of sharpened stakes. Inner defenses were laid out to blunt an enemy penetration with a maze of defensive walls allowing for entrapment and crossfire on opposing forces. A military tactic of the Ashanti was to create powerful log stockades at key points. This was employed in later wars against the British to block British advances. Some of these fortifications were over a hundred yards long, with heavy parallel tree trunks. They were impervious to destruction by artillery fire. Behind these stockades, numerous Ashanti soldiers were mobilized to check enemy movement. While formidable in construction, many of these strongpoints failed because Ashanti guns, gunpowder and bullets were poor, and provided little sustained killing power in defense. Time and time again British troops overcame or bypassed the stockades by mounting old-fashioned bayonet charges, after laying down some covering fire. Defensive works were of importance in the tropical African Kingdoms. In the Kingdom of Kongo field fortifications were characterized by trenches and low earthen embankments. Such strongpoints ironically, sometimes held up much better against European cannon than taller, more imposing structures. === Medieval Europe === Roman forts and hill forts were the main antecedents of castles in Europe, which emerged in the 9th century in the Carolingian Empire. The Early Middle Ages saw the creation of some towns built around castles. These cities were only rarely protected by simple stone walls and more usually by a combination of both walls and ditches. From the 12th century, hundreds of settlements of all sizes were founded all across Europe, which very often obtained the right of fortification soon afterward. The founding of urban centers was an important means of territorial expansion and many cities, especially in eastern Europe, were founded precisely for this purpose during the period of Ostsiedlung. These cities are easy to recognize due to their regular layout and large market spaces. The fortifications of these settlements were continuously improved to reflect the current level of military development. During the Renaissance era, the Venetian Republic raised great walls around cities, and the finest examples, among others, are in Nicosia (Cyprus), Rocca di Manerba del Garda (Lombardy), and Palmanova (Italy), or Dubrovnik (Croatia), which proved to be futile against attacks but still stand to this day. Unlike the Venetians, the Ottomans used to build smaller fortifications but in greater numbers, and only rarely fortified entire settlements such as Počitelj, Vratnik, and Jajce in Bosnia. === Development after introduction of firearms === Medieval-style fortifications were largely made obsolete by the arrival of cannons on the 14th century battlefield. Fortifications in the age of black powder evolved into much lower structures with greater use of ditches and earth ramparts that would absorb and disperse the energy of cannon fire. Walls exposed to direct cannon fire were very vulnerable, so were sunk into ditches fronted by earth slopes. This placed a heavy emphasis on the geometry of the fortification to allow defensive cannonry interlocking fields of fire to cover all approaches to the lower and thus more vulnerable walls. The evolution of this new style of fortification can be seen in transitional forts such as Sarzanello in North West Italy which was built between 1492 and 1502. Sarzanello consists of both crenellated walls with towers typical of the medieval period but also has a ravelin like angular gun platform screening one of the curtain walls which is protected from flanking fire from the towers of the main part of the fort. Another example is the fortifications of Rhodes which were frozen in 1522 so that Rhodes is the only European walled town that still shows the transition between the classical medieval fortification and the modern ones. A manual about the construction of fortification was published by Giovanni Battista Zanchi in 1554. Fortifications also extended in depth, with protected batteries for defensive cannonry, to allow them to engage attacking cannons to keep them at a distance and prevent them from bearing directly on the vulnerable walls. The result was star shaped fortifications with tier upon tier of hornworks and bastions, of which Fort Bourtange is an excellent example. There are also extensive fortifications from this era in the Nordic states and in Britain, the fortifications of Berwick-upon-Tweed and the harbor archipelago of Suomenlinna at Helsinki being fine examples. === 19th century === During the 18th century, it was found that the continuous enceinte, or main defensive enclosure of a bastion fortress, could not be made large enough to accommodate the enormous field armies which were increasingly being employed in Europe; neither could the defenses be constructed far enough away from the fortress town to protect the inhabitants from bombardment by the besiegers, the range of whose guns was steadily increasing as better manufactured weapons were introduced. Therefore, since refortifying the Prussian fortress cities of Koblenz and Köln after 1815, the principle of the ring fortress or girdle fortress was used: forts, each several hundred meters out from the original enceinte, were carefully sited so as to make best use of the terrain and to be capable of mutual support with neighboring forts. Gone were citadels surrounding towns: forts were to be moved some distance away from cities to keep the enemy at a distance so their artillery could not bombard said urbanized settlements. From now on a ring of forts were to be built at a spacing that would allow them to effectively cover the intervals between them. The arrival of explosive shells in the 19th century led to yet another stage in the evolution of fortification. Star forts did not fare well against the effects of high explosives and the intricate arrangements of bastions, flanking batteries and the carefully constructed lines of fire for the defending cannon could be rapidly disrupted by explosive shells. Worse, the large open ditches surrounding forts of this type were an integral part of the defensive scheme, as was the covered way at the edge of the counterscarp. The ditch was extremely vulnerable to bombardment with explosive shells. In response, military engineers evolved the polygonal style of fortification. The ditch became deep and vertically sided, cut directly into the native rock or soil, laid out as a series of straight lines creating the central fortified area that gives this style of fortification its name. Wide enough to be an impassable barrier for attacking troops but narrow enough to be a difficult target for enemy shellfire, the ditch was swept by fire from defensive blockhouses set in the ditch as well as firing positions cut into the outer face of the ditch itself. The profile of the fort became very low indeed, surrounded outside the ditch covered by caponiers by a gently sloping open area so as to eliminate possible cover for enemy forces, while the fort itself provided a minimal target for enemy fire. The entrypoint became a sunken gatehouse in the inner face of the ditch, reached by a curving ramp that gave access to the gate via a rolling bridge that could be withdrawn into the gatehouse. Much of the fort moved underground. Deep passages and tunnel networks now connected the blockhouses and firing points in the ditch to the fort proper, with magazines and machine rooms deep under the surface. The guns, however, were often mounted in open emplacements and protected only by a parapet; both in order to keep a lower profile and also because experience with guns in closed casemates had seen them put out of action by rubble as their own casemates were collapsed around them. The new forts abandoned the principle of the bastion, which had also been made obsolete by advances in arms. The outline was a much-simplified polygon, surrounded by a ditch. These forts, built in masonry and shaped stone, were designed to shelter their garrison against bombardment. One organizing feature of the new system involved the construction of two defensive curtains: an outer line of forts, backed by an inner ring or line at critical points of terrain or junctions (see, for example, Séré de Rivières system in France). Traditional fortification however continued to be applied by European armies engaged in warfare in colonies established in Africa against lightly armed attackers from amongst the indigenous population. A relatively small number of defenders in a fort impervious to primitive weaponry could hold out against high odds, the only constraint being the supply of ammunition. === 20th and 21st centuries === Steel-and-concrete fortifications were common during the 19th and early 20th centuries. However, the advances in modern warfare since World War I have made large-scale fortifications obsolete in most situations. In the 1930s and 1940s, some fortifications were built with designs taking into consideration the new threat of aerial warfare, such as Fort Campbell in Malta. Despite this, only underground bunkers are still able to provide some protection in modern wars. Many historical fortifications were demolished during the modern age, but a considerable number survive as popular tourist destinations and prominent local landmarks today. The downfall of permanent fortifications had two causes: The ever-escalating power, speed, and reach of artillery and airpower meant that almost any target that could be located could be destroyed if sufficient force were massed against it. As such, the more resources a defender devoted to reinforcing a fortification, the more combat power that fortification justified being devoted to destroying it, if the fortification's destruction was demanded by an attacker's strategy. From World War II, bunker busters were used against fortifications. By 1950, nuclear weapons were capable of destroying entire cities and producing dangerous radiation. This led to the creation of civilian nuclear air raid shelters. The second weakness of permanent fortification was its very permanency. Because of this, it was often easier to go around a fortification and, with the rise of mobile warfare in the beginning of World War II, this became a viable offensive choice. When a defensive line was too extensive to be entirely bypassed, massive offensive might could be massed against one part of the line allowing a breakthrough, after which the rest of the line could be bypassed. Such was the fate of the many defensive lines built before and during World War II, such as the Siegfried Line, the Stalin Line, and the Atlantic Wall. This was not the case with the Maginot Line; it was designed to force the Germans to invade other countries (Belgium or Switzerland) to go around it, and was successful in that sense. Instead field fortification rose to dominate defensive action. Unlike the trench warfare which dominated World War I, these defenses were more temporary in nature. This was an advantage because since it was less extensive it formed a less obvious target for enemy force to be directed against. If sufficient power were massed against one point to penetrate it, the forces based there could be withdrawn and the line could be reestablished relatively quickly. Instead of a supposedly impenetrable defensive line, such fortifications emphasized defense in depth, so that as defenders were forced to pull back or were overrun, the lines of defenders behind them could take over the defense. Because the mobile offensives practiced by both sides usually focused on avoiding the strongest points of a defensive line, these defenses were usually relatively thin and spread along the length of a line. The defense was usually not equally strong throughout, however. The strength of the defensive line in an area varied according to how rapidly an attacking force could progress in the terrain that was being defended—both the terrain the defensive line was built on and the ground behind it that an attacker might hope to break out into. This was both for reasons of the strategic value of the ground, and its defensive value. This was possible because while offensive tactics were focused on mobility, so were defensive tactics. The dug-in defenses consisted primarily of infantry and antitank guns. Defending tanks and tank destroyers would be concentrated in mobile brigades behind the defensive line. If a major offensive was launched against a point in the line, mobile reinforcements would be sent to reinforce that part of the line that was in danger of failing. Thus the defensive line could be relatively thin because the bulk of the fighting power of the defenders was not concentrated in the line itself but rather in the mobile reserves. A notable exception to this rule was seen in the defensive lines at the Battle of Kursk during World War II, where German forces deliberately attacked the strongest part of the Soviet defenses, seeking to crush them utterly. The terrain that was being defended was of primary importance because open terrain that tanks could move over quickly made possible rapid advances into the defenders' rear areas that were very dangerous to the defenders. Thus such terrain had to be defended at all costs. In addition, since in theory the defensive line only had to hold out long enough for mobile reserves to reinforce it, terrain that did not permit rapid advance could be held more weakly because the enemy's advance into it would be slower, giving the defenders more time to reinforce that point in the line. For example, the Battle of the Hurtgen Forest in Germany during the closing stages of World War II is an excellent example of how difficult terrain could be used to the defenders' advantage. After World War II, intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of reaching much of the way around the world were developed, so speed became an essential characteristic of the strongest militaries and defenses. Missile silos were developed, so missiles could be fired from the middle of a country and hit cities and targets in another country, and airplanes (and aircraft carriers) became major defenses and offensive weapons (leading to an expansion of the use of airports and airstrips as fortifications). Mobile defenses could be had underwater, too, in the form of ballistic missile submarines capable of firing submarine launched ballistic missiles. Some bunkers in the mid to late 20th century came to be buried deep inside mountains and prominent rocks, such as Gibraltar and the Cheyenne Mountain Complex. On the ground itself, minefields have been used as hidden defenses in modern warfare, often remaining long after the wars that produced them have ended. Demilitarized zones along borders are arguably another type of fortification, although a passive kind, providing a buffer between potentially hostile militaries. === Military airfields === Military airfields offer a fixed \"target rich\" environment for even relatively small enemy forces, using hit-and-run tactics by ground forces, stand-off attacks (mortars and rockets), air attacks, or ballistic missiles. Key targets—aircraft, munitions, fuel, and vital technical personnel—can be protected by fortifications. Aircraft can be protected by revetments, hesco barriers, hardened aircraft shelters and underground hangars which will protect from many types of attack. Larger aircraft types tend to be based outside the operational theater. Munition storage follows safety rules which use fortifications (bunkers and bunds) to provide protection against accident and chain reactions (sympathetic detonations). Weapons for rearming aircraft can be stored in small fortified expense stores closer to the aircraft. At Biên Hòa, South Vietnam, on the morning of May 16, 1965, as aircraft were being refueled and armed, a chain reaction explosion destroyed 13 aircraft, killed 34 personnel, and injured over 100; this, along with damage and losses of aircraft to enemy attack (by both infiltration and stand-off attacks), led to the construction of revetments and shelters to protect aircraft throughout South Vietnam. Aircrew and ground personnel will need protection during enemy attacks and fortifications range from culvert section \"duck and cover\" shelters to permanent air raid shelters. Soft locations with high personnel densities such as accommodation and messing facilities can have limited protection by placing prefabricated concrete walls or barriers around them, examples of barriers are Jersey Barriers, T Barriers or Splinter Protection Units (SPUs). Older fortification may prove useful such as the old 'Yugo' pyramid shelters built in the 1980s which were used by US personnel on 8 Jan 2020 when Iran fired 11 ballistic missiles at Ayn al-Asad Airbase in Iraq. Fuel is volatile and has to comply with rules for storage which provide protection against accidents. Fuel in underground bulk fuel installations is well protected though valves and controls are vulnerable to enemy action. Above-ground tanks can be susceptible to attack. Ground support equipment will need to be protected by fortifications to be usable after an enemy attack. Permanent (concrete) guard fortifications are safer, stronger, last longer and are more cost-effective than sandbag fortifications. Prefabricated positions can be made from concrete culvert sections. The British Yarnold Bunker is made from sections of a concrete pipe. Guard towers provide an increased field of view but a lower level of protection. Dispersal and camouflage of assets can supplement fortifications against some forms of airfield attack. ==== Counterinsurgency ==== Just as in colonial periods, comparatively obsolete fortifications are still used for low intensity conflicts. Such fortifications range in size from small patrol bases or forward operating bases up to huge airbases such as Camp Bastion/Leatherneck in Afghanistan. Much like in the 18th and 19th century, because the enemy is not a powerful military force with the heavy weaponry required to destroy fortifications, walls of gabion, sandbag or even simple mud can provide protection against small arms and antitank weapons—although such fortifications are still vulnerable to mortar and artillery fire. == Forts == Forts in modern American usage often refer to space set aside by governments for a permanent military facility; these often do not have any actual fortifications, and can have specializations (military barracks, administration, medical facilities, or intelligence). However, there are some modern fortifications that are referred to as forts. These are typically small semipermanent fortifications. In urban combat, they are built by upgrading existing structures such as houses or public buildings. In field warfare they are often log, sandbag or gabion type construction. Such forts are typically only used in low-level conflicts, such as counterinsurgency conflicts or very low-level conventional conflicts, such as the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, which saw the use of log forts for use by forward platoons and companies. The reason for this is that static above-ground forts cannot survive modern direct or indirect fire weapons larger than mortars, RPGs and small arms. == Prisons and others == Fortifications designed to keep the inhabitants of a facility in rather than attacker out can also be found, in prisons, concentration camps, and other such facilities. Those are covered in other articles, as most prisons and concentration camps are not primarily military forts (although forts, camps, and garrison towns have been used as prisons and/or concentration camps; such as Theresienstadt, Guantanamo Bay detention camp and the Tower of London for example). == Field fortifications == == Notes == == References == This article incorporates text from a publication now in the public domain: Jackson, Louis Charles (1911). \"Fortification and Siegecraft\".

         "Ellagic acid is a polyphenol found in numerous fruits and vegetables. It is the dilactone of hexahydroxydiphenic acid. == Name == The name comes from the French term acide ellagique, from the word galle spelled backward because it can be obtained from noix de galle (galls), and to distinguish it from acide gallique (gallic acid). The molecule structure resembles to that of two gallic acid molecules being assembled \"head to tail\" and bound together by a C–C bond (as in biphenyl, or in diphenic acid) and two lactone links (cyclic carboxylic esters). == Metabolism == === Biosynthesis === Plants produce ellagic acid from hydrolysis of tannins such as ellagitannin and geraniin. === Biodegradation === Urolithins are gut flora human metabolites of dietary ellagic acid derivatives. Ellagic acid has low bioavailability, with 90% remaining unabsorbed from the intestines until metabolized by microflora to the more bioavailable urolithins. == History == Ellagic acid was first discovered by chemist Henri Braconnot in 1831. Maximilian Nierenstein prepared this substance from algarobilla, dividivi, oak bark, pomegranate, myrabolams, and valonea in 1905. He also suggested its formation from galloyl-glycine by Penicillium in 1915. Julius Löwe was the first person to synthesize ellagic acid by heating gallic acid with arsenic acid or silver oxide. == Natural occurrences == Ellagic acid is found in edible nuts. It is also found in oak species such as the North American white oak (Quercus alba) and European red oak (Quercus robur). The macrophyte Myriophyllum spicatum produces ellagic acid. Ellagic acid can be found in the medicinal mushroom Phellinus linteus. === In food === The highest levels of ellagic acid are found in raw chestnuts, walnuts, pecans, cranberries, raspberries, strawberries, and grapes, as well as distilled beverages. It is also found in peaches and pomegranates. == Research and health claims == Ellagic acid has been marketed as a dietary supplement with various claimed benefits against cancer, heart disease, and other diseases. In the 21st century, numerous U.S.-based supplement companies received FDA warning letters for promoting ellagic acid with false anti-disease claims that violate the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Ellagic acid has been identified by the FDA as a \"fake cancer 'cure'\". There is no scientific evidence to support the claims that ellagic acid can treat or prevent cancer. == See also == List of ineffective cancer treatments == References ==",

         " Dynogen Pharmaceuticals Inc, under license from Mitsubishi Pharma Corp, is developing pumosetrag (MKC-733, DDP-733), an orally available gastroprokinetic agent and locally acting 5-HT3 partial agonist, for the potential treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) with constipation and nocturnal gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In September 2005, Dynogen commenced a phase II proof-of-concept trial of pumosetrag in IBS with constipation; positive results were reported in February 2007 and a phase IIb trial was to start in the fourth quarter of 2007. In September 2006, the company had initiated a phase Ib trial in nocturnal GERD. Low basal lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure and transient LES relaxations are major causes of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Pumosetrag, a novel selective partial 5HT3 receptor agonist, showed a promising effect on reducing reflux events in health. We aimed to evaluate the effect of pumosetrag on changes in reflux episodes, lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP), and specific symptoms in patients with GERD receiving a refluxogenic meal. Patients with GERD, who developed heartburn and/or regurgitation after ingestion of a refluxogenic meal, were randomized to 1 of 3 dose levels of pumosetrag (0.2, 0.5, or 0.8 mg) or placebo. Before and after 7 days of treatment, patients underwent manometry, intraesophageal multichannel, intraluminal impedance and pH after a standard refluxogenic meal. A total of 223 patients with GERD [125 (56%) women, mean (SD) age = 36 (12) years] were enrolled. No overall treatment effects were detected for the total number of reflux episodes (acidic and weakly acidic) (p > 0.5); however, significant treatment effects (p < 0.05) on the number of acid reflux episodes were observed with lower values on pumosetrag 0.2 mg (10.8 ± 1.1), 0.5 mg (9.5 ± 1.1), and 0.8 mg (9.9 ± 1.1) compared with placebo (13.3 ± 1.1). Significant treatment effects (p < 0.05) were also observed for the percentage of time pH was <4, with less time for pumosetrag at 0.5 mg (10%) and 0.8 mg (10%) compared with placebo (16%). In GERD, the partial 5HT3 agonist pumosetrag significantly reduced the rate of acid reflux events but did not result in a significant change in LESP or symptomatic improvement over a 1-week treatment period.",

         " To assess the efficacy and tolerability of acetyl-L-carnitine (levacecarnine; LAC) versus placebo in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy, mainly by evaluating the effects of treatment on electrophysiological parameters and pain symptoms. This was a multicentre (n = 20), randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. 333 patients meeting clinical and/or neurophysiological criteria for diabetic neuropathy were enrolled. Patients were randomised to treatment with LAC or placebo. LAC (or placebo) was started intramuscularly at a dosage of 1000 mg/day for 10 days and continued orally at a dosage of 2000 mg/day for the remainder of the study (355 days). MAIN OUTCOME PARAMETERS AND RESULTS: The main efficacy parameter was the effect of treatment on 6- and 12-month changes from baseline in nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and amplitude in the sensory (ulnar, sural and median) and motor (median, ulnar and peroneal) nerves. The effect of treatment on pain was also evaluated by means of a visual analogue scale (VAS). Among the 294 patients with impaired electrophysiological parameters at baseline, those treated with LAC showed a statistically significant improvement in mean NCV and amplitude compared with placebo (p < 0.01). The greatest changes in NCV (at 12 months) were observed in the sensory sural nerve (7 m/sec in the LAC group vs +1.0 m/sec in the placebo group), sensory ulnar nerve (+2.9 vs +0.1 m/sec, respectively) and motor peroneal nerve (+2.7 vs -0.2 m/sec), whereas the greatest changes in amplitude were recorded in the motor peroneal nerve (+2.2 vs +0.1 mV). After 12 months of treatment, mean VAS scores for pain were significantly reduced from baseline by 39% in LAC-treated patients (p < 0.0 vs baseline) compared with 8% in placebo recipients. LAC was well tolerated over the study period. LAC was effective and well tolerated in improving neurophysiological parameters and in reducing pain over a 1-year period. LAC is, therefore, a promising treatment option in patients with diabetic neuropathy.",

N-Acetyl-DL-tryptophan and the internal standard, N-formyl-DL-tryptophan, were separated by liquid chromatography on a reversed-phase column with UV detection at 280 nm. Deproteinization and extraction were carried out with methanol. The extraction recovery at the level of 4.9 mM was 92.5 +/- 2.5% (S.D.) (n = 10), and the average coefficient of variation (C.V.) for replicate analyses of albumin solutions (mean = 2.57, 10.44 and 17.10 mM) was 1.10% (n = 27). Octanoic acid was determined gas chromatographically as its methyl ester, with nonanoic acid as the internal standard. The sample pretreatment included acidification, extraction with hexane and derivatization with methanol-sulphuric acid. The relative recovery from albumin solutions was 89.7 +/- 5.8% (S.D.) (n = 6), and replicate determinations of the compound yielded a C.V. of 5.5% (mean = 14.82 mM, n = 9). Methods were developed for the determination of octanoic acid and N-acetyl-DL-tryptophan, which are used as stabilizers in the human blood-derived therapeutic products normal serum albumin and plasma protein fraction. The method for octanoic acid uses GC; quantitation is achieved using heptanoic acid as the internal standard. The method for N-acetyl-DL-tryptophan is based on UV spectrophotometry of the acid-soluble fraction remaining after precipitation of the protein (epsilon 280 for N-acetyl-DL-tryptophan, 5250). The coefficient of variation for replicate determinations of octanoic acid averaged 3.9% (range 2.1-5.5%); that of N-acetyl-DL-tryptophan averaged 1.9% (range 0.5-4.0%). Use of these methods for the analysis of 138 lots of commercial products for octanoic acid and 159 lots for N-acetyl-DL-tryptophan showed that the stabilizer contents of 132 and 158 of these lots, respectively, were within 20% of the value indicated on the product label.",

         "Nortriptyline, sold under the brand name Aventyl, among others, is a tricyclic antidepressant. This medicine is also sometimes used for neuropathic pain, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), smoking cessation and anxiety. Its use for young people with depression and other psychiatric disorders may be limited due to increased suicidality in the 18–24 population initiating treatment. Nortriptyline is not a preferred treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or smoking cessation. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include dry mouth, constipation, blurry vision, sleepiness, low blood pressure with standing, and weakness. Serious side effects may include seizures, an increased risk of suicide in those less than 25 years of age, urinary retention, glaucoma, mania, and a number of heart issues. Nortriptyline may cause problems if taken during pregnancy. Use during breastfeeding appears to be relatively safe. It is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) and is believed to work by altering levels of serotonin and norepinephrine. Nortriptyline was approved for medical use in the United States in 1964. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 191st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Nortriptyline is used to treat depression. A level between 50 and 150 ng/mL of nortriptyline in the blood generally corresponds with an antidepressant effect. It is also used off-label for the treatment of panic disorder, ADHD, irritable bowel syndrome, tobacco-cessation, migraine prophylaxis and chronic pain or neuralgia modification, particularly temporomandibular joint disorder. === Irritable bowel syndrome === Nortriptyline has also been used as an off-label treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). == Contraindications == Nortriptyline should not be used in the acute recovery phase after myocardial infarction (heart attack). Use of tricyclic antidepressants along with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), linezolid, or IV methylene blue are contraindicated as it can cause an increased risk of developing serotonin syndrome. Closer monitoring is required for those with a history of cardiovascular disease, stroke, glaucoma, or seizures, as well as in persons with hyperthyroidism or receiving thyroid hormones. == Side effects == The most common side effects include dry mouth, sedation, constipation, increased appetite, blurred vision and tinnitus. An occasional side effect is a rapid or irregular heartbeat. Alcohol may exacerbate some of its side effects. == Overdose == The symptoms and the treatment of an overdose are generally the same as for the other tricyclic antidepressants, including anticholinergic effects, serotonin syndrome and adverse cardiac effects. TCAs, particularly nortriptyline, have a relatively narrow therapeutic index, which increase the chance of an overdose (both accidental and intentional). Symptoms of overdose include: irregular heartbeat, seizures, coma, confusion, hallucination, widened pupils, drowsiness, agitation, fever, low body temperature, stiff muscles and vomiting. == Interactions == Excessive consumption of alcohol in combination with nortriptyline therapy may have a potentiating effect, which may lead to the danger of increased suicidal attempts or overdosage, especially in patients with histories of emotional disturbances or suicidal ideation. It may interact with the following drugs: heart rhythm medications such as flecainide (Tambocor), propafenone (Rhythmol), or quinidine (Cardioquin, Quinidex, Quinaglute) cimetidine guanethidine reserpine == Pharmacology == Nortriptyline is a strong norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and a moderate serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Additionally, nortriptyline inhibits the activity of histamine and acetylcholine. Its pharmacologic profile is as the table shows with (inhibition or antagonism of all sites). === Pharmacodynamics === Nortriptyline is an active metabolite of amitriptyline by demethylation in the liver. Chemically, it is a secondary amine dibenzocycloheptene and pharmacologically it is classed as a first-generation antidepressant. Nortriptyline may also have a sleep-improving effect due to antagonism of the H1 and 5-HT2A receptors. In the short term, however, nortriptyline may disturb sleep due to its activating effect. In one study, nortriptyline had the highest affinity for the dopamine transporter among the tricyclic antidepressants (KD = 1,140 nM) besides amineptine (a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor), although its affinity for this transporter was still 261- and 63-fold lower than for the norepinephrine and serotonin transporters (KD = 4.37 and 18 nM, respectively). === Pharmacogenetics === Nortriptyline is metabolized in the liver by the hepatic enzyme CYP2D6, and genetic variations within the gene coding for this enzyme can affect its metabolism, leading to changes in the concentrations of the drug in the body. Increased concentrations of nortriptyline may increase the risk for side effects, including anticholinergic and nervous system adverse effects, while decreased concentrations may reduce the drug's efficacy. Individuals can be categorized into different types of CYP2D6 metabolizers depending on which genetic variations they carry. These metabolizer types include poor, intermediate, extensive, and ultrarapid metabolizers. Most individuals (about 77–92%) are extensive metabolizers, and have \"normal\" metabolism of nortriptyline. Poor and intermediate metabolizers have reduced metabolism of the drug as compared to extensive metabolizers; patients with these metabolizer types may have an increased probability of experiencing side effects. Ultrarapid metabolizers use nortriptyline much faster than extensive metabolizers; patients with this metabolizer type may have a greater chance of experiencing pharmacological failure. The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium recommends avoiding nortriptyline in persons who are CYP2D6 ultrarapid or poor metabolizers, due to the risk of a lack of efficacy and side effects, respectively. A reduction in starting dose is recommended for patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers. If use of nortriptyline is warranted, therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to guide dose adjustments. The Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group recommends reducing the dose of nortriptyline in CYP2D6 poor or intermediate metabolizers, and selecting an alternative drug or increasing the dose in ultrarapid metabolizers. == Chemistry == Nortriptyline is a tricyclic compound, specifically a dibenzocycloheptadiene, and possesses three rings fused together with a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzocycloheptadiene tricyclic antidepressants include amitriptyline (N-methylnortriptyline), protriptyline, and butriptyline. Nortriptyline is a secondary amine tricyclic antidepressant, with its N-methylated parent amitriptyline being a tertiary amine. Other secondary amine tricyclic antidepressants include desipramine and protriptyline. The chemical name of nortriptyline is 3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5-ylidene)-N-methyl-1-propanamine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C19H21N1 with a molecular weight of 263.384 g/mol. The drug is used commercially mostly as the hydrochloride salt; the free base form is used rarely. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 72-69-5 and of the hydrochloride is 894-71-3. == History == Nortriptyline was developed by Geigy. It first appeared in the literature in 1962 and was patented the same year. The drug was first introduced for the treatment of depression in 1963. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Nortriptyline is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, while nortriptyline hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Its generic name in Spanish and Italian and its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana are nortriptilina, in German is nortriptylin, and in Latin is nortriptylinum. === Brand names === Brand names of nortriptyline include Allegron, Aventyl, Noritren, Norpress, Nortrilen, Norventyl, Norzepine, Pamelor, and Sensival, among many others. == Research == Although not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for neuropathic pain, randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of tricyclic antidepressants for the treatment of this condition in both depressed and non-depressed individuals. In 2010, an evidence-based guideline sponsored by the International Association for the Study of Pain recommended nortriptyline as a first-line medication for neuropathic pain. However, in a 2015 Cochrane systematic review the authors did not recommend nortriptyline as a first-line agent for neuropathic pain. It may be effective in the treatment of tobacco-cessation. == References ==",

         "Tamoxifen, sold under the brand name Nolvadex among others, is a selective estrogen receptor modulator used to prevent breast cancer in women and men. It is also being studied for other types of cancer. It has been used for Albright syndrome. Tamoxifen is typically taken daily by mouth for five years for breast cancer. Serious side effects include a small increased risk of uterine cancer, stroke, vision problems, and pulmonary embolism. Common side effects include irregular periods, weight loss, and hot flashes. It may cause harm to the baby if taken during pregnancy or breastfeeding. It is a selective estrogen-receptor modulator (SERM) and works by decreasing the growth of breast cancer cells. It is a member of the triphenylethylene group of compounds. Tamoxifen was initially made in 1962, by chemist Dora Richardson. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Tamoxifen is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 317th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 900 thousand prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Dysmenorrhea === Dysmenorrhea is the term for menstrual pain, usually centered in the lower abdomen but often spreading to the back and inner thighs. It is a common gynecological condition that can seriously affect daily activities and well-being. Tamoxifen has been identified and used to effectively improve blood flow, reduce uterine contractility and pain in dysmenorrhea patients. === Breast cancer === Tamoxifen is used for the treatment of both early and advanced estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive or ER+) breast cancer in pre- and postmenopausal women. Tamoxifen increases the risk of postmenopausal bleeding, endometrial polyps, hyperplasia, and endometrial cancer; using tamoxifen with an intrauterine system releasing levonorgestrel might increase vaginal bleeding after 1 to 2 years, but reduces somewhat endometrial polyps and hyperplasia, but not necessarily endometrial cancer. Additionally, it is the most common hormone treatment for male breast cancer. It is also approved by the FDA for the prevention of breast cancer in women at high risk of developing the disease. The effectiveness of tamoxifen is primarily influenced by estrogen receptor (ER) status, which was the key predictor of the proportional benefits observed. It has been further approved for the reduction of contralateral (in the opposite breast) cancer. Five years of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment significantly lowers the 15-year risk of breast cancer recurrence and mortality. The overall use of tamoxifen is recommended for 10 years. In 2006, the large STAR clinical study concluded that raloxifene is also effective in reducing the incidence of breast cancer. Updated results after an average of 6.75 years of follow up found that raloxifene retains 76% of tamoxifen's effectiveness in preventing invasive breast cancer, with 45% fewer uterine cancers and 25% fewer blood clots in women taking raloxifene than in women taking tamoxifen. === Infertility === Tamoxifen is used for ovulation induction to treat infertility in women with anovulatory disorders. It is given at days three to seven of a woman's cycle. Tamoxifen improves fertility in males with infertility by disinhibiting the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis) via ER antagonism and thereby increasing the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and increasing testicular testosterone production. Some animal studies have suggested tamoxifen could have negative effects on sperm quality and prostatic and gonadal health. === Gynecomastia === Benign enlargement of the male breast, whether asymptomatic or painful, is a common condition thought to result from an increased estrogen/testosterone ratio or from heightened estrogenic or reduced androgenic activity via receptor interactions.Tamoxifen is used to prevent and treat gynecomastia. It is taken as a preventative measure in small doses, or used at the onset of any symptoms such as nipple soreness or sensitivity. Current treatments typically involve pain relief through medication or surgery. However, targeting the underlying estrogenic stimulation may offer a more specific therapeutic approach. In a double-blind crossover study, patients were given either a placebo or tamoxifen (10 mg orally twice daily) for one month, in random order. Seven out of ten patients saw a reduction in gynecomastia size with tamoxifen (P < 0.005), and the overall reduction for the group was statistically significant (P < 0.01). No benefits were observed with the placebo (P > 0.1). Additionally, all four patients with painful gynecomastia experienced relief of their symptoms, and no toxicity was noted. Although the breast size reduction was partial, this suggests that longer treatment may be necessary. Follow-up examinations conducted 9 to 12 months after treatment revealed no significant changes, except in two cases: one tamoxifen responder had a recurrence of breast tenderness after six months, and one non-responder developed increased breast size and new tenderness after ten months. Other medications are taken for similar purposes such as clomifene and aromatase inhibitor drugs; which are used in order to try to avoid the hormone-related adverse effects. Overall, tamoxifen appears to be a safe and effective treatment option for selected cases of gynecomastia. === Early puberty === Tamoxifen is useful in the treatment of peripheral precocious puberty, for instance due to McCune–Albright syndrome, in both girls and boys. It has been found to decrease growth velocity and the rate of bone maturation in girls with precocious puberty, and hence to improve final height in these individuals. === Available forms === Tamoxifen is available as a tablet or oral solution. == Contraindications == Tamoxifen has a number of contraindications, including known hypersensitivity to tamoxifen or other ingredients, individuals taking concomitant coumarin-type anticoagulant therapy, and women with a history of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism). == Side effects == A report in September 2009 from Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality suggests that tamoxifen, raloxifene, and tibolone used to treat breast cancer significantly reduce invasive breast cancer in midlife and older women, but also increase the risk of adverse side effects. === Endometrial cancer === Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Even though it is an antagonist in breast tissue it acts as partial agonist on the endometrium and has been linked to endometrial cancer in some women. Therefore, endometrial changes, including cancer, are among tamoxifen's side effects. With time, risk of endometrial cancer may be doubled to quadrupled, which is a reason tamoxifen is typically only used for five years. The American Cancer Society lists tamoxifen as a known carcinogen, stating that it increases the risk of some types of uterine cancer while lowering the risk of breast cancer recurrence. === Cardiovascular and metabolic === Tamoxifen treatment of postmenopausal women is associated with beneficial effects on serum lipid profiles. However, long-term data from clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a cardioprotective effect. For some women, tamoxifen can cause a rapid increase in triglyceride concentration in the blood. In addition, there is an increased risk of thromboembolism especially during and immediately after major surgery or periods of immobility. Use of tamoxifen has been shown to slightly increase risk of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke. === Liver toxicity === Tamoxifen has been associated with a number of cases of hepatotoxicity. Several different varieties of hepatotoxicity have been reported. Tamoxifen can also precipitate non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in obese and overweight women (not in normal weight women) at an average rate of 40% after a year use with 20 mg/day. == Overdose == Acute overdose of tamoxifen has not been reported in humans. In dose-ranging studies, tamoxifen was administered at very high doses in women (e.g., 300 mg/m2) and was found to produce acute neurotoxicity including tremor, hyperreflexia, unsteady gait, and dizziness. These symptoms occurred within three to five days of therapy and disappeared within two to five days of discontinuation of therapy. No indications of permanent neurotoxicity were observed. QT prolongation was also observed with very high doses of tamoxifen. There is no specific antidote for overdose of tamoxifen. Instead, treatment should be based on symptoms. == Interactions == Patients with variant forms of the gene CYP2D6 may not receive full benefit from tamoxifen because of too slow metabolism of the tamoxifen prodrug into its active metabolites. On 18 October 2006, the Subcommittee for Clinical Pharmacology recommended relabeling tamoxifen to include information about this gene in the package insert. Certain CYP2D6 variations in breast cancer patients lead to a worse clinical outcome for tamoxifen treatment. Genotyping therefore has the potential for identification of women who have these CYP2D6 phenotypes and for whom the use of tamoxifen is associated with poor outcomes. Recent research has shown that 7–10% of women with breast cancer may not receive the full medical benefit from taking tamoxifen due to their genetic make-up. DNA Drug Safety Testing can examine DNA variations in the CYP2D6 and other important drug processing pathways. More than 20% of all clinically used medications are metabolized by CYP2D6 and knowing the CYP2D6 status of a person can help the doctor with the future selection of medications. Other molecular biomarkers may also be used to select appropriate patients likely to benefit from tamoxifen. Recent studies suggest that taking the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) antidepressants paroxetine (Paxil), fluoxetine (Prozac), and sertraline (Zoloft) can decrease the effectiveness of tamoxifen, as these drugs compete for the CYP2D6 enzyme which is needed to metabolize tamoxifen into its active forms. A U.S. study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting in 2009 found that after two years, 7.5% of women who took only tamoxifen had a recurrence, compared with 16% who took either paroxetine, fluoxetine or sertraline, drugs considered to be the most potent CYP2D6 inhibitors. That difference translates to a 120% increase in the risk of breast cancer recurrence. Patients taking the SSRIs Celexa (citalopram), Lexapro (escitalopram), and Luvox (fluvoxamine) did not have an increased risk of recurrence, due to their lack of competitive metabolism for the CYP2D6 enzyme. A newer study demonstrated a clearer and stronger effect from paroxetine in causing the worst outcomes. Patients treated with both paroxetine and tamoxifen have a 67% increased risk of death from breast cancer, from 24% to 91%, depending on the duration of coadministration. Tamoxifen interacts with certain other antiestrogens. The aromatase inhibitor aminoglutethimide induces the metabolism of tamoxifen. Conversely, the aromatase inhibitor letrozole does not affect the metabolism of tamoxifen. However, tamoxifen induces the metabolism of letrozole and significantly reduces its concentrations. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Selective estrogen receptor modulator activity ==== Tamoxifen acts as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), or as a partial agonist of the estrogen receptors (ERs). It has mixed estrogenic and antiestrogenic activity, with its profile of effects differing by tissue. For instance, tamoxifen has predominantly antiestrogenic effects in the breasts but predominantly estrogenic effects in the uterus and liver. In breast tissue, tamoxifen acts as an ER antagonist so that transcription of estrogen-responsive genes is inhibited. A beneficial side effect of tamoxifen is that it prevents bone loss by acting as an ER agonist (i.e., mimicking the effects of estrogen) in this cell type. Therefore, by inhibiting osteoclasts, it prevents osteoporosis. When tamoxifen was launched as a drug, it was thought that tamoxifen would act as an ER antagonist in all tissues, including bone, and therefore it was feared that it would contribute to osteoporosis. It was therefore very surprising that the opposite effect was observed clinically. Hence tamoxifen's tissue selective action directly led to the formulation of the concept of SERMs. Tamoxifen is a long-acting SERM, with a nuclear retention of the ER–tamoxifen (or metabolite) complex of greater than 48 hours. It has relatively little affinity for the ERs itself and instead acts as a prodrug of active metabolites such as endoxifen (4-hydroxy-N-desmethyltamoxifen) and afimoxifene (4-hydroxytamoxifen; 4-OHT). These metabolites have approximately 30 to 100 times greater affinity for the ERs than tamoxifen itself. Per one study, tamoxifen had 7% and 6% of the affinity of estradiol for the ERα and ERβ, respectively, whereas afimoxifene had 178% and 338% of the affinity of estradiol for the ERα and ERβ, respectively. Hence, afimoxifene showed 25-fold higher affinity for the ERα and 56-fold higher affinity for the ERβ than tamoxifen. The antiestrogenic potencies of endoxifen and afimoxifene are very similar. However, endoxifen occurs in much higher concentrations than afimoxifene and is now thought to be the major active form of tamoxifen in the body. Tamoxifen binds to ER competitively (with respect to the endogenous agonist estrogen) in tumor cells and other tissue targets, producing a nuclear complex that decreases DNA synthesis and inhibits estrogen effects. It is a nonsteroidal agent with potent antiestrogenic properties which compete with estrogen for binding sites in breast and other tissues. Tamoxifen causes cells to remain in the G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle. Because it prevents (pre)cancerous cells from dividing but does not cause cell death, tamoxifen is cytostatic rather than cytocidal. Tamoxifen binds to ER, the ER/tamoxifen complex recruits other proteins known as co-repressors, and the complex then binds to DNA to modulate gene expression. Some of these proteins include NCoR and SMRT. Tamoxifen function can be regulated by a number of different variables including growth factors. Tamoxifen needs to block growth factor proteins such as ErbB2/HER2 because high levels of ErbB2 have been shown to occur in tamoxifen resistant cancers. Tamoxifen seems to require a protein PAX2 for its full anticancer effect. In the presence of high PAX2 expression, the tamoxifen/ER complex is able to suppress the expression of the pro-proliferative ERBB2 protein. In contrast, when AIB-1 expression is higher than PAX2, tamoxifen/ER complex upregulates the expression of ERBB2 resulting in stimulation of breast cancer growth. Tamoxifen is antigonadotropic in postmenopausal women and partially suppresses levels of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in such women. However, it has progonadotropic effects in premenopausal women and increases estrogen levels by 6-fold in them. Due to the nature of tamoxifen as a competitive ER ligand, this increase in estrogen levels is liable to interfere with the antiestrogenic efficacy of tamoxifen. The effects of tamoxifen on breast cancer Ki-67 expression, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, and IGF-1 levels are dose-dependent across a dosage range of 1 to 20 mg/day in women with breast cancer. Tamoxifen has been found to decrease insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels by 17 to 38% in women and men. Suppression of IGF-1 production in the liver is a well-known action of estrogens and SERMs. A 10 mg/day dosage of tamoxifen is nearly as effective as a 20 mg/day dosage in suppressing IGF-1 levels. ==== Other activities ==== Afimoxifene is an agonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) with relatively low affinity. Its affinity for the receptor is in the range of 100 to 1,000 nM, relative to 3 to 6 nM for estradiol. In addition to its activity as a SERM, afimoxifene binds to both the estrogen-related receptor β and estrogen-related receptor γ and is an antagonist of the estrogen-related receptor γ (ERRγ). Norendoxifen (4-hydroxy-N,N-didesmethyltamoxifen), another active metabolite of tamoxifen, has been found to act as a potent competitive aromatase inhibitor (IC50 = 90 nM), and may also be involved in the antiestrogenic activity of tamoxifen. In addition to its activity as a SERM, tamoxifen is a potent and selective protein kinase C inhibitor, and is active in this regard at therapeutic concentrations. This action is thought to underlie the efficacy of tamoxifen in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Tamoxifen is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. In 2018, it was discovered that tamoxifen directly interacts with the dopamine transporter (DAT) and acts as an atypical dopamine reuptake inhibitor (DRI). It has weak potency (54% inhibition of dopamine uptake at 10 μM) and lacks any stimulant or depressant effects when administered by itself. However, tamoxifen dose-dependently blocks amphetamine-mediated dopamine release and psychostimulant-like effects in animals. This unusual profile of DRI activity has made tamoxifen of potential interest as a starting point for structural modification to develop novel pharmaceutical drugs for treatment of stimulant use disorder. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Tamoxifen is rapidly and extensively absorbed from the intestines with oral administration. The oral bioavailability of tamoxifen is approximately 100%, which is suggestive of minimal first-pass metabolism in the intestines and liver. Following intake, peak levels of tamoxifen occur after three to seven hours. Steady state levels of tamoxifen are reached typically after 3 to 4 weeks but possibly up to 16 weeks of daily administration. Steady state levels of afimoxifene are achieved after 8 weeks of daily tamoxifen administration. Peak levels of tamoxifen after a single 40 mg oral dose were 65 ng/mL and steady state levels at 20 mg/day were 310 ng/mL. Levels of tamoxifen show clear dose dependency across a dosage range of 1 to 20 mg/day. Endoxifen levels are approximately 5 to 10 times higher than afimoxifene levels, with large interindividual variability. Endoxifen levels have been reported as 10.8 to 15.9 ng/mL at steady state in CYP2D6 normal metabolizers during therapy with 20 mg/day tamoxifen. The most abundant metabolites of tamoxifen in terms of circulating concentrations are N-desmethyltamoxifen, N,N-didesmethyltamoxifen, (Z)-endoxifen, and tamoxifen N-oxide. ==== Distribution ==== The volume of distribution of tamoxifen is 50 to 60 L/kg and its clearance has been estimated as 1.2 to 5.1 L/hour. High concentrations of tamoxifen have been found in breast, uterus, liver, kidney, lung, pancreas, and ovary tissue in animals and humans. Levels of tamoxifen in the uterus have been found to be 2- to 3-fold higher than in the circulation and in the breasts 10-fold higher than in the circulation. The plasma protein binding of tamoxifen and afimoxifene is greater than 99%. A majority of tamoxifen is bound to albumin. Albumin alone binds 98.8% of tamoxifen while other plasma proteins are not greatly involved. ==== Metabolism ==== Tamoxifen is a prodrug and is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 into active metabolites such as endoxifen (4-hydroxy-N-desmethyltamoxifen) and afimoxifene (4-hydroxytamoxifen). Conversion of tamoxifen by N-demethylation into N-desmethyltamoxifen, which is catalyzed primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, is responsible for approximately 92% of tamoxifen metabolism. Conversely, 4-hydroxylation of tamoxifen into afimoxifene is responsible for only about 7% of tamoxifen metabolism. Following its formation, N-desmethyltamoxifen is oxidized into several other metabolites, the most notable of which is endoxifen. Another active metabolite, norendoxifen (4-hydroxy-N,N-didesmethyltamoxifen), is formed via N-demethylation of endoxifen or 4-hydroxylation of N,N-didesmethyltamoxifen. Tamoxifen and its metabolites undergo conjugation, including glucuronidation and sulfation. Tamoxifen may inhibit its own metabolism. ==== Elimination ==== Tamoxifen has a long elimination half-life of typically 5 to 7 days, with a range of 4 to 11 days. Similarly, the half-life of afimoxifene is 14 days. Conversely, the half-life of endoxifen is 50 to 70 hours (2–3 days). The long half-lives of tamoxifen and afimoxifene are attributed to their high plasma protein binding as well as to enterohepatic recirculation. Upon discontinuation of treatment, levels of tamoxifen and its metabolites persist in the circulation for at least 6 weeks. Tamoxifen is excreted in bile and is eliminated in feces, while small amounts are eliminated in urine. == Chemistry == Tamoxifen is a nonsteroidal SERM of the triphenylethylene family and was structurally derived from diethylstilbestrol-like estrogens and antiestrogens such as chlorotrianisene and ethamoxytriphetol. Initially, clomifene was synthesized, and tamoxifen was developed subsequently. Tamoxifen is closely related structurally to other triphenylethylenes, such as clomifene, nafoxidine, ospemifene, toremifene, and numerous others. Other SERMs, like raloxifene, are structurally distinct from tamoxifen and other triphenylethylenes. == History == In the late 1950s, pharmaceutical companies were actively researching a newly discovered class of anti-estrogen compounds in the hope of developing a morning-after contraceptive pill. Arthur L Walpole was a reproductive endocrinologist who led such a team at the Alderley Park research laboratories of ICI Pharmaceuticals. It was there in 1962 that chemist Dora Richardson first synthesized tamoxifen, back then known as ICI-46,474, when she was looking to create triphenylethylene derivatives for the contraceptive pill project that her team was researching. This compound was originally created to work as an estrogen inhibitor, but instead was found to stimulate ovulation in participants of the drug testing trial. Walpole and his colleagues filed a UK patent covering this compound in 1962, but patent protection on this compound was repeatedly denied in the US until the 1980s. Tamoxifen did eventually receive marketing approval as a fertility treatment, but the class of compounds never proved useful in human contraception. A link between estrogen and breast cancer had been known for many years, but cancer treatments were not a corporate priority at the time, and Walpole's personal interests were important in keeping support for the compound alive in the face of this and the lack of patent protection. It was only when Walpole threatened to leave his position that corporate decided to allow trials and testing for tamoxifen as a drug that could be used to treat breast cancer. Without Walpole's effort towards defending the work that his team had done in discovering a possibly revolutionary source for breast cancer treatment, tamoxifen could have become a discarded or under-researched idea. Walpole's team consisted of Dora Richardson and G. A. Snow, who worked on the chemistry portion of the project, along with G. E. Paget and J. K. Walley, who focused primarily on the biological side. Tamoxifen is one of three drugs in an anti-angiogenetic protocol developed by Dr. Judah Folkman, a researcher at Children's Hospital at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Folkman discovered in the 1970s that angiogenesis – the growth of new blood vessels – plays a significant role in the development of cancer. Since his discovery, an entirely new field of cancer research has developed. Clinical trials on angiogenesis inhibitors have been underway since 1992 using many different drugs. The Harvard researchers developed a specific protocol for a golden retriever named Navy who was cancer-free after receiving the prescribed cocktail of celecoxib, doxycycline, and tamoxifen – the treatment subsequently became known as the Navy Protocol. Furthermore, tamoxifen treatment alone has been shown to have anti-angiogenetic effects in animal models of cancer which appear to be, at least in part, independent of tamoxifen's ER antagonist properties. Other antiestrogens, such as ethamoxytriphetol (MER-25) and clomifene (MRL-41), were assessed for treatment of breast cancer and found to be effective before tamoxifen, but were plagued with toxicity issues. The first clinical study of tamoxifen took place at the Christie Hospital in 1971, and showed a convincing effect in advanced breast cancer, but nevertheless ICI's development programme came close to termination when it was reviewed in 1972. In an unpublished article from the early days of the trial, Dora Richardson documented her team's excitement about tamoxifen's effects in counteracting infertility problems and the early positive effects found in breast cancer patients. Unfortunately, this work was not well received by everyone, as the team was supposed to be looking for a contraceptive pill. Tamoxifen's further development may have been bolstered by a second clinical study by Harold W.C. Ward at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. Ward's study showed a more definitive response to the drug at a higher dosage. Walpole also may have helped to convince the company to market tamoxifen for late stage breast cancer in 1973. He was also instrumental in funding V. Craig Jordan to work on tamoxifen. In 1972, ICI Pharmaceuticals Division abandoned development of tamoxifen for financial reasons. The drug was subsequently reinvented from a failed contraceptive, to become tamoxifen, the gold standard for the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer and the pioneering medicine for chemprevention for high-risk women. Two books, Estrogen Action, Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators and Women's Health (Imperial College Press 2013) and Tamoxifen: Pioneering Medicine in Breast Cancer (Springer 2013) tell this story. 1980 saw the publication of the first trial to show that tamoxifen given in addition to chemotherapy improved survival for patients with early breast cancer. In advanced disease, tamoxifen is now only recognized as effective in ER+ patients, but the early trials did not select ER+ patients, and by the mid-1980s the clinical trial picture was not showing a major advantage for tamoxifen. Nevertheless, tamoxifen had a relatively mild side-effect profile, and a number of large trials continued. The pharmacology of SERMs was discovered, defined, and deciphered during the 1980s. A clinical strategy was described that led to the creation of SERMs as a group of multifunctional medicines aimed at the treatment or prevention of many conditions in postmenopausal women, e.g. osteoporosis and breast cancer. The early sales of tamoxifen in both the UK and in the U.S. far exceeded ICI's original estimate, but despite this, at the annual portfolio review ICI's board members still asserted that \"there was no market for cancer\", leaving the drug's marketing success to rely on its clinical results and clinicians' and scientists' interests in it. Shortly after, Dora Richardson published a history of tamoxifen that, unusually for that type of paper, included personal accounts and letters from patients who attributed their healing to the drug. This testimony from cancer patients using tamoxifen helped to shape and push forward research, by justifying it both morally and scientifically to corporations. It was not until 1998 that the meta-analysis of the Oxford-based Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group showed definitively that tamoxifen was effective for early breast cancer. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Tamoxifen is marketed under the brand names Nolvadex and Soltamox, and a variety of other brand names throughout the world. === Economics === Global sales of tamoxifen in 2001 were approximately $1.02 billion. Since the expiration of the patent in 2002, it is widely available as a generic drug around the world. As of 2004, tamoxifen was the world's largest selling hormonal drug for the treatment of breast cancer. == Research == In McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) tamoxifen has been used to treat premature puberty and the consequences of premature puberty. Tamoxifen has been seen to decrease rapid bone maturation which is the result of excessive estrogen and alter predicted adult height (PAH). The same effects have also been seen in short pubertal boys. However, one in vitro study in 2007 and later an in vivo study in 2008 have shown that tamoxifen induces apoptosis in growth plate chondrocytes, reduces serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels and causes persistent retardation of longitudinal and cortical radial bone growth in young male rats, leading the researchers to express concern giving tamoxifen to growing individuals. Tamoxifen has been studied in the treatment of the rare conditions of retroperitoneal fibrosis and idiopathic sclerosing mesenteritis. It has also been proposed as part of a treatment plan for Riedel's thyroiditis. Tamoxifen is used as a research tool to trigger tissue-specific gene expression in many conditional expression constructs in genetically modified animals including a version of the Cre-Lox recombination technique. While widely used in transgenic research, the strong anabolic effect of tamoxifen on bone might confound this approach, especially as it relates to bone-targeted constructs. Tamoxifen may be effective in the treatment of mania in people with bipolar disorder. This is thought to be due to blockade of protein kinase C (PKC), an enzyme that regulates neuron activity in the brain. Researchers believe PKC is overactive during the mania in bipolar patients. As of September 2019, endoxifen, a major active metabolite of tamoxifen with a 4-fold more potent PKC inhibition, was in phase III clinical trials for bipolar disorder. == References == == Further reading == Dean L (2014). \"Tamoxifen Therapy and CYP2D6 Genotype\".

         " Niemann-Pick disease type C is a rare lysosomal storage disorder. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of  In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, we randomly assigned patients 4 years of age or older with genetically confirmed Niemann-Pick disease type C in a 1:1 ratio to receive NALL for 12 weeks, followed by placebo for 12 weeks, or to receive placebo for 12 weeks, followed by NALL for 12 weeks. NALL or matching placebo was administered orally two to three times per day, with patients 4 to 12 years of age receiving weight-based doses (2 to 4 g per day) and those 13 years of age or older receiving a dose of 4 g per day. The primary end point was the total score on the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA; range, 0 to 40, with lower scores indicating better neurologic status). Secondary end points included scores on the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement, the Spinocerebellar Ataxia Functional Index, and the Modified Disability Rating Scale. Crossover data from the two 12-week periods in each group were included in the comparisons of NALL with placebo. A total of 60 patients 5 to 67 years of age were enrolled. The mean baseline SARA total scores used in the primary analysis were 15.88 before receipt of the first dose of NALL (60 patients) and 15.68 before receipt of the first dose of placebo (59 patients; 1 patient never received placebo). The mean (±SD) change from baseline in the SARA total score was -1.97±2.43 points after 12 weeks of receiving NALL and -0.60±2.39 points after 12 weeks of receiving placebo (least-squares mean difference, -1.28 points; 95% confidence interval, -1.91 to -0.65; P<0.001). The results for the secondary end points were generally supportive of the findings in the primary analysis, but these were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. The incidence of adverse events was similar with NALL and placebo, and no treatment-related serious adverse events occurred. Among patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C, treatment with NALL for 12 weeks led to better neurologic status than placebo. A longer period is needed to determine the long-term effects of this agent in patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C. (Funded by IntraBio; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT05163288; EudraCT number, 2021-005356-10.). To investigate the safety and efficacy of N-acetyl-L-leucine (NALL) on symptoms, functioning, and quality of life in pediatric (≥ 6 years) and adult Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) patients. In this multi-national, open-label, rater-blinded Phase II study, patients were assessed during a baseline period, a 6-week treatment period (orally administered NALL 4 g/day in patients ≥ 13 years, weight-tiered doses for patients 6-12 years), and a 6-week post-treatment washout period. The primary Clinical Impression of Change in Severity (CI-CS) endpoint (based on a 7-point Likert scale) was assessed by blinded, centralized raters who compared randomized video pairs of each patient performing a pre-defined primary anchor test (8-Meter Walk Test or 9-Hole Peg Test) during each study periods. Secondary outcomes included cerebellar functional rating scales, clinical global impression, and quality of life assessments. 33 subjects aged 7-64 years with a confirmed diagnosis of NPC were enrolled. 32 patients were included in the primary modified intention-to-treat analysis. NALL met the CI-CS primary endpoint (mean difference 0.86, SD = 2.52, 90% CI 0.25, 1.75, p = 0.029), as well as secondary endpoints. No treatment-related serious adverse events occurred. NALL demonstrated a statistically significant and clinical meaningfully improvement in symptoms, functioning, and quality of life in 6 weeks, the clinical effect of which was lost after the 6-week washout period. NALL was safe and well-tolerated, informing a favorable benefit-risk profile for the treatment of NPC. CLINICALTRIALS. NCT03759639.",

         "Miltefosine, sold under the trade name Impavido among others, is a medication mainly used to treat leishmaniasis and free-living amoeba infections such as Naegleria fowleri and Balamuthia mandrillaris. This includes the three forms of leishmaniasis: cutaneous, visceral and mucosal. It may be used with liposomal amphotericin B or paromomycin. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, headaches, and decreased kidney function. More severe side effects may include Stevens–Johnson syndrome or low blood platelets. Use during pregnancy appears to cause harm to the baby and use during breastfeeding is not recommended. How it works is not entirely clear. Miltefosine was first made in the early 1980s and studied as a treatment for cancer. A few years later it was found to be useful for leishmaniasis and was approved for this use in 2002 in India. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. == Medical uses == === Leishmaniasis === Miltefosine is primarily used for the treatment of visceral and New World cutaneous leishmaniasis, and is undergoing clinical trials for this use in several countries. This drug is now listed as a core medication for the treatment of leishmaniasis under the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines. Several medical agents have some efficacy against visceral or cutaneous leishmaniasis, however, a 2005 survey concluded that miltefosine is the only effective oral treatment for both forms of leishmaniasis. === Amoeba infections === Miltefosine has been used successfully in some cases of the very rare, but highly lethal, brain infection by the amoeba, Naegleria fowleri, acquired through water entering the nose during a plunge in contaminated water. It has orphan drug status in the United States for acanthamoeba keratitis and primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === Miltefosine is listed as pregnancy category D by the FDA. This means there is evidence-based adverse reaction data from investigational or marketing experience or studies in humans of harm to the human fetus. Despite this evidence, the potential benefits of miltefosine may warrant use of the drug in pregnant women despite potential risks. A pregnancy test should be done prior to starting treatment. Effective birth control should be used while on miltefosine and 5 months after discontinuation of treatment. Its use during breast feeding is most likely unsafe. == Contraindications == Miltefosine is contraindicated in individuals who have a hypersensitivity to this medication, pregnant women, and people who have the Sjögren-Larsson syndrome. It is embryotoxic and fetotoxic in rats and rabbits, and teratogenic in rats but not in rabbits. It is therefore contraindicated for use during pregnancy, and contraception is required beyond the end of treatment in women of child-bearing age. == Side effects == Common side effects from miltefosine treatment are nausea and vomiting, which occur in 60% of people. Other common side effects are dizziness, headache, and daytime sleepiness. Serious side effects include rash, diarrhea, and arthritis. The side effects are more severe in women and young children. The overall effects are quite mild and easily reversed. == Mechanism of action == Miltefosine primarily acts on Leishmania by affecting the species's promastigote and amastigote stages. Miltefosine exerts its activity by interacting with lipids, inhibiting cytochrome c oxidase and causing apoptosis-like cell death. This may affect membrane integrity and mitochondrial function of the parasite. == History == === Cancer === While initially studied as a cancer medication, due to side effects it was never used for this purpose. Phospholipid group alkylphosphocholine were known since the early 1980s, particularly in terms of their binding affinity with cobra venom. In 1987 the phospholipids were found to be potent toxins on leukemic cell culture. Initial in vivo investigation on the antineoplastic activity showed positive result, but then only at high dosage and at high toxicity. At the same time in Germany, Hansjörg Eibl, at the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, and Clemens Unger, at the University of Göttingen, demonstrated that the antineoplastic activity of the phospholipid analogue miltefosine (at the time known as hexadecylphosphocholine) was indeed tumour-specific. It was highly effective against methylnitrosourea-induced mammary carcinoma, but less so on transplantable mammary carcinomas and autochthonous benzo(a)pyrene-induced sarcomas, and relatively inactive on Walker 256 carcinosarcoma and autochthonous acetoxymethylmethylnitrosamine-induced colonic tumors of rats. It was subsequently found that miltefosine was structurally unique among lipids having anticancer property in that it lacks the glycerol group, is highly selective on cell types and acts through different mechanism. === Leishmaniasis === In the same year as the discovery of the anticancer property, miltefosine was reported by S. L. Croft and his team at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine as having antileishmanial effect as well. The compound was effective against Leishmania donovani amastigotes in cultured mouse peritoneal macrophages at a dose of 12.8 mg/kg/day in a five-day course. However, priority was given to the development of the compound for cutaneous metastases of breast cancer. In 1992 a new research was reported in which the compound was highly effective in mouse against different life cycle stages of different Leishmania species, and in fact, more potent than the conventional sodium stibogluconate therapy by a factor of more than 600. Results of the first clinical trial in humans were reported from Indian patients with chronic leishmaniasis with high degree of success and safety. This promising development promulgated a unique public–private partnership collaboration between ASTA Medica (later Zentaris GmbH), the World Health Organization (WHO) Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases, and the Government of India. Eventually, several successful Phase II and III trials led to the approval of miltefosine in 2002 as the first and only oral drug for leishmaniasis. === Naegleria fowleri and Acanthamoeba === In 2013, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended miltefosine for the treatment of free-living amoeba infections such as granulomatous amoebic encephalitis and primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, two fatal protozoal diseases. Historically, only four survivors have been recorded out of 138 confirmed infections in North America. One American survived the infection in 1978 and one individual from Mexico in 2003. In 2013, two children survived and recovered from primary amoebic meningoencephalitis after treatment with miltefosine. In 2016 after treatment that included miltefosine, another child became the fourth person in the United States to survive Naegleria fowleri infection. == Society and culture == === Availability === Since 2017 Miltefosine is commercially available in the United States through Profounda. Previously one could only get it from the CDC for emergency use under an expanded access IND protocol for treatment of free-living amoeba (FLA) infections: primary amoebic meningoencephalitis caused by Naegleria fowleri and granulomatous amoebic encephalitis caused by Balamuthia mandrillaris and Acanthamoeba species. Miltefosine is almost exclusively produced by Profounda, a private pharmaceutical company. === Economics === In the developing world a course of treatment costs US$65 to $150. In the developed world treatment may be 10 to 50 times greater. == Further research == It is active against some bacteria and fungi, as well as human trematode Schistosoma mansoni and the snail that spreads it Biomphalaria alexandrina. === Antiprotozoal and antifungal activities === Miltefosine is being investigated by researchers interested in finding treatments for infections which have become resistant to existing drugs. Animal and in vitro studies suggest it may have broad anti-protozoal and anti-fungal properties: Animal studies suggest miltefosine may also be effective against Trypanosoma cruzi, the parasite responsible for Chagas' disease. Several studies have found the drug to be effective against types of fungus: Cryptococcus neoformans, Candida, Aspergillus and Fusarium. A 2006 in vitro study found that miltefosine is effective against metronidazole-resistant variants of Trichomonas vaginalis, a sexually transmitted protozoal disease. Cetrimonium bromide, a compound related to miltefosine, was demonstrated in 2007 to exhibit potent in vitro activity against Plasmodium falciparum. An in vitro test in 2006 showed that miltefosine is effective against the deadly protozoan pathogens, Naegleria fowleri, Balamuthia mandrillaris, and Acanthamoeba. However, later in vitro and animal model experiments showed that it is not as potent as other drugs, such as chlorpromazine and diminazene aceturate (Berenil). In 2013, there were reports of failure of miltefosine in the treatment of leishmaniasis. Although drug resistance was suspected, studies in 2014 reported that miltefosine is not so effective in children, most probably related to a lack of drug exposure in children. Moverover, males appeared to have a higher probability of relapse as well. A 2012 in vitro study found that miltefosine had promising activity against Candida albicans biofilms. === Anti-HIV activity === Miltefosine targets HIV infected macrophages, which play a role in vivo as long-lived HIV-1 reservoirs. The HIV protein Tat activates pro-survival PI3K/Akt pathway in primary human macrophages. Miltefosine acts by inhibiting the PI3K/Akt pathway, thus removing the infected macrophages from circulation, without affecting healthy cells. It significantly reduces replication of HIV-1 in cocultures of human dendritic cells (DCs) and CD4+ T cells, which is due to a rapid secretion of soluble factors and is associated with induction of type-I interferon (IFN) in the human cells. == References == == External links == \"Miltefosine\".

         " Lately, nucleos(t)ide antivirals topped the scene as top options for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Targeting the two broadly conserved SARS-CoV-2 enzymes, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease (ExoN), together using only one shot is a very successful new tactic to stop SARS-CoV-2 multiplication irrespective of the SARS-CoV-2 variant type. Herein, the current studies investigated most nucleoside analogue (NA) libraries, searching for the ideal drug candidates expectedly able to act through this double tactic. Gradual computational filtration gave rise to six different promising NAs along with their corresponding triphosphate (TP) nucleotides. The subsequent biological assessment proved for the first time that, among the six NAs, riboprine and forodesine are able to hyperpotently inhibit the replication of the Omicron strain of SARS-CoV-2 with extremely low ",

         " N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) is a compound of increasing interest in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Primarily through its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and glutamate modulation activity, NAC has been investigated in the treatment of neurodevelopmental disorders, schizophrenia spectrum disorders, bipolar-related disorders, depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive compulsive-related disorders, substance-use disorders, neurocognitive disorders, and chronic pain. Whilst there is ample preclinical evidence and theoretical justification for the use of NAC in the treatment of multiple psychiatric disorders, clinical trials in most disorders have yielded mixed results. However, most studies have been underpowered and perhaps too brief, with some evidence of benefit only after months of treatment with NAC. Currently NAC has the most evidence of having a beneficial effect as an adjuvant agent in the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, severe autism, depression, and obsessive compulsive and related disorders. Future research with well-powered studies that are of sufficient length will be critical to better understand the utility of NAC in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. NAC (N-acetyl-L-cysteine) is commonly used to identify and test ROS (reactive oxygen species) inducers, and to inhibit ROS. In the present study, we identified inhibition of proteasome inhibitors as a novel activity of NAC. Both NAC and catalase, another known scavenger of ROS, similarly inhibited ROS levels and apoptosis associated with H₂O₂. However, only NAC, and not catalase or another ROS scavenger Trolox, was able to prevent effects linked to proteasome inhibition, such as protein stabilization, apoptosis and accumulation of ubiquitin conjugates. These observations suggest that NAC has a dual activity as an inhibitor of ROS and proteasome inhibitors. Recently, NAC was used as a ROS inhibitor to functionally characterize a novel anticancer compound, piperlongumine, leading to its description as a ROS inducer. In contrast, our own experiments showed that this compound depicts features of proteasome inhibitors including suppression of FOXM1 (Forkhead box protein M1), stabilization of cellular proteins, induction of ROS-independent apoptosis and enhanced accumulation of ubiquitin conjugates. In addition, NAC, but not catalase or Trolox, interfered with the activity of piperlongumine, further supporting that piperlongumine is a proteasome inhibitor. Most importantly, we showed that NAC, but not other ROS scavengers, directly binds to proteasome inhibitors. To our knowledge, NAC is the first known compound that directly interacts with and antagonizes the activity of proteasome inhibitors. Taken together, the findings of the present study suggest that, as a result of the dual nature of NAC, data interpretation might not be straightforward when NAC is utilized as an antioxidant to demonstrate ROS involvement in drug-induced apoptosis. The most commonly used chemopreventive agents in the prevention of oral leukoplakia, head and neck cancer, and lung cancer are beta-carotene, vitamin A, and other retinoids. One of the few chemopreventive agents not in this group and presently being used in a clinical trial is N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC). NAC, an antioxidant, is used in EUROSCAN, a European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) chemoprevention study in curatively treated patients with oral, laryngeal, or lung cancer. The rationale for choosing NAC is based on a variety of experimental data showing its ability to exert protective effects, including extracellular inhibition of mutagenic agents from exogenous and endogenous sources, inhibition of genotoxicity of reactive oxygen species, modulation of metabolism coordinated with blocking of reactive metabolites, protection of DNA and nuclear enzymes, and prevention of the formation of carcinogen-DNA adducts. NAC has also demonstrated an effect on mutagen-induced chromosomal sensitivity assays, and on anticarcinogenicity in experimental animal models. In addition, preliminary data from EUROSCAN show good compliance in treated patients and a low frequency of side effects.",

         "mouse",
         "Metformin, sold under the brand name Glucophage, among others, is the main first-line medication for the treatment of type 2 diabetes, particularly in people who are overweight. It is also used in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome, and is sometimes used as an off-label adjunct to lessen the risk of metabolic syndrome in people who take antipsychotic medication. It has been shown to inhibit inflammation, and is not associated with weight gain. Metformin is taken by mouth. Metformin is generally well tolerated. Common adverse effects include diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain. It has a small risk of causing low blood sugar. High blood lactic acid level (acidosis) is a concern if the medication is used in overly large doses or prescribed in people with severe kidney problems. Metformin is a biguanide anti-hyperglycemic agent. It works by decreasing glucose production in the liver, increasing the insulin sensitivity of body tissues, and increasing GDF15 secretion, which reduces appetite and caloric intake. Metformin was first described in the scientific literature in 1922 by Emil Werner and James Bell. French physician Jean Sterne began the study in humans in the 1950s. It was introduced as a medication in France in 1957. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the second most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 86 million prescriptions. In Australia, it was one of the top 10 most prescribed medications between 2017 and 2023. == Medical uses == Metformin is used to lower the blood glucose in those with type 2 diabetes. It is also used as a second-line agent for infertility in those with polycystic ovary syndrome. === Type 2 diabetes === The American Diabetes Association and the American College of Physicians both recommend metformin as a first-line agent to treat type 2 diabetes. It is as effective as repaglinide and more effective than all other oral drugs for type 2 diabetes. ==== Efficacy ==== Treatment guidelines for major professional associations, including the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, the European Society for Cardiology, and the American Diabetes Association, describe evidence for the cardiovascular benefits of metformin as equivocal. A 2020 Cochrane systematic review did not find enough evidence of reduction of cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke when comparing metformin monotherapy to other glucose-lowering drugs, behavior change interventions, placebo or no intervention. The use of metformin reduces body weight in people with type 2 diabetes in contrast to sulfonylureas, which are associated with weight gain. Some evidence shows that metformin is associated with weight loss in obesity in the absence of diabetes. Metformin has a lower risk of hypoglycemia than the sulfonylureas, although hypoglycemia has uncommonly occurred during intense exercise, calorie deficit, or when used with other agents to lower blood glucose. Metformin modestly reduces low density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels. In individuals with prediabetes, a 2019 systematic review comparing the effects of metformin with other interventions in the reduction of risk of developing type 2 diabetes found moderate-quality evidence that metformin reduced the risk of developing type 2 diabetes when compared to diet and exercise or a placebo. However, when comparing metformin to intensive diet or exercise, moderate-quality evidence was found that metformin did not reduce risk of developing type 2 diabetes and very low-quality evidence was found that adding metformin to intensive diet or exercise did not show any advantage or disadvantage in reducing risk of type 2 diabetes when compared to intensive exercise and diet alone. The same review also found one suitable trial comparing the effects of metformin and sulfonylurea in reducing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in prediabetic individuals, however, this trial did not report any patient-relevant outcomes. === Polycystic ovarian syndrome === In those with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), tentative evidence shows that metformin use increases the rate of live births. This includes in those who have not been able to get pregnant with clomiphene. Metformin does not appear to change the risk of miscarriage. A number of other benefits have also been found both during pregnancy and in nonpregnant women with PCOS. In an updated Cochrane (2020) review on metformin versus placebo/no treatment before or during IVF/ICSI in women with PCOS no conclusive evidence of improved live birth rates was found. In long GnRH-agonist protocols there was uncertainty in the evidence of improved live birth rates but there could be increases in clinical pregnancy rate. In short GnRH-antagonist protocols metformin may reduce live birth rates with uncertainty on its effect on clinical pregnancy rate. Metformin may result in a reduction of OHSS but could come with a greater frequency of side effects. There was uncertainty as to metformin's impact on miscarriage. The evidence does not support general use during pregnancy for improving maternal and infant outcomes in obese women. The United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended in 2004 that women with PCOS and a body mass index above 25 be given metformin for anovulation and infertility when other therapies fail to produce results. UK and international clinical practice guidelines do not recommend metformin as a first-line treatment or do not recommend it at all, except for women with glucose intolerance. The guidelines suggest clomiphene as the first medication option and emphasize lifestyle modification independently from medical treatment. Metformin treatment decreases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in women with PCOS who exhibited impaired glucose tolerance at baseline. === Diabetes and pregnancy === A total review of metformin use during pregnancy compared to insulin alone found good short-term safety for both the mother and baby, but safety in the longer term is unclear. Several observational studies and randomized controlled trials found metformin to be as effective and safe as insulin for the management of gestational diabetes. Nonetheless, several concerns have been raised and evidence on the long-term safety of metformin for both mother and child is lacking. Compared with insulin, women with gestational diabetes treated with metformin gain less weight and are less likely to develop pre‐eclampsia during pregnancy. Babies born to women treated with metformin have less visceral fat, and this may make them less prone to insulin resistance in later life. The use of metformin for gestational diabetes resulted in smaller babies compared to treatment with insulin. However, despite initially lower birth weight, children exposed to metformin during pregnancy had accelerated growth after birth, and were heavier by mid-childhood than those exposed to insulin during pregnancy. This pattern of initial low birth weight followed by catch-up growth that surpasses comparative children has been associated with long-term cardiometabolic disease. A systematic review and meta-analysis of metformin, published in 2024, found that it is safe and effective in managing gestational diabetes or diabetes in pregnancy with no adverse impact on the mother or the child after eleven years of childbirth. === Weight change === Metformin use is typically associated with weight loss. It appears to be safe and effective in counteracting the weight gain caused by the antipsychotic medications olanzapine and clozapine. Although modest reversal of clozapine-associated weight gain is found with metformin, primary prevention of weight gain is more valuable. === Use with insulin === Metformin may reduce the insulin requirement in type 1 diabetes, albeit with an increased risk of hypoglycemia. == Contraindications == Metformin is contraindicated in people with: Severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) Known hypersensitivity to metformin Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis (from uncontrolled diabetes), with or without coma == Adverse effects == The most common adverse effect of metformin is gastrointestinal irritation, including diarrhea, cramps, nausea, vomiting, and increased flatulence. Metformin is more commonly associated with gastrointestinal adverse effects than most other antidiabetic medications. The most serious potential adverse effect of metformin is lactic acidosis; this complication is rare, and seems to be related to impaired liver or kidney function. Metformin is not approved for use in those with severe kidney disease, but may still be used at lower doses in those with kidney problems. === Gastrointestinal === Gastrointestinal upset can cause severe discomfort; it is most common when metformin is first administered, or when the dose is increased. The discomfort can often be avoided by beginning at a low dose (1.0 to 1.7 g/day) and increasing the dose gradually, but even with low doses, 5% of people may be unable to tolerate metformin. Use of slow or extended-release preparations may improve tolerability. Long-term use of metformin has been associated with increased homocysteine levels and malabsorption of vitamin B12. Higher doses and prolonged use are associated with increased incidence of vitamin B12 deficiency, and some researchers recommend screening or prevention strategies. ==== Vitamin B12 ==== Metformin treatment has been associated with reductions in vitamin B12 in certain people. Left untreated, vitamin B12 deficiencies can lead to serious health problems including neurological problems and anemia. Although more research is needed to understand the mechanisms of this association, it is suggested that people who take metformin monitor their vitamin B12 levels and if low, begin supplementation. In most cases of deficiencies if the person's deficiency can be corrected with exogenous administration of vitamin B12, they can continue their metformin treatment under the supervision of their doctor. === Lactic acidosis === Lactic acidosis rarely occurs with metformin exposure during routine medical care. Rates of metformin-associated lactic acidosis are about nine per 100,000 persons/year, which is similar to the background rate of lactic acidosis in the general population. A systematic review concluded no data exists to definitively link metformin to lactic acidosis. Metformin is generally safe in people with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease, with a proportional reduction of metformin dose according to severity of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and with periodic assessment of kidney function, (e.g., periodic plasma creatinine measurement). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends avoiding the use of metformin in more severe chronic kidney disease, below the eGFR cutoff of 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2. Lactate uptake by the liver is diminished with metformin use because lactate is a substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis, a process that metformin inhibits. In healthy individuals, this slight excess is cleared by other mechanisms (including uptake by unimpaired kidneys), and no significant elevation in blood levels of lactate occurs. Given severely impaired kidney function, clearance of metformin and lactate is reduced, increasing levels of both, and possibly causing lactic acid buildup. Because metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate, any condition that may precipitate lactic acidosis is a contraindication. Common causes include alcoholism (due to depletion of NAD+ stores), heart failure, and respiratory disease (due to inadequate tissue oxygenation); the most common cause is kidney disease. Metformin-associated lactate production may also take place in the large intestine, which could potentially contribute to lactic acidosis in those with risk factors. The clinical significance of this is unknown, though, and the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is most commonly attributed to decreased hepatic uptake rather than increased intestinal production. === Overdose === The most common symptoms following an overdose include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, tachycardia, drowsiness, and rarely, hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Treatment of metformin overdose is generally supportive, as no specific antidote is known. Extracorporeal treatments are recommended in severe overdoses. Due to metformin's low molecular weight and lack of plasma protein binding, these techniques have the benefit of removing metformin from the blood plasma, preventing further lactate overproduction. Metformin may be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to monitor therapy, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or assist in a forensic death investigation. Blood or plasma metformin concentrations are usually in a range of 1–4 mg/L in persons receiving therapeutic doses, 40–120 mg/L in victims of acute overdosage, and 80–200 mg/L in fatalities. Chromatographic techniques are commonly employed. The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is also increased by a massive overdose of metformin, although even quite large doses are often not fatal. === Interactions === The H2-receptor antagonist cimetidine causes an increase in the plasma concentration of metformin by reducing clearance of metformin by the kidneys; both metformin and cimetidine are cleared from the body by tubular secretion, and both, particularly the cationic (positively charged) form of cimetidine, may compete for the same transport mechanism. A small double-blind, randomized study found the antibiotic cephalexin to also increase metformin concentrations by a similar mechanism; theoretically, other cationic medications may produce the same effect. Metformin also interacts with anticholinergic medications, due to their effect on gastric motility. Anticholinergic drugs reduce gastric motility, prolonging the time drugs spend in the gastrointestinal tract. This impairment may lead to more metformin being absorbed than without the presence of an anticholinergic drug, thereby increasing the concentration of metformin in the plasma and increasing the risk for adverse effects. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === The molecular mechanism of metformin is not completely understood. Multiple potential mechanisms of action have been proposed: inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (complex I), activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), inhibition of glucagon-induced elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) with reduced activation of protein kinase A (PKA), complex IV–mediated inhibition of the GPD2 variant of mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (thereby reducing the contribution of glycerol to hepatic gluconeogenesis), and an effect on gut microbiota. Metformin exerts an anorexiant effect in most people, decreasing caloric intake. Metformin decreases gluconeogenesis (glucose production) in the liver. Metformin inhibits basal secretion from the pituitary gland of growth hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, and expression of proopiomelanocortin, which in part accounts for its insulin-sensitizing effect with multiple actions on tissues including the liver, skeletal muscle, endothelium, adipose tissue, and the ovaries. The average patient with type 2 diabetes has three times the normal rate of gluconeogenesis; metformin treatment reduces this by over one-third. Activation of AMPK was required for metformin's inhibitory effect on liver glucose production. AMPK is an enzyme that plays an important role in insulin signaling, whole-body energy balance, and the metabolism of glucose and fats. AMPK activation is required for an increase in the expression of small heterodimer partner, which in turn inhibited the expression of the hepatic gluconeogenic genes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase. Metformin is frequently used in research along with AICA ribonucleotide as an AMPK agonist. The mechanism by which biguanides increase the activity of AMPK remains uncertain: metformin increases the concentration of cytosolic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (as opposed to a change in total AMP or total AMP/adenosine triphosphate) which could activate AMPK allosterically at high levels; a newer theory involves binding to PEN-2. Metformin inhibits cyclic AMP production, blocking the action of glucagon, and thereby reducing fasting glucose levels. Metformin also induces a profound shift in the faecal microbial community profile in diabetic mice, and this may contribute to its mode of action possibly through an effect on glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion. In addition to suppressing hepatic glucose production, metformin increases insulin sensitivity, enhances peripheral glucose uptake (by inducing the phosphorylation of GLUT4 enhancer factor), decreases insulin-induced suppression of fatty acid oxidation, and decreases the absorption of glucose from the gastrointestinal tract. Increased peripheral use of glucose may be due to improved insulin binding to insulin receptors. The increase in insulin binding after metformin treatment has also been demonstrated in patients with type 2 diabetes. AMPK probably also plays a role in increased peripheral insulin sensitivity, as metformin administration increases AMPK activity in skeletal muscle. AMPK is known to cause GLUT4 deployment to the plasma membrane, resulting in insulin-independent glucose uptake. Some metabolic actions of metformin do appear to occur by AMPK-independent mechanisms, however, AMPK likely has a modest overall effect and its activity is not likely to directly decrease gluconeogenesis in the liver. Metformin has indirect antiandrogenic effects in women with insulin resistance, such as those with PCOS, due to its beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity. It may reduce testosterone levels in such women by as much as 50%. A Cochrane review, though, found that metformin was only slightly effective for decreasing androgen levels in women with PCOS. Metformin also has significant effects on the gut microbiome, such as its effect on increasing agmatine production by gut bacteria, but the relative importance of this mechanism compared to other mechanisms is uncertain. Due to its effect on GLUT4 and AMPK, metformin has been described as an exercise mimetic. === Pharmacokinetics === Metformin has an oral bioavailability of 50–60% under fasting conditions, and is absorbed slowly. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) are reached within 1–3 hours of taking immediate-release metformin and 4–8 hours with extended-release formulations. The plasma protein binding of metformin is negligible, as reflected by its very high apparent volume of distribution (300–1000 L after a single dose). Steady state is usually reached in 1–2 days. Metformin has acid dissociation constant values (pKa) of 2.8 and 11.5, so it exists very largely as the hydrophilic cationic species at physiological pH values. The metformin pKa values make it a stronger base than most other basic medications with less than 0.01% nonionized in blood. Furthermore, the lipid solubility of the nonionized species is slight as shown by its low logP value (log(10) of the distribution coefficient of the nonionized form between octanol and water) of −1.43. These chemical parameters indicate low lipophilicity and, consequently, rapid passive diffusion of metformin through cell membranes is unlikely. As a result of its low lipid solubility, it requires the transporter SLC22A1 for it to enter cells. The logP of metformin is less than that of phenformin (−0.84) because two methyl substituents on metformin impart lesser lipophilicity than the larger phenylethyl side chain in phenformin. More lipophilic derivatives of metformin are presently under investigation to produce prodrugs with superior oral absorption than metformin. Metformin is not metabolized. It is cleared from the body by tubular secretion and excreted unchanged in the urine; it is undetectable in blood plasma within 24 hours of a single oral dose. The average elimination half-life in plasma is 6.2 hours. Metformin is distributed to (and appears to accumulate in) red blood cells, with a much longer elimination half-life: 17.6 hours (reported as ranging from 18.5 to 31.5 hours in a single-dose study of nondiabetics). Some evidence indicates that liver concentrations of metformin in humans may be two to three times higher than plasma concentrations, due to portal vein absorption and first-pass uptake by the liver in oral administration. == Chemistry == Metformin hydrochloride (1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride) is freely soluble in water, slightly soluble in ethanol, but almost insoluble in acetone, ether, or chloroform. The pKa of metformin is 12.4. The usual synthesis of metformin, originally described in 1922, involves the one-pot reaction of dimethylamine hydrochloride and 2-cyanoguanidine overheat. According to the procedure described in the 1975 Aron patent, and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Encyclopedia, equimolar amounts of dimethylamine and 2-cyanoguanidine are dissolved in toluene with cooling to make a concentrated solution, and an equimolar amount of hydrogen chloride is slowly added. The mixture begins to boil on its own, and after cooling, metformin hydrochloride precipitates with a 96% yield. === Impurities === In December 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that it learned that some metformin medicines manufactured outside the United States might contain a nitrosamine impurity called N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), classified as a probable human carcinogen, at low levels. Health Canada announced that it was assessing NDMA levels in metformin. In February 2020, the FDA found NDMA levels in some tested metformin samples that did not exceed the acceptable daily intake. In February 2020, Health Canada announced a recall of Apotex immediate-release metformin, followed in March by recalls of Ranbaxy metformin and in March by Jamp metformin. In May 2020, the FDA asked five companies to voluntarily recall their sustained-release metformin products. The five companies were not named, but they were revealed to be Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Actavis Pharma, Apotex Corp, Lupin Pharma, and Marksans Pharma Limited in a letter sent to Valisure, the pharmacy that had first alerted the FDA to this contaminant in metformin via a Citizen Petition. In June 2020, the FDA posted its laboratory results showing NDMA amounts in metformin products it tested. It found NDMA in certain lots of ER metformin and is recommending companies recall lots with levels of NDMA above the acceptable intake limit of 96 nanograms per day. The FDA is also collaborating with international regulators to share testing results for metformin. In July 2020, Lupin Pharmaceuticals pulled all lots (batches) of metformin after discovering unacceptably high levels of NDMA in tested samples. In August 2020, Bayshore Pharmaceuticals recalled two lots of tablets. The FDA issued revised guidelines about nitrosamine impurities in September 2024. == History == The biguanide class of antidiabetic medications, which also includes the withdrawn agents phenformin and buformin, originates from the plant Goat's rue (Galega officinalis) also known as Galega, French lilac, Italian fitch, Spanish sainfoin, Pestilenzkraut, or Professor-weed. (The plant should not be confused with plants in the genus Tephrosia which are highly toxic and sometimes also called Goat's rue.) Galega officinalis has been used in folk medicine for several centuries. G. officinalis itself does not contain biguanide medications which are chemically synthesized compounds composed of two guanidine molecules and designed to be less toxic than the plant-derived parent compounds guanidine and galegine (isoamylene guanidine). Metformin was first described in the scientific literature in 1922, by Emil Werner and James Bell, as a product in the synthesis of N,N-dimethylguanidine. In 1929, Slotta and Tschesche discovered its sugar-lowering action in rabbits, finding it the most potent biguanide analog they studied. This result was ignored, as other guanidine analogs such as the synthalins, took over and were themselves soon overshadowed by insulin. Interest in metformin resumed at the end of the 1940s. In 1950, metformin, unlike some other similar compounds, was found not to decrease blood pressure and heart rate in animals. That year, Filipino physician Eusebio Y. Garcia used metformin (he named it Fluamine) to treat influenza; he noted the medication \"lowered the blood sugar to minimum physiological limit\" and was not toxic. Garcia believed metformin to have bacteriostatic, antiviral, antimalarial, antipyretic, and analgesic actions. In a series of articles in 1954, Polish pharmacologist Janusz Supniewski was unable to confirm most of these effects, including lowered blood sugar. Instead, he observed antiviral effects in humans. French diabetologist Jean Sterne studied the antihyperglycemic properties of galegine, an alkaloid isolated from G. officinalis, which is related in structure to metformin, and had seen brief use as an antidiabetic before the synthalins were developed. Later, working at Laboratoires Aron in Paris, he was prompted by Garcia's report to reinvestigate the blood sugar-lowering activity of metformin and several biguanide analogs. Sterne was the first to try metformin on humans for the treatment of diabetes; he coined the name \"Glucophage\" (glucose eater) for the medication and published his results in 1957. Metformin became available in the British National Formulary in 1958. It was sold in the UK by a small Aron subsidiary called Rona. Broad interest in metformin was not rekindled until the withdrawal of the other biguanides in the 1970s. Metformin was approved in Canada in 1972, but did not receive approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for type 2 diabetes until 1994. Produced under license by Bristol-Myers Squibb, Glucophage was the first branded formulation of metformin to be marketed in the U.S., beginning on 3 March 1995. Generic formulations are available in several countries. The US FDA granted the application for metformin orphan drug designation. The European Medicines Agency granted orphan drug status to metformin. == Society and culture == === Environmental impact === Metformin and its major transformation product guanylurea are present in wastewater treatment plant effluents and regularly detected in surface waters. Guanylurea concentrations above 200 μg/L have been measured in the German river Erpe, which are amongst the highest reported for pharmaceutical transformation products in aquatic environments. === Formulations === Metformin is the British Approved Name (BAN), the United States Adopted Name (USAN), and the International Nonproprietary Name (INN). It is sold under several brand names. Common brand names include Glucophage, Riomet, Fortamet, and Glumetza in the US. In other areas of the world, there is also Obimet, Gluformin, Dianben, Diabex, Diaformin, Metsol, Siofor, Metfogamma and Glifor. There are several formulations of metformin available on the market, and all but the liquid form have generic equivalents. ==== Combination with other medications ==== When used for type 2 diabetes, metformin is often prescribed in combination with other medications. Several medications are available as fixed-dose combinations, with the potential to reduce pill burden, decrease cost, and simplify administration. ===== Thiazolidinediones (glitazones) ===== ====== Rosiglitazone ====== A combination of metformin and rosiglitazone was released in 2002, and sold as Avandamet by GlaxoSmithKline, or as a generic medication. Formulations are 500/1, 500/2, 500/4, 1000/2, and 1000 mg/4 mg of metformin/rosiglitazone. In 2009, it was the most popular metformin combination. In 2005, the stock of Avandamet was removed from the market, after inspections showed the factory where it was produced was violating good manufacturing practices. The medication pair continued to be prescribed separately, and Avandamet was again available by the end of that year. A generic formulation of metformin/rosiglitazone from Teva received tentative approval from the FDA and reached the market in early 2012. However, following a meta-analysis in 2007, that linked the medication's use to an increased risk of heart attack, concerns were raised over the safety of medicines containing rosiglitazone. In September 2010, the European Medicines Agency recommended that the medication be suspended from the European market because the benefits of rosiglitazone no longer outweighed the risks. It was withdrawn from the market in the UK and India in 2010, and in New Zealand and South Africa in 2011. From November 2011 until November 2013 the FDA did not allow rosiglitazone or metformin/rosiglitazone to be sold without a prescription; moreover, makers were required to notify patients of the risks associated with its use, and the drug had to be purchased by mail order through specified pharmacies. In November 2013, the FDA lifted its earlier restrictions on rosiglitazone after reviewing the results of the 2009 RECORD clinical trial (a six-year, open-label randomized control trial), which failed to show elevated risk of heart attack or death associated with the medication. ====== Pioglitazone ====== The combination of metformin and pioglitazone (Actoplus Met, Piomet, Politor, Glubrava) is available in the US and the European Union. ===== DPP-4 inhibitors ===== Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and thus reduce glucagon and blood glucose levels. DPP-4 inhibitors combined with metformin include a sitagliptin/metformin combination (Janumet), a saxagliptin/metformin combination (Kombiglyze XR, Komboglyze), and an alogliptin/metformin combination (Kazano, Vipdomet). Linagliptin combined with metformin hydrochloride is sold under the brand name Jentadueto. As of August 2021, linagliptin/metformin is available as a generic medicine in the US. ===== SGLT2 inhibitors ===== There are combinations of metformin with the SGLT2 inhibitors dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and canagliflozin. ===== Sulfonylureas ===== Sulfonylureas act by increasing insulin release from the beta cells in the pancreas. A 2019 systematic review suggested that there is limited evidence if the combined use of metformin with sulfonylurea compared to the combination of metformin plus another glucose-lowering intervention, provides benefit or harm in mortality, severe adverse events, macrovascular and microvascular complications. Combined metformin and sulfonylurea therapy did appear to lead to a higher risk of hypoglycemia. Metformin is available combined with the sulfonylureas glipizide (Metaglip) and glibenclamide (US: glyburide) (Glucovance). Generic formulations of metformin/glipizide and metformin/glibenclamide are available (the latter is more popular). ===== Meglitinide ===== Meglitinides are similar to sulfonylureas, as they bind to beta cells in the pancreas, but differ by the site of binding to the intended receptor and the drugs' affinities to the receptor. As a result, they have a shorter duration of action compared to sulfonylureas and require higher blood glucose levels to begin to secrete insulin. Both meglitinides, known as nateglinide and repanglinide, are sold in formulations combined with metformin. A repaglinide/metformin combination is sold as Prandimet, or as its generic equivalent. ===== Triple combination ===== The combination of metformin with dapagliflozin and saxagliptin is available in the United States as Qternmet XR. The combination of metformin with pioglitazone and glibenclamide is available in India as Accuglim-MP, Adglim MP, and Alnamet-GP; and in the Philippines as Tri-Senza. The combination of metformin with pioglitazone and lipoic acid is available in Turkey as Pional. == Research == Metformin is a pleiotropic drug, with extensive off-target activity beyond its antidiabetic effect. Much of this has been attributed to its action on AMPK, although other mechanisms have been proposed. Metformin has been studied for its effects on multiple other conditions, including: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease Premature puberty Cancer Cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes Aging === Aging and life extension === No evidence shows that metformin extends the human lifespan. Despite that, metformin has received substantial interest as an agent that delays aging; it has been shown to increase longevity in some animal models (e.g., C. elegans and crickets). This effect may be mediated by insulin and carbohydrate regulation, similar to its effects on diabetes. Whether metformin may help extend life, even in otherwise healthy people, remains unknown; a 2021 review of the literature found it is likely to improve healthspan, i.e., the number of years spent in good health, rather than lifespan overall. A 2017 review found that people with diabetes who were taking metformin had lower all-cause mortality. They also had reduced cancer and cardiovascular disease compared with those on other therapies. In people without diabetes, metformin does not appear to reduce the risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease. === Cancer === The potential anticancer effects of metformin are believed to be mediated through multiple pathways, particularly involving AMPK activation and IGF-1R modulation. Research has focused particularly on stomach cancer, with evidence of protective impact (reducing the risk of cancer) and improving survival rates among patients in whom cancer has already developed. Despite promising findings, evidence is still preliminary and there is no consensus on its preventive and therapeutic role. === COVID-19 === A study found a benefit using metformin to reduce the occurrence of long COVID. It is unclear if there is a reduced risk of death using metformin to treat people with COVID-19. === Neurological and neurodegenerative disorders === There has been extensive research into the potential neuroprotective effects of metformin in developmental and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, certain types of epilepsy, and fragile X syndrome, with mixed results. Preliminary studies have examined whether metformin can reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease and whether there is a correlation between type 2 diabetes and the risk of Alzheimer's disease. While metformin may reduce body weight in persons with fragile X syndrome, whether it improves neurological or psychiatric symptoms is uncertain. === Derivatives === A derivative HL156A, also known as IM156, is a potential new drug for medical use. == References == == Further reading == == External links == \"Nitrosamine impurities in medications: Guidance\".

         " Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) represent a new class of drugs with tremendous potential for battling previously \"undruggable\" diseases. After nearly 2 decades of efforts in addressing the problems of the poor drug profile of naked unmodified siRNAs, this new modality has finally come to fruition, with 5 agents (patisiran, givosiran, lumasiran, inclisiran, and vutrisiran) being approved since 2018, and with many others in the different phases of clinical development. Unlike small-molecule drugs and protein therapeutics, siRNAs have different sizes, distinct mechanisms of action, differing physicochemical and pharmacological properties, and, accordingly, a unique pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship. To support the continuous development of siRNAs, it is important to have a thorough and deep understanding of the PK/PD and clinical pharmacology related features of siRNAs. As most of the current siRNA products are conjugated by N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), this review focuses on the PK/PD relationships and clinical pharmacology of GalNAc-conjugated siRNAs, including their absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion (ADME) properties, PK/PD models, drug-drug interactions, clinical pharmacology in special populations, and safety evaluation. In addition, necessary background information related to the development of siRNAs as a therapeutic modality, including the mechanisms of action, the advantages of siRNAs, the problems of naked siRNAs, as well as the strategies used to enhance the clinical utility of siRNAs, have also been covered. The goal of this review is to serve as a \"primer\" on siRNA PK/PD, and I hope the readers, especially those who have a limited background on siRNA therapeutics, will have a fundamental understanding of siRNA PK/PD and clinical pharmacology after reading this review. Short-interfering RNA (siRNA)-induced RNAi responses have great potential to treat a wide variety of human diseases from cancer to pandemic viral outbreaks to Parkinson's Disease. However, before siRNAs can become drugs, they must overcome a billion years of evolutionary defenses designed to keep invading RNAs on the outside cells from getting to the inside of cells. Not surprisingly, significant effort has been placed in developing a wide array of delivery technologies. Foremost of these has been the development of N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) siRNA conjugates for delivery to liver. Tris-GalNAc binds to the Asialoglycoprotein receptor that is highly expressed on hepatocytes resulting in rapid endocytosis. While the exact mechanism of escape across the endosomal lipid bilayer membrane remains unknown, sufficient amounts of siRNAs enter the cytoplasm to induce robust, target selective RNAi responses in vivo. Multiple GalNAc-siRNA conjugate clinical trials, including two phase III trials, are currently underway by three biotech companies to treat a wide variety of diseases. GalNAc-siRNA conjugates are a simple solution to the siRNA delivery problem for liver hepatocytes and have shown the RNAi (and antisense oligonucleotide) field the path forward for targeting other tissue types. One hallmark of trivalent N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc)-conjugated siRNAs is the remarkable durability of silencing that can persist for months in preclinical species and humans. Here, we investigated the underlying biology supporting this extended duration of pharmacological activity. We found that siRNA accumulation and stability in acidic intracellular compartments is critical for long-term activity. We show that functional siRNA can be liberated from these compartments and loaded into newly generated Argonaute 2 protein complexes weeks after dosing, enabling continuous RNAi activity over time. Identical siRNAs delivered in lipid nanoparticles or as GalNAc conjugates were dose-adjusted to achieve similar knockdown, but only GalNAc-siRNAs supported an extended duration of activity, illustrating the importance of receptor-mediated siRNA trafficking in the process. Taken together, we provide several lines of evidence that acidic intracellular compartments serve as a long-term depot for GalNAc-siRNA conjugates and are the major contributor to the extended duration of activity observed in vivo.",

         "mouse",
         "Valsartan, sold under the brand name Diovan among others, is a medication used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and diabetic kidney disease. It belongs to a class of medications referred to as angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs). It is a reasonable initial treatment for high blood pressure. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include feeling tired, dizziness, high blood potassium, diarrhea, and joint pain. Other serious side effects may include kidney problems, low blood pressure, and angioedema. Use in pregnancy may harm the baby and use when breastfeeding is not recommended. It is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist and works by blocking the effects of angiotensin II. Valsartan was patented in 1990, and came into medical use in 1996. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 117th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Valsartan is used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and to reduce death for people with left ventricular dysfunction after having a heart attack. === High blood pressure === Valsartan (and other ARBs) are an appropriate initial treatment option for most people with high blood pressure and no other coexisting conditions, as are ACE inhibitors, thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers. If patients have coexisting diabetes or kidney disease, ARBs or ACE inhibitors may be considered over other classes of blood pressure medicines. === Heart failure === Valsartan has reduced rates of mortality and heart failure hospitalisations when used alone or in combination with beta blockers in the treatment of heart failure. Importantly, the combination of valsartan and ACE inhibitors has not shown morbidity or mortality benefits but rather increases mortality risk when added to combination beta blocker and ACE inhibitor therapy, and increases the risk of adverse events like hyperkalaemia, hypotension and renal failure. As shown in the PARADIGM-HF study, valsartan combined with sacubitril for the treatment of heart failure, significantly reduced all cause and cardiovascular mortality and hospitalisations due to heart failure. === Diabetic kidney disease === In people with type 2 diabetes, antihypertensive therapy with valsartan decreases the rate of progression of albuminuria (albumin in urine), promotes regression to normoalbuminuria and may reduce the rate of progression to end-stage kidney disease. == Contraindications == The packaging for valsartan includes a warning stating the drug should not be used with the renin inhibitor aliskiren in people with diabetes. It also states the safety of the drug in severe renal impairment has not been established. Valsartan includes a black box warning for fetal toxicity. Discontinuation of these agents is recommended immediately after detection of pregnancy and an alternative medication should be started. Breastfeeding is not recommended. == Side effects == Side effects depend on the reason the medication is being used. === Heart failure === Adverse effects are based on a comparison versus placebo in people with heart failure. Most common side effects include dizziness (17% vs 9% ), low blood pressure (7% vs 2%), and diarrhea (5% vs 4%). Less common side effects include joint pain, fatigue, and back pain (all 3% vs 2%). === Hypertension === Clinical trials for valsartan treatment for hypertension versus placebo demonstrate side effects like viral infection (3% vs 2%), fatigue (2% vs 1%) and abdominal pain (2% vs 1%). Minor side effects that occurred at >1% but were similar to rates from the placebo group include: headache dizziness upper respiratory infection cough diarrhea rhinitis/sinusitis nausea pharyngitis edema arthralgia === Kidney failure === People treated with ARBs including valsartan or diuretics are susceptible to conditions of developing low renal blood flow such as abnormal narrowing of blood vessels in the kidney, hypertension, renal artery stenosis, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, severe congestive heart failure, or volume depletion whose renal function is in part dependent on the activity of the renin-angiotensin system like efferent arteriolar vasoconstriction done by angiotensin II are at high risk of deterioration of renal function comprising acute kidney failure, oliguria, worsening azotemia or heightened serum creatinine. When blood flow to the kidneys is reduced, the kidney activates a series of responses that triggers angiotensin release to constrict blood vessels and facilitate blood flow in the kidney. So long as the nephron function degradation is progressive or reaches clinically significant levels, withholding or discontinuing valsartan is warranted. == Interactions == The US prescribing information lists the following drug interactions for valsartan: Other inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system may increase the risks of low blood pressure, kidney problems, and hyperkalemia. Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium may increase the risk of hyperkalemia. NSAIDs may increase the risk of kidney problems and may interfere with blood pressure-lowering effects. Valsartan may increase the concentration of lithium. Valsartan and other angiotensin-related blood pressure medications may interact with the antibiotics co-trimoxazole or ciprofloxacin to increase risk of sudden death due to cardiac arrest. === Food interaction === With the tablet, food decreases the valsartan tablet taker's exposure to valsartan by about 40% and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50%, evidenced by AUC change. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Valsartan blocks the actions of angiotensin II, which include constricting blood vessels and activating aldosterone, to reduce blood pressure. The drug binds to angiotensin type I receptors (AT1), working as an antagonist. This mechanism of action is different than that of the ACE inhibitor drugs, which block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II. As valsartan acts at the receptor, it can provide more complete angiotensin II antagonism since angiotensin II is generated by other enzymes as well as ACE. Also, valsartan does not affect the metabolism of bradykinin like ACE inhibitors do. === Pharmacodynamics === === Pharmacokinetics === The peak concentration of valsartan in plasma occurs 2 to 4 hours after dosing. AUC and Cmax values of valsartan are observed to be approximately linearly dose-dependent over therapeutic dosing range. Owing to its relatively short elimination half life attribution, valsartan concentration in plasma does not accumulate in response to repeated dosing. == Society and culture == === Economics === In 2010, valsartan (trade name Diovan) achieved annual sales of $2.052 billion in the United States and $6.053 billion worldwide. The patents for valsartan and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide expired in September 2012. === Combinations === Versions are available as the combinations valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/amlodipine, valsartan/amlodipine/hydrochlorothiazide, valsartan/nebivolol, and valsartan/sacubitril. Valsartan is combined with amlodipine or hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) (or both) into single-pill formulations for treating hypertension with multiple drugs. Valsartan is also available as the combination valsartan/sacubitril. It is used to treat heart failure with reduced ejection fraction. === Recalls === In July 2018, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recalled certain batches of valsartan and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide film-coated tablets distributed in 22 countries in the European Union. Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical Co. (ZHP) in Linhai, China manufactured the bulk ingredient contaminated by N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), a carcinogen. The active pharmaceutical ingredient was subsequently imported by a number of generic drugmakers, including Novartis, and marketed in Europe and Asia under their subsidiary Sandoz labeling, and in the UK by Dexcel Pharma Ltd and Accord Healthcare. Valsartan was recalled in Canada. Authorities believe the degree of contamination is negligible. In July 2018, The National Agency of Drug and Food Control (NA-DFC or Badan POM Indonesia) announced voluntary recalls for two products containing valsartan produced by Actavis Indonesia and Dipa Pharmalab Intersains. In July 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced voluntary recalls of certain supplies of valsartan and valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide in the US distributed by Solco Healthcare LLC, Major Pharmaceuticals, and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries. Hong Kong's Department of Health initiated a similar recall. In August 2018, the FDA published two lengthy, updated lists, classifying hundreds of specific US products containing valsartan into those included versus excluded from the recall. A week later, the FDA cited two more drugmakers, Zhejiang Tianyu Pharmaceuticals of China and Hetero Labs Limited of India, as additional sources of the contaminated valsartan ingredient. In September 2018, the FDA announced that retesting of all valsartan supplies had found a second carcinogenic impurity, N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA), in the recalled products made by ZHP in China and marketed in the US under the Torrent Pharmaceuticals (India) brand. According to a 2018 Reuters analysis of national medicines agencies' records, more than 50 companies around the world have recalled valsartan mono-preparations or combination products manufactured from the tainted valsartan ingredient. The contamination has likely been present since 2012 when the manufacturing process was changed and approved by EDQM and FDA authorities. Based on inspections in late 2018, both agencies have suspended the Chinese and Indian manufacturers' certificates of suitability for the supply of valsartan in the EU and the US. In 2019, many more preparations of valsartan and its combinations were recalled due to the presence of the contaminant NDMA. In August 2020, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) provided guidance to marketing authorization holders on how to avoid the presence of nitrosamine impurities in human medicines and asked them to review all chemical and biological human medicines for the possible presence of nitrosamines and to test the products at risk. The FDA issued revised guidelines about nitrosamine impurities in September 2024. === Shortages === Since July 2018, numerous recalls of losartan, valsartan and irbesartan drug products have caused marked shortages of these life saving medications in North America and Europe, particularly for valsartan. In March 2019, the FDA approved an additional generic version of valsartan to address the issue. According to the agency, the shortage of valsartan was resolved in April 2020, but the availability of the generic form remained unstable into July 2020. Pharmacies in the European Union were notified that the supply of the drug, particularly for higher dosage forms, would remain unstable well into December 2020. == Research == In people with impaired glucose tolerance, valsartan may decrease the incidence of developing diabetes mellitus type 2. However, the absolute risk reduction is small (less than 1 percent per year) and diet, exercise or other drugs, may be more protective. In the same study, no reduction in the rate of cardiovascular events (including death) was shown. In one study of people without diabetes, valsartan reduced the risk of developing diabetes mellitus over amlodipine, mainly for those with hypertension. A prospective study demonstrated a reduction in the incidence and progression of Alzheimer's disease and dementia. == References ==",

         "Ursodoxicoltaurine is the international nonproprietary name (INN) for the pharmaceutical form of tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA). It is also known as taurursodiol. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid is a naturally occurring hydrophilic bile acid which is the taurine conjugated form of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). Humans have only trace amounts of tauroursodeoxycholic acid but bears have large amounts of tauroursodeoxycholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid in their bile. == Synthesis == Bile acids are naturally synthesized from cholesterol in the liver and are conjugated with specific amino-acids, specifically taurine. Bear bile contains several bile acids including taurochenodeoxycholic acid, ursodeoxycholic acid, and chenodeoxycholic acid. UDCA and its taurine conjugates comprise about 47% of the bile in American black bears and up to 76% in Asiatic bears. Ursodeoxycholic acid and tauroursodeoxycholic acid were first chemically synthesized in 1954 in Japan. Ursodeoxycholic acid is produced in several countries for the treatment of gallstones and primary biliary cholangitis. == Medical uses == In Canada and the United States, ursodoxicoltaurine, in combination with sodium phenylbutyrate, was indicated for the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Following failed results from the phase 3 PHOENIX trial (NCT05021536) It has been removed from the market in April 2024. Amylyx Pharmaceuticals has announced that effective immediately Relyvrio will no longer be available. == Cellular mechanisms == Apoptosis is largely influenced by the mitochondria. If the mitochondria are distressed, they release cytochrome C (cyC) and calcium which activate caspases to propagate a cascade of cellular mechanisms to cause apoptosis. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid prevents apoptosis with its role in the BAX pathway. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid prevents BAX from being transported to the mitochondria which protects the mitochondria from perturbation and the activation of caspases. Many effects of tauroursodeoxycholic acid appear to be dependent on the activation of the cell membrane receptors TGR5, S1PR2 and α5β1-Integrin. Tauroursodeoxycholic acid also acts as a chemical chaperone to help maintain the stability and correct folding of proteins. == Research == Ursodoxicoltaurine has been shown to reduce apoptosis and to have protective effects in neurodegenerative diseases and the eye, particularly for retinal degenerative disorders. Studies have shown that tauroursodeoxycholic acid has neuroprotective actions based on its potent ability to inhibit apoptosis, attenuate oxidative stress, and reduce endoplasmic reticulum stress in different experimental models of these illnesses. Studies have shown protective effects of tauroursodeoxycholic acid in eye diseases. === Photoreceptor cells === A study examined the effects of tauroursodeoxycholic acid on cones, in relation to retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a disease in which retinal rods and cones undergo apoptosis. Mice models were used, a wild-type and a mutant RP model, rd10. Both models were injected with tauroursodeoxycholic acid every 3 days from post-natal day 6 (p6) to p30 and compared to the vehicle. Electroretinography (ERG), photoreceptor cell counts, cone photoreceptor nuclei counts, and TUNEL labeling were all analyzed to show the effects of ursodoxicoltaurine. The dark-adapted and light-adapted ERG responses were greater in the ursodoxicoltaurine treated mouse than the vehicle treated mouse. Ursodoxicoltaurine treated mice also had more photoreceptor counts, yet non-altered retinal morphology or function. Even at P30, a stage where rod and cone function is usually greatly diminished in the rd10 mouse model, the photoreceptor function was protected. Another study, from the Department of Ophthalmology at Johns Hopkins University, in Baltimore, Maryland, saw similar effects in two components of bile, bilirubin and ursodoxicoltaurine, in relation to RP. Oxidative stress and prolonged light exposure were studied in rd10 mice and albino mice. In rd10 mice, intraperitoneal injections of bilirubin or ursodoxicoltaurine were given every 3 days starting at P6. This caused a considerable preservation in cone cell amount and function at P50, and a modest rod cell amount at P30. In the albino mice models, intraperitoneal injections of bilirubin or ursodoxicoltaurine were given prior to prolonged light exposure. Both treatments had positive effects on the health of the mouse retina, including a reduced accumulation of superoxide radicals, rod cell death, and disruption of cone inner and outer segments. The findings of the study are elucidating optimized conditions for RP treatment. === Choroidal neovascularization === A study done at the Department of Ophthalmology at Seoul National University College of Medicine examined the effects of ursodoxicoltaurine and UDCA on laser-treated choroids of rat models. Argon lasers were used to induce choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in rat models. Ursodoxicoltaurine and UDCA were injected intraperitoneally 24 hours before and daily after the laser treatment. Fourteen days after laser-treatment, the eyes were examined for effects. Fluorescein angiography showed lower leakage from the CNV in UDCA and ursodoxicoltaurine treated groups than the control group. Additionally, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels in the retina were examined and showed lower levels in the ursodoxicoltaurine treated group compared to the control group, whereas no effect in the UDCA treated group. ursodoxicoltaurine and UDCA may suppress CNV formation, which may be associated with its anti-inflammatory effects. === Synaptic connectivity === A study from the Department of Physiology in University of Alicante, in Alicante, Spain, shows the effects of ursodoxicoltaurine in the P23H transgenic rat, a model of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. The transgenic rats were injected with ursodoxicoltaurine once a week starting from P21 until P120, along with vehicle-administered controls. At P120, the functionality of the retina was examined via ERG and immunoflourescent microscopy. The amplitude of the a- and b- waves were considerably higher in ursodoxicoltaurine treated rats, compared to the control group. Photoreceptor density in the center of the retina was three-fold greater in ursodoxicoltaurine treated rats. Also, TUNEL results showed smaller amounts of TUNEL-positive cells. The synaptic contacts amongst photoreceptor cells, bipolar cells, and horizontal cells were preserved in the ursodoxicoltaurine treated P23H rats. Additionally, the synaptic terminals in the outer plexiform layer were of greater density that in control rats. The neuroprotective effects of ursodoxicoltaurine are not only preserving retinal morphology and function, but also its synaptic contacts, a potentially useful aspect in delaying RP. === Other diseases === Tauroursodeoxycholic acid has also been suggested to have potential application in heart disease, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and stroke in view of the drug's ability to reduce apoptotic effects. == References ==",

Aceglutamide is used as a psychostimulant and nootropic, while aceglutamide aluminium is used in the treatment of ulcers. Aceglutamide can also be used as a liquid-stable source of glutamine to prevent damage from protein energy malnutrition. The drug has shown neuroprotective effects in an animal model of cerebral ischemia. == See also == Aceburic acid Aceturic acid N-Acetylglutamic acid == References ==",

         "Azithromycin, sold under the brand names Zithromax (in oral form) and Azasite (as an eye drop), is an antibiotic medication used for the treatment of several bacterial infections. This includes middle ear infections, strep throat, pneumonia, traveler's diarrhea, and certain other intestinal infections. Along with other medications, it may also be used for malaria. It is administered by mouth, into a vein, or into the eye. Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and upset stomach. An allergic reaction, such as anaphylaxis, or a type of diarrhea caused by Clostridioides difficile is possible. Azithromycin causes QT prolongation that may cause life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. No harm has been found with its use during pregnancy. Its safety during breastfeeding is not confirmed, but it is likely safe. Azithromycin is an azalide, a type of macrolide antibiotic. It works by decreasing the production of protein, thereby stopping bacterial growth. Azithromycin was discovered in Yugoslavia (present day Croatia) in 1980 by the pharmaceutical company Pliva and approved for medical use in 1988. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The World Health Organization lists it as an example under \"Macrolides and ketolides\" in its Critically Important Antimicrobials for Human Medicine (designed to help manage antimicrobial resistance). It is available as a generic medication and is sold under many brand names worldwide. In 2022, it was the 78th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Azithromycin is used to treat diverse infections, including: Acute bacterial sinusitis due to H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, or S. pneumoniae. A 1999 study found Azithromycin to be faster in resolving symptoms as compared to amoxicillin / clavulanic. Acute otitis media caused by H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis or S. pneumoniae. A 2021 study concluded that Azithromycin was comparable to amoxicillin/clavulanate in its treatment and that it was safer and more tolerable in children. Community-acquired pneumonia due to C. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, M. pneumoniae, or S. pneumoniae. Genital ulcer disease (chancroid) in men due to H. ducreyi Pharyngitis or tonsillitis caused by S. pyogenes as an alternative to first-line therapy in individuals who cannot use first-line therapy Prevention and treatment of acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease due to H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, or S. pneumoniae. The benefits of long-term prophylaxis must be weighed on a patient-by-patient basis against the risk of cardiovascular and other adverse effects. Trachoma due to C. trachomatis Uncomplicated skin infections due to S. aureus, S. pyogenes, or S. agalactiae Whooping cough caused by B. pertussis. Scrub typhus caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi. === Bacterial susceptibility === Azithromycin has relatively broad but shallow antibacterial activity. It inhibits some Gram-positive bacteria, some Gram-negative bacteria, and many atypical bacteria. Aerobic and facultative Gram-positive microorganisms Staphylococcus aureus (Methicillin-sensitive only) Streptococcus agalactiae Streptococcus pneumoniae Streptococcus pyogenes Aerobic and facultative anaerobic Gram-negative microorganisms Bordetella pertussis Haemophilus ducreyi Haemophilus influenzae Legionella pneumophila Moraxella catarrhalis Neisseria gonorrhoeae Anaerobic microorganisms Peptostreptococcus species Prevotella bivia Other microorganisms Chlamydia trachomatis Chlamydophila pneumoniae Mycoplasma genitalium Mycoplasma pneumoniae Ureaplasma urealyticum === Pregnancy and breastfeeding === While some studies claim that no harm has been found with use during pregnancy, more recent studies with mice during late pregnancy has shown adverse effects on embryonic testicular and neural development of prenatal azithromycin exposure (PAzE) . One recent study claims obvious fetus changes were observed under high-dose, mid-pregnancy and multi-course exposure. However, there need to be more well-controlled studies in pregnant women. The safety of the medication during breastfeeding is unclear. It was reported that because only low levels are found in breast milk and the medication has also been used in young children, it is unlikely that breastfed infants would have adverse effects. === Airway diseases === Azithromycin has beneficial effects in the treatment of asthma. It possesses antibacterial, antiviral, and anti-inflammatory properties which contribute to its effectiveness. Asthma exacerbations can be caused by chronic neutrophilic inflammation, and azithromycin is known to reduce this type of inflammation due to its immunomodulatory properties. The recommended dosage for controlling asthma exacerbations with azithromycin is either 500 mg or 250 mg taken orally as tablets three times a week. In adults with severe asthma, low-dose azithromycin may be prescribed as an add-on treatment when standard therapies such as inhaled corticosteroids or long-acting beta2-agonists are not sufficient. Long-term use of azithromycin in patients with persistent symptomatic asthma aims to decrease the frequency of asthma exacerbations and improve their quality of life. While both its anti-inflammatory and antibacterial effects play crucial roles in treating asthma, studies suggest that responsiveness to azithromycin therapy depends on individual variations in lung bacterial burden and microbial composition, collectively referred to as the lung microbiome. The richness (diversity) of the lung microbiome has been identified as a key factor in determining the effectiveness of azithromycin treatment. Azithromycin has significant interactions with the patient's microbiome. Long-term use of azithromycin reduces the presence of H. influenzae bacteria in the airways but also increases resistance against macrolide antibiotics. The specific pharmacological mechanisms through which azithromycin interacts with the patient's microbiome remain unknown as of 2024; research continues to explore how changes in microbial composition influence drug efficacy and patient outcomes. Azithromycin appears to be effective in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease through its suppression of inflammatory processes. Azithromycin is potentially useful in sinusitis via this mechanism. Azithromycin is believed to produce its effects through suppressing certain immune responses that may contribute to inflammation of the airways. == Adverse effects == Most common adverse effects are diarrhea (5%), nausea (3%), abdominal pain (3%), and vomiting. Fewer than 1% of people stop taking the drug due to side effects. Nervousness, skin reactions, and anaphylaxis have been reported. Clostridioides difficile infection has been reported with use of azithromycin. Azithromycin does not affect the efficacy of birth control unlike some other antibiotics such as rifampin. Hearing loss has been reported. Occasionally, people have developed cholestatic hepatitis or delirium. Accidental intravenous overdose in an infant caused severe heart block, resulting in residual encephalopathy. In 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning that azithromycin \"can cause abnormal changes in the electrical activity of the heart that may lead to a potentially fatal irregular heart rhythm.\" The FDA noted in the warning a 2012 study that found the drug may increase the risk of death, especially in those with heart problems, compared with those on other antibiotics such as amoxicillin or no antibiotic. The warning indicated people with preexisting conditions are at particular risk, such as those with abnormalities in the QT interval, low blood levels of potassium or magnesium, a slower than normal heart rate, or those who use certain drugs to treat abnormal heart rhythms. The warning mentioned that azithromycin causes QT prolongation that may cause life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. == Interactions == === Colchicine === Azithromycin, should not be taken with colchicine as it may lead to colchicine toxicity. Symptoms of colchicine toxicity include gastrointestinal upset, fever, myalgia, pancytopenia, and organ failure. === Drugs metabolized by CYP3A4 === CYP3A4 is an enzyme that metabolizes many drugs in the liver. Some drugs can inhibit CYP3A4, which means they reduce its activity and increase the blood levels of the drugs that depend on it for elimination. This can lead to adverse effects or drug-drug interactions. Azithromycin is a member of macrolides that are a class of antibiotics with a cyclic structure with a lactone ring and sugar moieties. Macrolides can inhibit CYP3A4 by a mechanism called mechanism-based inhibition (MBI), which involves the formation of reactive metabolites that bind covalently and irreversibly to the enzyme, rendering it inactive. Mechanism-based inhibition is more serious and long-lasting than reversible inhibition, as it requires the synthesis of new enzyme molecules to restore the activity. The degree of mechanism-based inhibition by macrolides depends on the size and structure of their lactone ring. Clarithromycin and erythromycin have a 14-membered lactone ring, which is more prone to demethylation by CYP3A4 and subsequent formation of nitrosoalkenes, the reactive metabolites that cause mechanism-based inhibition. Azithromycin, on the other hand, has a 15-membered lactone ring, which is less susceptible to demethylation and nitrosoalkene formation. Therefore, azithromycin is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, while clarithromycin and erythromycin are strong inhibitors which increase the area under the curve (AUC) value of co-administered drugs more than five-fold. AUC it is a measure of the drug exposure in the body over time. By inhibiting CYP3A4, macrolide antibitiotics, such as erythromycin and clarithromycin, but not azithromycin, can significantly increase the AUC of the drugs that depend on it for clearance, which can lead to higher risk of adverse effects or drug-drug interactions. Azithromycin stands apart from other macrolide antibiotics because it is a weak inhibitor of CYP3A4, and does not significantly increase AUC value of co-administered drugs. The difference in CYP3A4 inhibition by macrolides has clinical implications, for example for people who take statins, which are cholesterol-lowering drugs that are mainly metabolized by CYP3A4. Co-administration of clarithromycin or erythromycin with statins can increase the risk of statin-induced myopathy, a condition that causes muscle pain and damage. Azithromycin, however, does not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of statins and is considered a safer alternative than other macrolide antibiotics. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Azithromycin prevents bacteria from growing by interfering with their protein synthesis. It binds to the 50S subunit of the bacterial ribosome, thus inhibiting translation of mRNA. Nucleic acid synthesis is not affected. === Pharmacokinetics === Azithromycin is an acid-stable antibiotic, so it can be taken orally with no need of protection from gastric acids. It is readily absorbed, but absorption is greater on an empty stomach. Time to peak concentration (Tmax) in adults is 2.1 to 3.2 hours for oral dosage forms. Due to its high concentration in phagocytes, azithromycin is actively transported to the site of infection. During active phagocytosis, large concentrations are released. The concentration of azithromycin in the tissues can be over 50 times higher than in plasma due to ion trapping and its high lipid solubility. Azithromycin's half-life allows a large single dose to be administered and yet maintain bacteriostatic levels in the infected tissue for several days. Following a single dose of 500 mg, the apparent terminal elimination half-life of azithromycin is 68 hours. Biliary excretion of azithromycin, predominantly unchanged, is a major route of elimination. Over the course of a week, about 6% of the administered dose appears as an unchanged drug in urine. == History == A team of researchers at the pharmaceutical company Pliva in Zagreb, Croatia discovered azithromycin in 1980. The company Pliva patented it in 1981. In 1986, Pliva and Pfizer signed a licensing agreement, which gave Pfizer exclusive rights for the sale of azithromycin in Western Europe and the United States. Pliva put its azithromycin on the market in Central and Eastern Europe. Pfizer launched azithromycin under Pliva's license in other markets under the brand name Zithromax in 1991. Patent protection ended in 2005. == Society and culture == === Available forms === Azithromycin is available as a generic medication. Azithromycin is administered in film-coated tablet, capsule, oral suspension, intravenous injection, granules for suspension in sachet, and ophthalmic solution. === Usage === In 2010, azithromycin was the most prescribed antibiotic for outpatients in the US, whereas in Sweden, where outpatient antibiotic use is a third as prevalent, macrolides are only on 3% of prescriptions. In 2017, and 2022, azithromycin was the second most prescribed antibiotic for outpatients in the United States. In 2022, it was the 78th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8 million prescriptions. === Brand names === == Research == Azithromycin is researched for its supposed anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, which are believed to be exhibited through its suppression of proinflammatory cytokines and enhancing the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, which is important in dampening inflammation. Cytokines are small proteins that are secreted by immune cells and play a key role in the immune response. Studies suggest that azithromycin can decrease the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-alpha, IL-1β, IL-6, and IL-8 while increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. By decreasing the number of pro-inflammatory cytokines, azithromycin probably controls potential tissue damage during inflammation. These effects are believed to be due to azithromycin's ability to suppress a transcription factor called nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) resulting in blockade of inflammatory response pathways downstream from NF-κB activation leading to decreased chemokine receptor CXCR4 signaling causing reduced inflammation. Despite the efficiency of treating rosacea with azithromycin, the exact mechanism of why azithromycin is effective in treating rosacea are not completely understood. It is unclear whether its antibacterial or immunomodulatory properties or a combination of both mechanisms contribute to its efficacy. Azithromycin may prevent mast cell degranulation and thus can suppress inflammation of dorsal root ganglia through various signaling pathways such as decreased numbers of CD4+ T cells which are particularly relevant since they mediate the response of hair follicle antigens. Inflammation in rosacea is thought to be associated with increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by inflammatory cells. The ability of azithromycin to decrease ROS production can help reduce oxidative stress and inflammation, but this remains speculation. The therapeutic role of azithromycin has been explored in various diseases such as cystic fibrosis exacerbation, burn injury-induced lung injury, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in COVID-19 infection. Despite early evidence showing azithromycin slowed down coronavirus multiplication in laboratory settings, further research indicates it to be ineffective as a treatment for COVID-19 in humans. Azithromycin in conjunction with chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine has been associated with deleterious outcomes in COVID-19 patients, including drug-induced QT prolongation. After a large-scale trial showed no benefit of using azithromycin in treating COVID-19, the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) updated its guidance and no longer recommends the medication for COVID-19. Azithromycin has been studied in the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and has been reported to improve or even resolve symptoms in some cases. However, these studies have been described as being of very low quality. In any case, the beneficial effects might be by eradication of chronic bacterial infections that are possibly contributing to or causing CFS or by the immunomodulatory effects of azithromycin. Azithromycin therapy in cystic fibrosis patients yields a modest respiratory function improvement, reduces exacerbation risk, and extends time to exacerbation up to six months; still, long-term efficacy data is a subject of ongoing research. Potential benefits of azithromycin therapy is azithromycin's good safety profile, minimal treatment burden, and cost-effectiveness, but the drawbacks are gastrointestinal side effects with weekly dosing, which are ameliorated by a split dose regimen. The potential role of azithromycin in inhibiting the autophagic destruction of non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) within macrophages has garnered significant attention. This mechanism may contribute to the observed correlation between long-term macrolide monotherapy and an increased risk of NTM infection and the emergence of macrolide-resistant strains. Azithromycin's interference with autophagy could potentially predispose patients with cystic fibrosis to mycobacterial infections. Despite repeated refutations of a direct association between azithromycin use and NTM infection, there remains a high level of concern regarding the potential for the development of NTM strains resistant to macrolides. Azithromycin has been shown to be an effective preventive measure against many postpartum infections in mothers following planned vaginal births; still, its impact on neonatal outcomes remains inconclusive and is the subject of ongoing research. == References == == See also == Zrinka Tamburašev, Croatian biochemist on the team that discovered azithromycin",

Abilities captured by the first- and second-stratum factors in the Cattel-Horn-Carroll (CHC) theory have been neglected. The focus has been on a narrow range of cognitive processes that excludes those common to some sensory modalities and a host of new tasks and constructs that have become available through recent conceptual analyses and technological developments. These new areas have emerged from psychology itself (complex problem solving tasks and emotional intelligence) and from disciplines related to psychology like education and economics (economic games and cognitive biases in decision-making).

         " Two experiments were conducted to investigate the production effects of N-acetyl-l-methionine (NALM; experiment 1) and to estimate its bioavailability (BA) and rumen escape (RE; experiment 2), respectively, in lactating dairy cows. In experiment 1, 18 multiparous Holstein cows were used in a replicated, 3 × 3 Latin square design experiment with three 28-d periods. Treatments were (1) basal diet estimated to supply 45 g/d digestible Met (dMet) or 1.47% of metabolizable protein (MP; control), (2) basal diet top-dressed with 32 g/d of NALM to achieve dMet supply of 2.2% of MP, and (3) basal diet top-dressed with 56 g/d of NALM to achieve dMet supply of 2.6% of MP. The NALM treatments supplied estimated 17 and 29 g/d dMet from NALM, respectively, based on manufacturer's specifications. In experiment 2, 4 rumen-cannulated lactating Holstein cows were used in a 4 × 4 Latin square design experiment with four 12-d periods. A 12-d period for baseline data collection and 4 d for determination of RE of NALM preceded the Latin square experiment. For determination of RE, 30 g of NALM were dosed into the rumen simultaneously with Cr-EDTA (used as a rumen fluid kinetics marker) and samples of ruminal contents were collected at 0 (before dosing), 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14, 18, and 24 h after dosing. Rumen escape of NALM was calculated using the estimated passage rate based on the measured Cr rate of disappearance. Bioavailability of abomasally dosed NALM was determined using the area under the curve of plasma Met concentration technique. Two doses of l-Met (providing 7.5 and 15 g of dMet) and 2 doses of NALM (11.2 and 14.4 g of dMet) were separately pulse-dosed into the abomasum of the cows and blood was collected from the jugular vein for Met concentration analysis at 0 (before dosing), 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, and 24 h after dosing. Supplementation of NALM did not affect DMI, milk yield, feed efficiency, or milk protein and lactose concentrations and yields in experiment 1. Milk fat concentration and energy-corrected milk yield decreased linearly with NALM dose. Plasma Met concentration was not affected by NALM dose. The estimated relative BA of abomasally dosed NALM (experiment 2) was 50% when dosed at 14.4 g/cow (11.2 g/d dMet from NALM) and 24% when dosed at 28.8 g/cow (14.4 g/d dMet from NALM). The estimated RE of NALM was 19% based on the measured k Neutral amino acids can be delivered into cells through the l-type amino acid transporter-1 (LAT1), which is a sodium independent transporter. The LAT1 protein is expressed in different tissues, including kidney, blood brain barrier and intestinal wall hence LAT1 can be used as a target in diseases associated with its overexpression. In-silico interactions between different ligands, including methionine (Met), N-acetyl-l-methionine (AcMet), hyaluronic acid (HA), grafted hyaluronic-acid l-methionine (HA-ADH-Met) and a novel grafted hyaluronic acid-N-acetyl-l-methionine (HA-ADH-AcMet), which are at the active site of the LAT1 transporter, were studied and the binding energies calculated. The HA-ADH-AcMet complex demonstrated binding energy and solvation energy of -74.84 and 81.46 kcal/mol, respectively, thus validating its potential to be synthesized. The structural conformation of the HA-ADH-AcMet was confirmed using  Methionine plays a vital role in protein synthesis, and regulation of antioxidant response in ruminants. This study aimed to assess the effects of dietary supplementation with N-acetyl-l-methionine (NALM), which serves a source of rumen-protected methionine, on growth performance, carcass traits, meat quality, and oxidative stability. Sixty Angus heifers (initial body weight = 408 ± 51.2 kg, 15-18 months) were stratified by body weight and randomly assigned to four dietary treatments: a control group (0% NALM), and experimental groups receiving diets containing 0.125%, 0.25%, and 0.50% NALM (dry matter (DM) basis), respectively. The experiment included a 2-week adaptation and a 22-week data and sample collection period. Results indicated that blood urea nitrogen in the plasma of the 0.25% NALM group was lower compared to the control and the 0.50% NALM groups (P = 0.02). The plasma methionine (P = 0.04), proline (P < 0.01), and tryptophan (P = 0.05) were higher in the 0.25% and 0.50% NALM groups, as well as the methionine and proline in the muscle of the 0.25% NALM group (P < 0.01). The muscle pH (P < 0.01) was increased by supplementing 0.25% and 0.50% NALM in diets but decreased the lactate (P < 0.01). The 0.25% NALM group also increased a* (P = 0.05), decreased L* (P = 0.05), drip loss (P = 0.01), and glycolytic potential in the muscle (P < 0.01). The total antioxidant capacity, superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and glutathione in muscle of 0.25% NALM group were higher than that of the control (P < 0.01), and the malondialdehyde and protein carbonyl were lower (P < 0.01). In conclusion, the dietary supplement with NALM improves meat quality by enhancing the antioxidant effect of lipids and proteins.",

         " In this study, lipase-catalyzed resolution of N-acetyl-DL-methionine methyl ester (N-Ac-DL-MetOMe) was evaluated. A lipase from Brucella thiophenivorans was prone to exhibit high activity and excellent enantioselectivity toward N-Ac-DL-MetOMe to produce the key chiral intermediate N-acetyl-L-methionine methyl ester (N-Ac-L-MetOMe). The results showed that the enzymatic reaction was carried out in 100 g/L racemic substrate for 2 h, the conversion reached 51.3%, the enantiomeric excess value N-Ac-L-MetOMe exceeded 99%, and the enantiomeric ratio value >200. Therefore, the lipase from B. thiophenivorans has potential prospects for the resolution of N-Ac-DL-MetOMe to produce the important intermediate N-Ac-L-MetOMe. Bulk size single crystal of N-acetyl DL-methionine (C7H13NO3S) (1) was grown using a home-made crystal growth setup (MKN setup). The identity of the grown crystal was confirmed by single crystal X-ray diffraction. The modes of vibrations of the functional groups present were assigned using the infrared (IR) spectrum. UV-vis-NIR spectra showed that the crystals have excellent transparency in the visible and infrared regions. The thermal stability and decomposition of the sample was studied by using thermal analysis (TGA/DTA). Photoluminescence excitation studies showed that the emission occurred at 350 nm for the compound.",

Diagnosing it has been difficult because of a lack of fast and reliable diagnostic methods. We developed a stable-isotope dilution method to measure urinary n-hexanoylglycine, 3-phenylpropionylglycine, and suberylglycine, and we retrospectively tested its accuracy in diagnosing MCAD deficiency. We measured the concentrations of these three acylglycines in 54 urine samples from 21 patients with confirmed MCAD deficiency during the acute and asymptomatic phases of the illness and compared the results with the concentrations in 98 samples from healthy controls and patient controls with various diseases. The levels of urinary hexanoylglycine and phenylpropionylglycine were significantly increased in all samples from the patients with MCAD deficiency, clearly distinguishing them from both groups of controls. Although urinary suberylglycine was increased in the patients, the range of values in the normal controls who were receiving formula containing medium-chain triglycerides was very wide, overlapping somewhat with the values in the patients with asymptomatic MCAD deficiency. These results indicate that the measurement of urinary hexanoylglycine and phenylpropionylglycine by our method is highly specific for the diagnosis of MCAD deficiency.

         "Adenosine (symbol A) is an organic compound that occurs widely in nature in the form of diverse derivatives. The molecule consists of an adenine attached to a ribose via a β-N9-glycosidic bond. Adenosine is one of the four nucleoside building blocks of RNA (and its derivative deoxyadenosine is a building block of DNA), which are essential for all life on Earth. Its derivatives include the energy carriers adenosine mono-, di-, and triphosphate, also known as AMP/ADP/ATP. Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is pervasive in signal transduction. Adenosine is used as an intravenous medication for some cardiac arrhythmias. Adenosyl (abbreviated Ado or 5'-dAdo) is the chemical group formed by removal of the 5′-hydroxy (OH) group. It is found in adenosylcobalamin (an active form of vitamin B12) and as a radical in the radical SAM enzymes. == Medical uses == === Supraventricular tachycardia === In individuals with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), adenosine is a first line treatment used to help identify and convert the rhythm. Certain SVTs can be successfully terminated with adenosine. This includes any re-entrant arrhythmias that require the AV node for the re-entry, e.g., AV reentrant tachycardia (AVRT) and AV nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). In addition, atrial tachycardia can sometimes be terminated with adenosine. Fast rhythms of the heart that are confined to the atria (e.g., atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter) or ventricles (e.g., monomorphic ventricular tachycardia), and do not involve the AV node as part of the re-entrant circuit, are not typically converted by adenosine. However, the ventricular response rate is temporarily slowed with adenosine in such cases. Because of the effects of adenosine on AV node-dependent SVTs, adenosine is considered a class V antiarrhythmic agent. When adenosine is used to cardiovert an abnormal rhythm, it is normal for the heart to enter ventricular asystole for a few seconds. This can be disconcerting to a normally conscious patient, and is associated with angina-like sensations in the chest. === Nuclear stress test === Adenosine is used as an adjunct to thallium (TI 201) or technetium (Tc99m) myocardial perfusion scintigraphy (nuclear stress test) in patients unable to undergo adequate stress testing with exercise. === Dosage === When used to treat SVT, adenosine is administered intravenously as a rapid bolus (typically 0.10–0.15 mg/kg initially) over 1-2 seconds, followed by a rapid saline flush (often using a 2-way or 3-way stopcock). If the initial dose is ineffective, it may be repeated every 2 minutes with a slightly increased dose (0.05–0.1 mg/kg increments) every 2 minutes up to a maximum total dose of 0.3 mg/kg (not exceeding 12 mg). Due to adenosine's extremely short half-life (less than 10 seconds), it is often injected through a central venous line or a large proximal peripheral vein; administration into lower extremities, PICC lines, or smaller veins may lead to therapeutic failure due to rapid metabolism before reaching the heart. When given to dilate the arteries, such as in a \"stress test\", the dosage is typically 0.14 mg/kg/min, administered for 4 or 6 minutes, depending on the protocol. The recommended dose may be increased in patients on theophylline since methylxanthines prevent binding of adenosine at receptor sites. The dose is often decreased in patients on dipyridamole (Persantine) and diazepam (Valium) because adenosine potentiates the effects of these drugs. The recommended dose is also reduced by half in patients presenting congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, shock, hypoxia, and/or chronic liver disease or chronic kidney disease, and in elderly patients. == Adverse effects == Adverse effects associated with adenosine administration are primarily due to its activation of adenosine receptors on vascular tissue, resulting in vasodilation. Side effects of adenosine include skin flushing, lightheadedness, nausea, sweating, nervousness, numbness, and a sense of impending doom. These effects are typically very short-lived due to adenosine's rapid metabolism and short half-life. Less common, but more serious, cardiovascular effects can occur, such as cardiac arrhythmias (including premature atrial and ventricular contractions and atrioventricular (AV) block), hypotension, cardiac ischemia, and prolonged asystole. == Drug interactions == Dipyridamole potentiates the action of adenosine, requiring the use of lower doses. Methylxanthines (e.g. caffeine found in coffee, theophylline found in tea, or theobromine found in chocolate) have a purine structure and bind to some of the same receptors as adenosine. Methylxanthines act as competitive antagonists of adenosine and can blunt its pharmacological effects. Individuals taking large quantities of methylxanthines may require increased doses of adenosine. Caffeine acts by blocking binding of adenosine to the adenosine A1 receptor, which enhances release of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Caffeine also increases cyclic AMP levels through nonselective inhibition of phosphodiesterase. \"Caffeine has a three-dimensional structure similar to that of adenosine,\" which allows it to bind and block its receptors. == Contraindications == Common contraindications for adenosine include Asthma, traditionally considered an absolute contraindication. This is being contested, and it is now considered a relative contraindication (however, selective adenosine antagonists are being investigated for use in treatment of asthma) == Pharmacological effects == Adenosine is an endogenous purine nucleoside that modulates many physiological processes. Cellular signaling by adenosine occurs through four known adenosine receptor subtypes (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3). Extracellular adenosine concentrations from normal cells are approximately 300 nM; however, in response to cellular damage (e.g., in inflammatory or ischemic tissue), these concentrations are quickly elevated (600–1,200 nM). Thus, in regard to stress or injury, the function of adenosine is primarily that of cytoprotection preventing tissue damage during instances of hypoxia, ischemia, and seizure activity. Activation of A2A receptors produces a constellation of responses that in general can be classified as anti-inflammatory. Enzymatic production of adenosine can be anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive. === Adenosine receptors === All adenosine receptor subtypes (A1, A2A, A2B, and A3) are G-protein-coupled receptors. The four receptor subtypes are further classified based on their ability to either stimulate or inhibit adenylate cyclase activity. The A1 receptors couple to Gi/o and decrease cAMP levels, while the A2 adenosine receptors couple to Gs, which stimulates adenylate cyclase activity. In addition, A1 receptors couple to Go, which has been reported to mediate adenosine inhibition of Ca2+ conductance, whereas A2B and A3 receptors also couple to Gq and stimulate phospholipase activity. Researchers at Cornell University have recently shown adenosine receptors to be key in opening the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Mice dosed with adenosine have shown increased transport across the BBB of amyloid plaque antibodies and prodrugs associated with Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, and cancers of the central nervous system. === Ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor === Adenosine is an endogenous agonist of the ghrelin/growth hormone secretagogue receptor. However, while it is able to increase appetite, unlike other agonists of this receptor, adenosine is unable to induce the secretion of growth hormone and increase its plasma levels. === Mechanism of action === When it is administered intravenously, adenosine causes transient heart block in the atrioventricular (AV) node. This is mediated via the A1 receptor, inhibiting adenylyl cyclase, reducing cAMP and so causing cell hyperpolarization by increasing K+ efflux via inward rectifier K+ channels, subsequently inhibiting Ca2+ current. It also causes endothelial-dependent relaxation of smooth muscle as is found inside the artery walls. This causes dilation of the \"normal\" segments of arteries, i.e. where the endothelium is not separated from the tunica media by atherosclerotic plaque. This feature allows physicians to use adenosine to test for blockages in the coronary arteries, by exaggerating the difference between the normal and abnormal segments. The administration of adenosine also reduces blood flow to coronary arteries past the occlusion. Other coronary arteries dilate when adenosine is administered while the segment past the occlusion is already maximally dilated, which is a process called coronary steal. This leads to less blood reaching the ischemic tissue, which in turn produces the characteristic chest pain. == Metabolism == Adenosine used as a second messenger can be the result of de novo purine biosynthesis via adenosine monophosphate (AMP), though it is possible other pathways exist. When adenosine enters the circulation, it is broken down by adenosine deaminase, which is present in red blood cells and the vessel wall. Dipyridamole, an inhibitor of adenosine nucleoside transporter, allows adenosine to accumulate in the blood stream. This causes an increase in coronary vasodilatation. Adenosine deaminase deficiency is a known cause of immunodeficiency. == Research == === Viruses === The adenosine analog NITD008 has been reported to directly inhibit the recombinant RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of the dengue virus by terminating its RNA chain synthesis. This interaction suppresses peak viremia and rise in cytokines and prevents lethality in infected animals, raising the possibility of a new treatment for this flavivirus. The 7-deaza-adenosine analog has been shown to inhibit the replication of the hepatitis C virus. BCX4430 is protective against Ebola and Marburg viruses. Such adenosine analogs are potentially clinically useful since they can be taken orally. === Anti-inflammatory properties === Adenosine is believed to be an anti-inflammatory agent at the A2A receptor. Topical treatment of adenosine to foot wounds in diabetes mellitus has been shown in lab animals to drastically increase tissue repair and reconstruction. Topical administration of adenosine for use in wound-healing deficiencies and diabetes mellitus in humans is currently under clinical investigation. Methotrexate's anti-inflammatory effect may be due to its stimulation of adenosine release. === Central nervous system === In general, adenosine has an inhibitory effect in the central nervous system (CNS). Caffeine's stimulatory effects are credited primarily (although not entirely) to its capacity to block adenosine receptors, thereby reducing the inhibitory tonus of adenosine in the CNS. This reduction in adenosine activity leads to increased activity of the neurotransmitters dopamine and glutamate. Experimental evidence suggests that adenosine and adenosine agonists can activate Trk receptor phosphorylation through a mechanism that requires the adenosine A2A receptor. === Hair === Adenosine has been shown to promote thickening of hair on people with thinning hair. A 2013 study compared topical adenosine with minoxidil in male androgenetic alopecia, finding it was as potent as minoxidil (in overall treatment outcomes) but with higher satisfaction rate with patients due to “faster prevention of hair loss and appearance of the newly grown hairs” (further trials were called for to clarify the findings). === Sleep === Adenosine is a key factor in regulating the body's sleep-wake cycle. Adenosine levels rise during periods of wakefulness and lowers during sleep. Higher adenosine levels correlate with a stronger feeling of sleepiness, also known as sleep drive or sleep pressure. Cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which is considered one of the most effective treatments for insomnia, utilizes short-term sleep deprivation to raise and regulate adenosine levels in the body, for the intended promotion of consistent and sustained sleep in the long term. A principal component of cannabis delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) induces sleep in rats by increasing adenosine levels in the basal forebrain. These components also significantly increase slow-wave sleep during the sleep cycle, mediated by CB1 receptor activation. These findings identify a potential therapeutic use of cannabinoids to induce sleep in conditions where sleep may be severely attenuated. == Vasodilation == It also plays a role in regulation of blood flow to various organs through vasodilation. == See also == Adenosine receptor Adenosine reuptake inhibitor List of growth hormone secretagogues == References ==",

         "Histidine (symbol His or H) is an essential amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. It contains an α-amino group (which is in the protonated –NH3+ form under biological conditions), a carboxylic acid group (which is in the deprotonated –COO− form under biological conditions), and an imidazole side chain (which is partially protonated), classifying it as a positively charged amino acid at physiological pH. Initially thought essential only for infants, it has now been shown in longer-term studies to be essential for adults also. It is encoded by the codons CAU and CAC. Histidine was first isolated by Albrecht Kossel and Sven Gustaf Hedin in 1896. The name stems from its discovery in tissue, from ἱστός histós \"tissue\". It is also a precursor to histamine, a vital inflammatory agent in immune responses. The acyl radical is histidyl. == Properties of the imidazole side chain == The conjugate acid (protonated form) of the imidazole side chain in histidine has a pKa of approximately 6.0. Thus, below a pH of 6, the imidazole ring is mostly protonated (as described by the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation). The resulting imidazolium ring bears two NH bonds and has a positive charge. The positive charge is equally distributed between both nitrogens and can be represented with two equally important resonance structures. Sometimes, the symbol Hip is used for this protonated form instead of the usual His. Above pH 6, one of the two protons is lost. The remaining proton of the imidazole ring can reside on either nitrogen, giving rise to what are known as the N3-H or N1-H tautomers. The N3-H tautomer is shown in the figure above. In the N1-H tautomer, the NH is nearer the backbone. These neutral tautomers, also referred to as Nε (or Nτ) and Nδ (or Nπ), are sometimes referred to with symbols Hie and Hid, respectively. The imidazole/imidazolium ring of histidine is aromatic at all pH values. Under certain conditions, all three ion-forming groups of histidine can be charged forming the histidinium cation. The acid-base properties of the imidazole side chain are relevant to the catalytic mechanism of many enzymes. In catalytic triads, the basic nitrogen of histidine abstracts a proton from serine, threonine, or cysteine to activate it as a nucleophile. In a histidine proton shuttle, histidine is used to quickly shuttle protons. It can do this by abstracting a proton with its basic nitrogen to make a positively charged intermediate and then use another molecule, a buffer, to extract the proton from its acidic nitrogen. In carbonic anhydrases, a histidine proton shuttle is utilized to rapidly shuttle protons away from a zinc-bound water molecule to quickly regenerate the active form of the enzyme. In helices E and F of hemoglobin, histidine influences binding of dioxygen as well as carbon monoxide. This interaction enhances the affinity of Fe(II) for O2 but destabilizes the binding of CO, which binds only 200 times stronger in hemoglobin, compared to 20,000 times stronger in free heme. The tautomerism and acid-base properties of the imidazole side chain has been characterized by 15N NMR spectroscopy. The two 15N chemical shifts are similar (about 200 ppm, relative to nitric acid on the sigma scale, on which increased shielding corresponds to increased chemical shift). NMR spectral measurements shows that the chemical shift of N1-H drops slightly, whereas the chemical shift of N3-H drops considerably (about 190 vs. 145 ppm). This change indicates that the N1-H tautomer is preferred, possibly due to hydrogen bonding to the neighboring ammonium. The shielding at N3 is substantially reduced due to the second-order paramagnetic effect, which involves a symmetry-allowed interaction between the nitrogen lone pair and the excited π* states of the aromatic ring. At pH > 9, the chemical shifts of N1 and N3 are approximately 185 and 170 ppm. === Ligand === Histidine forms complexes with many metal ions. The imidazole sidechain of the histidine residue commonly serves as a ligand in metalloproteins. One example is the axial base attached to Fe in myoglobin and hemoglobin. Poly-histidine tags (of six or more consecutive H residues) are utilized for protein purification by binding to columns with nickel or cobalt, with micromolar affinity. Natural poly-histidine peptides, found in the venom of the viper Atheris squamigera have been shown to bind Zn(II), Ni(II) and Cu(II) and affect the function of venom metalloproteases. N-terminal histidines are known to function as bidentate ligands, with a metal (generally copper) bound to both the amine of the N-terminus and the Nε of the histidine; the Nδ is often methylated. Although recently discovered, this \"histidine brace\" motif is critical in biogeochemical cycles: it functions as the active site of lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs), which break down unreactive polysaccharides such as cellulose. It is proposed that the evolution of these enzymes in fungi corresponds to the first widespread ability to decompose woody plant mass, leading to the end of the Carboniferous era and its mass accumulation of coal deposits. == Metabolism == === Biosynthesis === l-Histidine is an essential amino acid that is not synthesized de novo in humans. Humans and other animals must ingest histidine or histidine-containing proteins. The biosynthesis of histidine has been widely studied in prokaryotes such as E. coli. Histidine synthesis in E. coli involves eight gene products (His1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8) and it occurs in ten steps. This is possible because a single gene product has the ability to catalyze more than one reaction. For example, as shown in the pathway, His4 catalyzes 4 different steps in the pathway. Histidine is synthesized from phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP), which is made from ribose-5-phosphate by ribose-phosphate diphosphokinase in the pentose phosphate pathway. The first reaction of histidine biosynthesis is the condensation of PRPP and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by the enzyme ATP-phosphoribosyl transferase. ATP-phosphoribosyl transferase is indicated by His1 in the image. His4 gene product then hydrolyzes the product of the condensation, phosphoribosyl-ATP, producing phosphoribosyl-AMP (PRAMP), which is an irreversible step. His4 then catalyzes the formation of phosphoribosylformiminoAICAR-phosphate, which is then converted to phosphoribulosylformimino-AICAR-P by the His6 gene product. His7 splits phosphoribulosylformimino-AICAR-P to form d-erythro-imidazole-glycerol-phosphate. After, His3 forms imidazole acetol-phosphate releasing water. His5 then makes l-histidinol-phosphate, which is then hydrolyzed by His2 making histidinol. His4 catalyzes the oxidation of l-histidinol to form l-histidinal, an amino aldehyde. In the last step, l-histidinal is converted to l-histidine. The histidine biosynthesis pathway has been studied in the fungus Neurospora crassa, and a gene (His-3) encoding a multienzyme complex was found that was similar to the His4 gene of the bacterium E. coli. A genetic study of N. crassa histidine mutants indicated that the individual activities of the multienzyme complex occur in discrete, contiguous sections of the His-3 genetic map, suggesting that the different activities of the multienzyme complex are encoded separately from each other. However, mutants were also found that lacked all three activities simultaneously, suggesting that some mutations cause loss of function of the complex as a whole. Just like animals and microorganisms, plants need histidine for their growth and development. Microorganisms and plants are similar in that they can synthesize histidine. Both synthesize histidine from the biochemical intermediate phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate. In general, the histidine biosynthesis is very similar in plants and microorganisms. ==== Regulation of biosynthesis ==== This pathway requires energy in order to occur therefore, the presence of ATP activates the first enzyme of the pathway, ATP-phosphoribosyl transferase (shown as His1 in the image on the right). ATP-phosphoribosyl transferase is the rate determining enzyme, which is regulated through feedback inhibition meaning that it is inhibited in the presence of the product, histidine. === Degradation === Histidine is one of the amino acids that can be converted to intermediates of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle). Histidine, along with other amino acids such as proline and arginine, takes part in deamination, a process in which its amino group is removed. In prokaryotes, histidine is first converted to urocanate by histidase. Then, urocanase converts urocanate to 4-imidazolone-5-propionate. Imidazolonepropionase catalyzes the reaction to form formiminoglutamate (FIGLU) from 4-imidazolone-5-propionate. The formimino group is transferred to tetrahydrofolate, and the remaining five carbons form glutamate. Overall, these reactions result in the formation of glutamate and ammonia. Glutamate can then be deaminated by glutamate dehydrogenase or transaminated to form α-ketoglutarate. === Conversion to other biologically active amines === The histidine amino acid is a precursor for histamine, an amine produced in the body necessary for inflammation. The enzyme histidine ammonia-lyase converts histidine into ammonia and urocanic acid. A deficiency in this enzyme is present in the rare metabolic disorder histidinemia, producing urocanic aciduria as a key diagnostic finding. Histidine can be converted to 3-methylhistidine, which serves as a biomarker for skeletal muscle damage, by certain methyltransferase enzymes. Histidine is also a precursor for carnosine biosynthesis, which is a dipeptide found in skeletal muscle. In Actinomycetota and filamentous fungi, such as Neurospora crassa, histidine can be converted into the antioxidant ergothioneine. == Requirements == The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the U.S. Institute of Medicine set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for essential amino acids in 2002. For histidine, for adults 19 years and older, 14 mg/kg body weight/day. Supplemental histidine is being investigated for use in a variety of different conditions, including neurological disorders, atopic dermatitis, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, uraemic anaemia, ulcers, inflammatory bowel diseases, malignancies, and muscle performance during strenuous exercise. == See also == Carnosinemia Beta-Alanine Diphthamide Pauly reaction == References == == External links == Histidine MS Spectrum",

         " To assess the efficacy and tolerability of acetyl-L-carnitine (levacecarnine; LAC) versus placebo in the treatment of diabetic neuropathy, mainly by evaluating the effects of treatment on electrophysiological parameters and pain symptoms. This was a multicentre (n = 20), randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study. 333 patients meeting clinical and/or neurophysiological criteria for diabetic neuropathy were enrolled. Patients were randomised to treatment with LAC or placebo. LAC (or placebo) was started intramuscularly at a dosage of 1000 mg/day for 10 days and continued orally at a dosage of 2000 mg/day for the remainder of the study (355 days). MAIN OUTCOME PARAMETERS AND RESULTS: The main efficacy parameter was the effect of treatment on 6- and 12-month changes from baseline in nerve conduction velocity (NCV) and amplitude in the sensory (ulnar, sural and median) and motor (median, ulnar and peroneal) nerves. The effect of treatment on pain was also evaluated by means of a visual analogue scale (VAS). Among the 294 patients with impaired electrophysiological parameters at baseline, those treated with LAC showed a statistically significant improvement in mean NCV and amplitude compared with placebo (p < 0.01). The greatest changes in NCV (at 12 months) were observed in the sensory sural nerve (7 m/sec in the LAC group vs +1.0 m/sec in the placebo group), sensory ulnar nerve (+2.9 vs +0.1 m/sec, respectively) and motor peroneal nerve (+2.7 vs -0.2 m/sec), whereas the greatest changes in amplitude were recorded in the motor peroneal nerve (+2.2 vs +0.1 mV). After 12 months of treatment, mean VAS scores for pain were significantly reduced from baseline by 39% in LAC-treated patients (p < 0.0 vs baseline) compared with 8% in placebo recipients. LAC was well tolerated over the study period. LAC was effective and well tolerated in improving neurophysiological parameters and in reducing pain over a 1-year period. LAC is, therefore, a promising treatment option in patients with diabetic neuropathy.",

         " Checkpoint inhibitor pneumonitis (CIP) is a potentially fatal adverse event characterized by new pulmonary infiltrates in cancer patients receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. This study aims to explore the interplay between lung microbiota, dysregulated metabolites, and host immunity in CIP. We recruited thirteen hospitalized CIP patients, eleven idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients, and ten new-onset non-small cell lung cancer patients. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples were collected for 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The percentages of immune cells were determined using manual counting and flow cytometry. Interactions among microbiota, metabolites, and lymphocytes were analyzed using cultured mouse splenocytes and human T cells. Proteobacteria emerged as the dominant phylum, notably abundant in both the CIP and IPF groups. Vibrio, Halomonas, Mangrovibacter, and Salinivibrio were the predominant microbiota because of their discriminative abundance patterns. Vibrio (r = 0.72, P-adj = 0.007) and Halomonas (r = 0.65, P-adj = 0.023) demonstrated strong correlations with lymphocytes. Vibrio metschnikovii and Mangrovibacter plantisponsors were more abundant in the CIP group than in the IPF group. Lauroylcarnitine, a key intermediary metabolite co-occurring with the predominant microbiota, exhibited a potent effect on cytokine secretion by mouse and human T cells, notably enhancing IFN-γ and TNF-α production from CD4 and CD8 cells in vitro. Lauroylcarnitine, co-occurring with the predominant lung microbiota in CIP, could activate T cells in vitro. These findings suggest potential involvement of lung microbiota and acylcarnitine metabolism dysregulation in the pathogenesis of CIP. This work was supported by Peking University People's Hospital Scientific Research Development Funds (RDJ2022-15) and Provincial Key Clinical Specialty Capacity Building Project 2020 (Department of the Respiratory Medicine). We investigated optimum formulation characteristics in the nasal absorption of salmon calcitonin (sCT) by incorporation of acylcarnitines. Nasal sCT formulations were administered to anesthetized rats. Plasma calcium level was measured and pharmacological bioavailability (P.bioav) was calculated. Nasal sCT absorption was significantly enhanced by carnitines with acyl groups of 12 or more carbon atoms. Enhancement by lauroylcarnitine chloride (LCC) was observed at its critical micelle concentration and reached a plateau at the concentration of 0.1 percent. Optimal absorption was achieved at a molar ratio of LCC to sCT of 5:1. Enhancement was not influenced by osmolarity and maximum enhancement was obtained at pHs 3.1 and 4.0. The 12-carbon LCC was the strongest enhancer among acylcarnitines. Micelle formation played a key role in this enhancement effect.",

         " Trimethyllysine is an important post-translationally modified amino acid with functions in the carnitine biosynthesis and regulation of key epigenetic processes. Protein lysine methyltransferases and demethylases dynamically control protein lysine methylation, with each state of methylation changing the biophysical properties of lysine and the subsequent effect on protein function, in particular histone proteins and their central role in epigenetics. Epigenetic reader domain proteins can distinguish between different lysine methylation states and initiate downstream cellular processes upon recognition. Dysregulation of protein methylation is linked to various diseases, including cancer, inflammation, and genetic disorders. In this review, we cover biomolecular studies on the role of trimethyllysine in carnitine biosynthesis, different enzymatic reactions involved in the synthesis and removal of trimethyllysine, trimethyllysine recognition by reader proteins, and the role of trimethyllysine on the nucleosome assembly. Background Trimethyllysine, a trimethylamine N-oxide precursor, has been identified as an independent cardiovascular risk factor in acute coronary syndrome. However, limited data are available to examine the role of trimethyllysine in the population with stroke. We aimed to examine the relationship between plasma trimethyllysine levels and stroke outcomes in patients presenting with ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack. Methods and Results Data of 10 027 patients with ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack from the CNSR-III (Third China National Stroke Registry) and 1-year follow-up data for stroke outcomes were analyzed. Plasma levels of trimethyllysine were measured with mass spectrometry. The association between trimethyllysine and stroke outcomes was analyzed using Cox regression models. Mediation analysis was performed to examine the mediation effects of risk factors on the associations of trimethyllysine and stroke outcomes. Elevated trimethyllysine levels were associated with increased risk of cardiovascular death (quartile 4 versus quartile 1: adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.72; 95% CI, 1.03-2.86) and all-cause mortality (quartile 4 versus quartile 1: HR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.40-2.78) in multivariate Cox regression model. However, no associations were found between trimethyllysine and nonfatal stroke recurrence or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Trimethyllysine was associated with cardiovascular death independent of trimethylamine N-oxide. Both estimated glomerular filtration rate and hs-CRP (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) had significant mediation effects on the association of trimethyllysine with cardiovascular death, with a mediation effect of 37.8% and 13.4%, respectively. Conclusions Elevated trimethyllysine level is associated with cardiovascular death among patients with ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack. Mediation analyses propose that trimethyllysine contributes to cardiovascular death through inflammation and renal function, suggesting a possible pathomechanistic link.",

         " Oxindole-3-acetic acid is the principal catabolite of indole-3-acetic acid in Zea mays seedlings. In this paper measurements of the turnover of oxindole-3-acetic acid are presented and used to calculate the rate of indole-3-acetic acid oxidation. [3H]Oxindole-3-acetic acid was applied to the endosperm of Zea mays seedlings and allowed to equilibrate for 24 h before the start of the experiment. The subsequent decrease in its specific activity was used to calculate the turnover rate. The average half-life of oxindole-3-acetic acid in the shoots was found to be 30 h while that in the kernels had an average half-life of 35h. Using previously published values of the pool sizes of oxindole-3-acetic acid in shoots and kernels from seedlings of the same age and variety, and grown under the same conditions, the rate of indole-3-acetic acid oxidation was calculated to be 1.1 pmol plant-1 h-1 in the shoots and 7.1 pmol plant-1 h-1 in the kernels. The components contributing to the antioxidative activity of supersweet corn powder (SSCP), which is commonly used in corn soup and snacks in Japan, were clarified and the effects investigated. 7-(O-β-Glucosyloxy)oxindole-3-acetic acid (GOA) was found to be the component most strongly contributing to the 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical-scavenging activity of the 80% ethanol extract of SSCP, and the presence of its aglycone, 7-hydroxy-oxindole-3-acetic acid (HOA) was confirmed. GOA and HOA respectively contributed 35.1% and 10.5% to the DPPH radical-scavenging activity of the 80% ethanol extract of SSCP. Mice orally administered with HOA at doses of both 500 and 1500 mg/kg showed a significantly lower (p<0.05) level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) in the plasma than the vehicle-treated control. These results suggest that GOA and HOA were at least partly involved in the antioxidative activity of SSCP in vitro and that HOA might have possessed antioxidative activity in vivo. A prior study (13) from this laboratory showed that oxidation of exogenously applied indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) to oxindole-3-acetic acid (OxIAA) is the major catabolic pathway for IAA in Zea mays endosperm. In this work, we demonstrate that OxIAA is a naturally occurring compound in shoot and endosperm tissue of Z. mays and that the amount of OxIAA in both shoot and endosperm tissue is approximately the same as the amount of free IAA. Oxindole-3-acetic acid has been reported to be inactive in growth promotion, and thus the rate of oxidation of IAA to OxIAA could be a determinant of IAA levels in Z. mays seedlings and could play a role in the regulation of IAA-mediated growth.",

         "Spermine is a polyamine involved in cellular metabolism that is found in all eukaryotic cells. The precursor for synthesis of spermine is the amino acid ornithine. It is an essential growth factor in some bacteria as well. It is found as a polycation at physiological pH. Spermine is associated with nucleic acids and is thought to stabilize helical structure, particularly in viruses. It functions as an intracellular free radical scavenger to protect DNA from free radical attack. Spermine is the chemical primarily responsible for the characteristic odor of semen. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek first described crystals of spermine phosphate in human semen in 1678. The name spermin was first used by the German chemists Ladenburg and Abel in 1888, and the correct structure of spermine was not finally established until 1926, simultaneously in England (by Dudley, Rosenheim, and Starling) and Germany (by Wrede et al.). == Derivative == A derivative of spermine, N1, N12-bis(ethyl)spermine (also known as BESm) was investigated in the late 1980s along with similar polyamine analogues for its potential as a cancer therapy. == Biosynthesis == Spermine biosynthesis in animals starts with decarboxylation of ornithine by the enzyme Ornithine decarboxylase in the presence of PLP. This decarboxylation gives putrescine. Thereafter the enzyme spermidine synthase effects two N-alkylation by decarboxy-S-adenosyl methionine. The intermediate is spermidine. Plants employ additional routes to spermine. In one pathway L-glutamine is the precursor to L-ornithine, after which the synthesis of spermine from L-ornithine follows the same pathway as in animals. Another pathway in plants starts with decarboxylation of L-arginine to produce agmatine. The imine functional group in agmatine then is hydrolysed by agmatine deiminase, releasing ammonia, converting the guanidine group into a urea. The resulting N-carbamoylputrescine is acted on by a hydrolase to split off the urea group, leaving putrescine. After that the putrescine follows the same pathway to completing the synthesis of spermine. == References == == Further reading == Slocum, R. D., Flores, H.

         " Of interest is if factors like maternal diet can influence the risk of hypospadias-affected pregnancy. Increased propionylcarnitine (C3) is regarded as a biomarker of vitamin B12 deficiency. The retrospective study was undertaken to determine whether increased propionylcarnitine and low methionine in newborns are associated with hypospadias. 41 newborns with hypospadias and 90 control newborns without congenital anomalies were investigated. Whole blood propionylcarnitine and methionine concentrations were measured using tandem mass spectrometry. The mean concentration of propionylcarnitine was higher in newborns with hypospadias compared with newborns without congenital anomalies (p = 0.026). The mean methionine level in cases was insignificantly lower than in controls. There appears to be an association between decreased vitamin B12, as indexed by an increase of propionylcarnitine, and hypospadias in the investigated group of patients. The genetic and environmental determinants of serum propionylcarnitine concentrations (PC) remain largely unexplored. This study investigated the impact of genetic and environmental factors on serum propionylcarnitine levels in middle-aged and elderly participants from the Ansan/Ansung cohort of the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study. Our goal was to understand the role of PC on the risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS) leading to cardiovascular disease, particularly concerning branched-chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism. We analyzed participants' demographic, lifestyle, and biochemical data with and without MetS. Serum metabolite concentrations, including carnitine, acylcarnitine, and amino acid concentrations, were measured, and the components of MetS were evaluated. Genetic variants associated with low and high PC were selected using genome-wide association studies after adjusting for MetS-related parameters. Further, genetic variants and lifestyle factors that interacted with the polygenic risk score (PRS) were analyzed. Participants with MetS were older and less educated, and their alcohol intake was higher than non-MetS participants. PC was significantly associated with the MetS risk and increased the serum levels of BCAAs and other amino acids. Higher PC positively correlated with MetS components, insulin resistance, and cardiovascular risk factors. Intake of calcium, sodium, and vitamin D were inversely associated with PC, but coffee consumption was positively linked to PC. Multiple C2 And Transmembrane Domain Containing-1 ( Orofacial clefts are thought to be determined by the interplay of genetic and environmental factors. Experiments on animals demonstrated that vitamin B12 supplemented diets antagonize selected teratogens during palatogenesis. Increased propionylcarnitine in neonates is regarded as a marker of maternal vitamin B12 deficiency. The retrospective study was undertaken to determine whether increased propionylcarnitine in newborns is associated with orofacial clefts. Fifty-two newborns with isolated cleft lip with or without cleft palate (CLP) and 107 control newborns without congenital anomalies were investigated. Whole blood propionylcarnitine concentrations were measured using tandem mass spectrometry. The mean concentrations of propionylcarnitine in newborns with clefts and controls were 2.82±1.06µmolL(-1) and 2.68±0.94µmolL(-1), respectively. T-test for equality of means did not confirm any significant differences between both groups (P=0.381). Deficiency of vitamin B12 with metabolic disturbances seems not to be a risk factor for CLP in the investigated group of patients.",

         "Phenylalanine (symbol Phe or F) is an essential α-amino acid with the formula C9H11NO2. It can be viewed as a benzyl group substituted for the methyl group of alanine, or a phenyl group in place of a terminal hydrogen of alanine. This essential amino acid is classified as neutral, and nonpolar because of the inert and hydrophobic nature of the benzyl side chain. The L-isomer is used to biochemically form proteins coded for by DNA. Phenylalanine is a precursor for tyrosine, the monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline), and the biological pigment melanin. It is encoded by the messenger RNA codons UUU and UUC. Phenylalanine is found naturally in the milk of mammals. It is used in the manufacture of food and drink products and sold as a nutritional supplement as it is a direct precursor to the neuromodulator phenethylamine. As an essential amino acid, phenylalanine is not synthesized de novo in humans and other animals, who must ingest phenylalanine or phenylalanine-containing proteins. The one-letter symbol F was assigned to phenylalanine for its phonetic similarity. == History == The first description of phenylalanine was made in 1879, when Schulze and Barbieri identified a compound with the empirical formula, C9H11NO2, in yellow lupine (Lupinus luteus) seedlings. In 1882, Erlenmeyer and Lipp first synthesized phenylalanine from phenylacetaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, and ammonia. The genetic codon for phenylalanine was first discovered by J. Heinrich Matthaei and Marshall W. Nirenberg in 1961. They showed that by using mRNA to insert multiple uracil repeats into the genome of the bacterium E. coli, they could cause the bacterium to produce a polypeptide consisting solely of repeated phenylalanine amino acids. This discovery helped to establish the nature of the coding relationship that links information stored in genomic nucleic acid with protein expression in the living cell. == Dietary sources == Good sources of phenylalanine are eggs, chicken, liver, beef, milk, and soybeans. Another common source of phenylalanine is anything sweetened with the artificial sweetener aspartame, such as diet drinks, diet foods and medication; the metabolism of aspartame produces phenylalanine as one of the compound's metabolites. == Dietary recommendations == The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the U.S. Institute of Medicine set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for essential amino acids in 2002. For phenylalanine plus tyrosine, for adults 19 years and older, 33 mg/kg body weight/day. In 2005 the DRI is set to 27 mg/kg per day (with no tyrosine), the FAO/WHO/UNU recommendation of 2007 is 25 mg/kg per day (with no tyrosine). == Other biological roles == L-Phenylalanine is biologically converted into L-tyrosine, another one of the DNA-encoded amino acids. L-tyrosine in turn is converted into L-DOPA, which is further converted into dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline). The latter three are known as the catecholamines. Phenylalanine uses the same active transport channel as tryptophan to cross the blood–brain barrier. In excessive quantities, supplementation can interfere with the production of serotonin and other aromatic amino acids as well as nitric oxide due to the overuse (eventually, limited availability) of the associated cofactors, iron or tetrahydrobiopterin. The corresponding enzymes for those compounds are the aromatic amino acid hydroxylase family and nitric oxide synthase. === In plants === Phenylalanine is the starting compound used in the synthesis of flavonoids. Lignan is derived from phenylalanine and from tyrosine. Phenylalanine is converted to cinnamic acid by the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia-lyase. == Biosynthesis == Phenylalanine is biosynthesized via the shikimate pathway. == Phenylketonuria == The genetic disorder phenylketonuria (PKU) is the inability to metabolize phenylalanine because of a lack of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Individuals with this disorder are known as \"phenylketonurics\" and must regulate their intake of phenylalanine. Phenylketonurics often use blood tests to monitor the amount of phenylalanine in their blood. Lab results may report phenylalanine levels using either mg/dL and μmol/L. One mg/dL of phenylalanine is approximately equivalent to 60 μmol/L. A (rare) \"variant form\" of phenylketonuria called hyperphenylalaninemia is caused by the inability to synthesize a cofactor called tetrahydrobiopterin, which can be supplemented. Pregnant women with hyperphenylalaninemia may show similar symptoms of the disorder (high levels of phenylalanine in blood), but these indicators will usually disappear at the end of gestation. Pregnant women with PKU must control their blood phenylalanine levels even if the fetus is heterozygous for the defective gene because the fetus could be adversely affected due to hepatic immaturity. A non-food source of phenylalanine is the artificial sweetener aspartame. This compound is metabolized by the body into several chemical byproducts including phenylalanine. The breakdown problems phenylketonurics have with the buildup of phenylalanine in the body also occurs with the ingestion of aspartame, although to a lesser degree. Accordingly, all products in Australia, the U.S. and Canada that contain aspartame must be labeled: \"Phenylketonurics: Contains phenylalanine.\" In the UK, foods containing aspartame must carry ingredient panels that refer to the presence of \"aspartame or E951\" and they must be labeled with a warning \"Contains a source of phenylalanine.\" In Brazil, the label \"Contém Fenilalanina\" (Portuguese for \"Contains Phenylalanine\") is also mandatory in products which contain it. These warnings are placed to help individuals avoid such foods. == D-, L- and DL-phenylalanine == The stereoisomer D-phenylalanine (DPA) can be produced by conventional organic synthesis, either as a single enantiomer or as a component of the racemic mixture. It does not participate in protein biosynthesis although it is found in proteins in small amounts - particularly aged proteins and food proteins that have been processed. The biological functions of D-amino acids remain unclear, although D-phenylalanine has pharmacological activity at niacin receptor 2. DL-Phenylalanine (DLPA) is marketed as a nutritional supplement for its purported analgesic and antidepressant activities, which have been supported by clinical trials. DL-Phenylalanine is a mixture of D-phenylalanine and L-phenylalanine. The reputed analgesic activity of DL-phenylalanine may be explained by the possible blockage by D-phenylalanine of enkephalin degradation by the enzyme carboxypeptidase A. Enkephalins act as agonists of the mu and delta opioid receptors, and agonists of these receptors are known to produce antidepressant effects. The mechanism of DL-phenylalanine's supposed antidepressant activity may also be accounted for in part by the precursor role of L-phenylalanine in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine, though clinical trials have not found an antidepressant effect from L-phenylalanine alone. Elevated brain levels of norepinephrine and dopamine are thought to have an antidepressant effect. D-Phenylalanine is absorbed from the small intestine and transported to the liver via the portal circulation. A small amount of D-phenylalanine appears to be converted to L-phenylalanine. D-Phenylalanine is distributed to the various tissues of the body via the systemic circulation. It appears to cross the blood–brain barrier less efficiently than L-phenylalanine, and so a small amount of an ingested dose of D-phenylalanine is excreted in the urine without penetrating the central nervous system. L-Phenylalanine is an antagonist at α2δ Ca2+ calcium channels with a Ki of 980 nM. In the brain, L-phenylalanine is a competitive antagonist at the glycine binding site of NMDA receptor and at the glutamate binding site of AMPA receptor. At the glycine binding site of NMDA receptor L-phenylalanine has an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (KB) of 573 μM estimated by Schild regression which is considerably lower than brain L-phenylalanine concentration observed in untreated human phenylketonuria. L-Phenylalanine also inhibits neurotransmitter release at glutamatergic synapses in hippocampus and cortex with IC50 of 980 μM, a brain concentration seen in classical phenylketonuria, whereas D-phenylalanine has a significantly smaller effect. == Commercial synthesis == L-Phenylalanine is produced for medical, feed, and nutritional applications, such as aspartame, in large quantities by utilizing the bacterium Escherichia coli, which naturally produces aromatic amino acids like phenylalanine. The quantity of L-phenylalanine produced commercially has been increased by genetically engineering E. coli, such as by altering the regulatory promoters or amplifying the number of genes controlling enzymes responsible for the synthesis of the amino acid. == Derivatives == Boronophenylalanine (BPA) is a dihydroxyboryl derivative of phenylalanine, used in neutron capture therapy. 4-Azido-L-phenylalanine is a protein-incorporated unnatural amino acid used as a tool for bioconjugation in the field of chemical biology. == See also == Phenylalaninol == References == == External links == Phenylalanine mass spectrum Phenylalanine at ChemSynthesis",

         "Lactose, or milk sugar, is a disaccharide composed of galactose and glucose and has the molecular formula C12H22O11. Lactose makes up around 2–8% of milk (by mass). The name comes from lact (gen. lactis), the Latin word for milk, plus the suffix -ose used to name sugars. The compound is a white, water-soluble, non-hygroscopic solid with a mildly sweet taste. It is used in the food industry. == Structure and reactions == Lactose is a disaccharide composed of galactose and glucose, which form a β-1→4 glycosidic linkage. Its systematic name is β-D-galactopyranosyl-(1→4)-D-glucose. The glucose can be in either the α-pyranose form or the β-pyranose form, whereas the galactose can have only the β-pyranose form: hence α-lactose and β-lactose refer to the anomeric form of the glucopyranose ring alone. Detection reactions for lactose are the Wöhlk- and Fearon's test. They can be used to detect the different lactose content of dairy products such as whole milk, lactose free milk, yogurt, buttermilk, coffee creamer, sour cream, kefir, etc. Lactose is hydrolysed to glucose and galactose, isomerised in alkaline solution to lactulose, and catalytically hydrogenated to the corresponding polyhydric alcohol, lactitol. Lactulose is a commercial product, used for treatment of constipation. == Occurrence and isolation == Lactose comprises about 2–8% of milk by weight. Several million tons are produced annually as a by-product of the dairy industry. Whey or milk plasma is the liquid remaining after milk is curdled and strained, for example in the production of cheese. Whey is made up of 6.5% solids, of which 4.8% is lactose, which is purified by crystallisation. Industrially, lactose is produced from whey permeate – whey filtrated for all major proteins. The protein fraction is used in infant nutrition and sports nutrition while the permeate can be evaporated to 60–65% solids and crystallized while cooling. Lactose can also be isolated by dilution of whey with ethanol. == Metabolism == Infant mammals nurse on their mothers to drink milk, which is rich in lactose. The intestinal villi secrete the enzyme lactase (β-D-galactosidase) to digest it. This enzyme cleaves the lactose molecule into its two subunits, the simple sugars glucose and galactose, which can be absorbed. Since lactose occurs mostly in milk, in most mammals, the production of lactase gradually decreases with maturity due to weaning; the removal of lactose from the diet removes the metabolic pressure to continue to produce lactase for its digestion. Many people with ancestry in Europe, West Asia, South Asia, the Sahel belt in West Africa, East Africa and a few other parts of Central Africa maintain lactase production into adulthood due to selection for genes that continue lactase production. In many of these areas, milk from mammals such as cattle, goats, and sheep is used as a large source of food. It was in these regions that genes for lifelong lactase production first evolved. The genes of adult lactose tolerance have evolved independently in various ethnic groups. By descent, more than 70% of western Europeans can digest lactose as adults, compared with less than 30% of people from areas of Africa, eastern and south-eastern Asia and Oceania. In people who are lactose intolerant, lactose is not broken down and provides food for gas-producing gut flora, which can lead to diarrhea, bloating, flatulence, and other gastrointestinal symptoms. == Biological properties == The sweetness of lactose is 0.2 to 0.4, relative to 1.0 for sucrose. For comparison, the sweetness of glucose is 0.6 to 0.7, of fructose is 1.3, of galactose is 0.5 to 0.7, of maltose is 0.4 to 0.5, of sorbose is 0.4, and of xylose is 0.6 to 0.7. When lactose is completely digested in the small intestine, its caloric value is 4 kcal/g, or the same as that of other carbohydrates. However, lactose is not always fully digested in the small intestine. Depending on ingested dose, combination with meals (either solid or liquid), and lactase activity in the intestines, the caloric value of lactose ranges from 2 to 4 kcal/g. Undigested lactose acts as dietary fiber. It also has positive effects on absorption of minerals, such as calcium and magnesium. The glycemic index of lactose is 46 to 65. For comparison, the glycemic index of glucose is 100 to 138, of sucrose is 68 to 92, of maltose is 105, and of fructose is 19 to 27. Lactose has relatively low cariogenicity among sugars. This is because it is not a substrate for dental plaque formation and it is not rapidly fermented by oral bacteria. The buffering capacity of milk also reduces the cariogenicity of lactose. == Applications == Its mild flavor and easy handling properties have led to its use as a carrier and stabiliser of aromas and pharmaceutical products. Lactose is not commonly added directly to food, because its low solubility can lead to a gritty mouthfeel. Infant formula is a notable exception, where lactose is added to match the composition of human milk. However, lactose-reduced formulas are increasing in popularity. One of the undesirable properties of lactose utilization is its low solubility, which can result in crystallization, giving a gritty and sandy mouthfeel in the final product. Usually, in supersaturated solution, sugars tend to crystallize, also forming big agglomerates, depending on the process condition. Lactose is not fermented by most yeast during brewing, which may be used to advantage. For example, lactose may be used to sweeten stout beer; the resulting beer is usually called a milk stout or a cream stout. Yeast belonging to the genus Kluyveromyces have a unique industrial application, as they are capable of fermenting lactose for ethanol production. Surplus lactose from the whey by-product of dairy operations is a potential source of alternative energy. Another significant lactose use is in the pharmaceutical industry. Lactose is added to tablet and capsule drug products as an ingredient because of its physical and functional properties (examples are atorvastatin, levocetirizine or thiamazole among many others). For similar reasons, it can be used to dilute illicit drugs such as cocaine or heroin. == History == The first crude isolation of lactose, by Italian physician Fabrizio Bartoletti (1576–1630), was published in 1633. In 1700, the Venetian pharmacist Lodovico Testi (1640–1707) published a booklet of testimonials to the power of milk sugar (saccharum lactis) to relieve, among other ailments, the symptoms of arthritis. In 1715, Testi's procedure for making milk sugar was published by Antonio Vallisneri. Lactose was identified as a sugar in 1780 by Carl Wilhelm Scheele. In 1812, Heinrich Vogel (1778–1867) recognized that glucose was a product of hydrolyzing lactose. In 1856, Louis Pasteur crystallized the other component of lactose, galactose. By 1894, Emil Fischer had established the configurations of the component sugars. Lactose was named by the French chemist Jean Baptiste André Dumas (1800–1884) in 1843. In 1856, Pasteur named galactose \"lactose\". In 1860, Marcellin Berthelot renamed it \"galactose\", and transferred the name \"lactose\" to what is now called lactose. It has a formula of C12H22O11 and the hydrate formula C12H22O11·H2O, making it an isomer of sucrose. == See also == Lac operon Lactic acid Lactose intolerance Nectar Sugars in wine == References == == External links == Media related to Lactose at Wikimedia Commons",

It is also one of the binding targets of C-reactive protein (CRP). Thus, when a cell is damaged, CRP binds to phosphocholine, beginning the recognition and phagocytotic immunologic response. Phosphocholine is a natural constituent of hens' eggs (and many other eggs) often used in biomimetic membrane studies. == See also == Alkylphosphocholines Choline Phosphoethanolamine == References == == External links == Phosphocholine 3D Structure Viewer",

         " Adenosine is an endogenous nucleoside that modulates a number of physiologic functions in the central nervous system (CNS) and in peripheral organs, such as the heart, kidney, and muscle (1, 2). The effect is mediated by two major subtypes of receptors (A 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) exacerbates mitochondrial impairment and α-synuclein expression leading to Parkinsonism. Impaired mitochondria and over-expressed α-synuclein are degraded and eliminated via macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy. Owing to multiple properties, silymarin protects from oxidative stress-mediated cellular injury. However, its effect on MPTP-induced changes in autophagy is not yet known. The study aimed to decipher the effect of silymarin on MPTP-induced changes in autophagy. Male mice (20-25 g) were treated with silymarin (intraperitoneally, daily, 40 mg/kg) for 2 weeks. On day 7, a few animals were also administered with MPTP (intraperitoneally, 20 mg/kg, 4 injections at 2-h interval) along with vehicles. Striatal dopamine content was determined. Western blot analysis was done to assess α-synuclein, beclin-1, sequestosome, phosphorylated 5' adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK), lysosome-associated membrane protein-2 (LAMP-2), heat shock cognate-70 (Hsc-70), LAMP-2A, phosphorylated unc-51-like autophagy activating kinase (p-Ulk1), and phosphorylated mechanistic target of rapamycin (p-mTOR) levels in the nigrostriatal tissue. Silymarin rescued from MPTP-induced increase in beclin-1, sequestosome, p-AMPK, and p-Ulk1 and decrease in LAMP-2, p-mTOR, and LAMP-2A levels. Silymarin defended against MPTP-induced increase in α-synuclein and reduction in dopamine content. The results demonstrate that silymarin protects against MPTP-induced changes in autophagy leading to Parkinsonism. The catalytic mechanism of the majority of S-adenosyl methionine (AdoMet)-dependent methyl transferases requires no divalent metal ions. Here we report that methyl transfer from AdoMet to N(1) of G37-tRNA, catalyzed by the bacterial TrmD enzyme, is strongly dependent on divalent metal ions and that Mg(2+) is the most physiologically relevant. Kinetic isotope analysis, metal rescue, and spectroscopic measurements indicate that Mg(2+) is not involved in substrate binding, but in promoting methyl transfer. On the basis of the pH-activity profile indicating one proton transfer during the TrmD reaction, we propose a catalytic mechanism in which the role of Mg(2+) is to help to increase the nucleophilicity of N(1) of G37 and stabilize the negative developing charge on O(6) during attack on the methyl sulfonium of AdoMet. This work demonstrates how Mg(2+) contributes to the catalysis of AdoMet-dependent methyl transfer in one of the most crucial posttranscriptional modifications to tRNA.",

         "Ferulic acid is a hydroxycinnamic acid derivative and a phenolic compound. It is an organic compound with the formula (CH3O)HOC6H3CH=CHCO2H. The name is derived from the genus Ferula, referring to the giant fennel (Ferula communis). Classified as a phenolic phytochemical, ferulic acid is an amber colored solid. Esters of ferulic acid are found in plant cell walls, covalently bonded to hemicellulose such as arabinoxylans. Salts and esters derived from ferulic acid are called ferulates. == Occurrence in nature == Ferulic acid is ubiquitous in the plant kingdom, including a number of vegetable sources. It occurs in particularly high concentrations in popcorn and bamboo shoots. It is a major metabolite of chlorogenic acids in humans along with caffeic and isoferulic acid, and is absorbed in the small intestine, whereas other metabolites such as dihydroferulic acid, feruloylglycine and dihydroferulic acid sulfate are produced from chlorogenic acid in the large intestine by the action of gut flora. In cereals, ferulic acid is localized in the bran – the hard outer layer of grain. In wheat, phenolic compounds are mainly found in the form of insoluble bound ferulic acid and may be relevant to resistance to wheat fungal diseases. The highest known concentration of ferulic acid glucoside has been found in flaxseed (4.1±0.2 g/kg). It is also found in barley grain. Asterid eudicot plants can also produce ferulic acid. The tea brewed from the leaves of yacón (Smallanthus sonchifolius), a plant traditionally grown in the northern and central Andes, contains quantities of ferulic acid. In legumes, the white bean variety navy bean is the richest source of ferulic acid among the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) varieties. It is also found in horse grams (Macrotyloma uniflorum). Although there are many sources of ferulic acid in nature, its bioavailability depends on the form in which it is present: free ferulic acid has limited solubility in water, and hence poor bioavailability. In wheat grain, ferulic acid is found bound to cell wall polysaccharides, allowing it to be released and absorbed in the small intestine. === In processed foods === Cooked sweetcorn releases increased levels of ferulic acid. As plant sterol esters, this compound is naturally found in rice bran oil, a popular cooking oil in several Asian countries. Ferulic acid glucoside can be found in commercial breads containing flaxseed. Rye bread contains ferulic acid dehydrodimers. == Metabolism == === Biosynthesis === Ferulic acid is biosynthesized in plants from caffeic acid by the action of the enzyme caffeate O-methyltransferase. In a proposed ferulic acid biosynthetic pathway for Escherichia coli, L-tyrosine is converted to 4-coumaric acid by tyrosine ammonia lyase, which is converted to caffeic acid by Sam5, which is then converted to ferulic acid by caffeic acid methyltransferase. Ferulic acid, together with dihydroferulic acid, is a component of lignocellulose, serving to crosslink the lignin and polysaccharides, thereby conferring rigidity to the cell walls. It is an intermediate in the synthesis of monolignols, the monomers of lignin, and is also used for the synthesis of lignans. === Biodegradation === Ferulic acid is converted by certain strains of yeast, notably strains used in brewing of wheat beers, such as Saccharomyces delbrueckii (Torulaspora delbrueckii), to 4-vinyl guaiacol (2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol) which gives beers such as Weissbier and Wit their distinctive clove-like flavour. Saccharomyces cerevisiae (dry baker's yeast) and Pseudomonas fluorescens are also able to convert trans-ferulic acid into 2-methoxy-4-vinylphenol. In P. fluorescens, a ferulic acid decarboxylase has been isolated. == Ecology == Ferulic acid is one of the compounds that initiate the vir (virulence) region of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, inducing it to infect plant cells. == Extraction == It can be extracted from wheat bran and maize bran using concentrated alkali. == See also == Caffeic acid Coumaric acid Diferulic acids Eugenol Isoferulic acid, an isomer of ferulic acid == References ==",

         " The management of acquired hypertrichosis (HT) is based on the search of the causes and subsequent specific treatment. However, simultaneous hair removal is important. No single method for hair removal is appropriate for all patients and skin areas. Treatment options are actually limited and clinical results are often unsatisfactory. Ornithine decarboxylase 1 (ODC1), an enzyme present in hair follicles, is considered as a potential target to inhibit hair growth. Only eflornithine hydrochloride, an inhibitor of ODC1, showed to be partially effective in the management of acquired HT. The aim of our study was to evaluate the potential inhibition of ODC1 activity by a cream containing 4% capryloyl glycine, an ODC1 inhibitor, and 1% glycine soy-fermented extract (soy isoflavonoids). Furthermore, we present the results of a placebo-controlled clinical study that evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of this cream. The ODC1 activity was detected by measuring absorbance at 340 nm. In the presence of ODC1 inhibitors, absorbance decreases as a function of inhibition. Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) was provided as an inhibitor control. ODC1 activity inhibition was expressed as percentage of control (untreated sample). All data were presented as mean ± standard deviation of three independent experiments. To determine if statistically significant differences between treatments were present, a t test analysis was performed. The differences between groups were considered significant at p < 0.05. Twelve Caucasian female adult patients, with HT located on the forearms, were enrolled. The study cream (product A) was applied twice/day for four months on the right forearm. A placebo cream (product B) was applied twice/day for four months on the left forearm. Clinical efficacy was evaluated by means of macrophotography. The cream significantly inhibited ODC1 activity (35.1 ± 0.5% inhibition, equivalent to a 64.9 ± 0.5% ODC1 activity). DFMO completely abolished the enzymatic activity (100 ± 5% inhibition, equivalent to 0 ± 5% ODC1 activity). All patients were considered evaluable. In 11 out of 12 patients (91.7%), who were treated with product A, an improvement was observed. No improvement was observed in patients treated with product B. The global assessment showed good efficacy in 7 patients (58.3%) and moderate efficacy in 5 patients (41.7%) treated with the product A. No efficacy was detected in patients treated with product B. The study cream showed to be effective in Caucasian, adult, female patients with hypertrichosis located on the forearms.",

         " Being the fourth most fatal malignancy worldwide, pancreatic cancer is on track to become the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States by 2030. Gemcitabine is a first-line chemotherapeutic agent for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Gemcitabine Elaidate (Gem Elaidate) is a lipophilic derivative which allows hENT1-independent intracellular delivery of gemcitabine and better pharmacokinetics and entrapment in a nanocarrier. Cancer cells and neovasculature are negatively charged compared to healthy cells. Palmitoyl-DL-carnitine chloride (PC) is a Protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor which also provides a cationic surface charge to nanoliposomes for targeting tumor neovasculature and augmented anticancer potency. The objectives of our study are: (a) to develop and characterize a PKC inhibitor-anchored Gem Elaidate-loaded PEGylated nanoliposome (PGPLs) and (b) to investigate the anticancer activity of Gem Elaidate and PGPLs in 2D and 3D models of pancreatic cancer. The optimized PGPLs resulted in a particle size of 80 ± 2.31 nm, a polydispersity index of 0.15 ± 0.05 and a ζ-potential of +31.6 ± 3.54 mV, with a 93.25% encapsulation efficiency of Gem Elaidate in PGPLs. Our results demonstrate higher cellular uptake, inhibition in migration, as well as angiogenesis potential and significant apoptosis induced by PGPLs in 3D multicellular tumor spheroids of pancreatic cancer cells. Hence, PGPLs could be an effective and novel nanoformulation for the neovasculature-specific delivery of Gemcitabine Elaidate to treat PDAC. Disruption of acylcarnitine homeostasis results in life-threatening outcomes in humans. Carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase deficiency (CACTD) is a scarce autosomal recessive genetic disease and may result in patients' death due to heart arrest or respiratory insufficiency. However, the reasons and mechanism of CACTD inducing respiratory insufficiency have never been elucidated. Herein, we employed lipidomic techniques to create comprehensive lipidomic maps of entire lungs throughout both prenatal and postnatal developmental stages in mice. We found that the acylcarnitines manifested notable variations and coordinated the expression levels of carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (Cact) across these lung developmental stages.  Circulating acyl-carnitines (acyl-CNTs) are associated with insulin resistance (IR) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) in both rodents and humans. However, the mechanisms whereby circulating acyl-CNTs are increased in these conditions and their role in whole-body metabolism remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine if, in humans, blood cells contribute in production of circulating acyl-CNTs and associate with whole-body fat metabolism. Eight non-diabetic healthy women (age: 47 ± 19 y; BMI: 26 ± 1 kg·m In women, blood cells contribute to plasma acyl-CNT levels and the acyl-CNT production is linked to plasma palmitate oxidation, a marker of whole-body fat metabolism. Future studies are needed to confirm the role of blood cells in acyl-CNT and lipid metabolism under different physiological (i.e., in response to meal) and pathological (i.e., hyperlipidemia, IR and T2D) conditions.",

         "Trehalose (from Turkish tıgala – a sugar derived from insect cocoons + -ose) is a sugar consisting of two molecules of glucose. It is also known as mycose or tremalose. Some bacteria, fungi, plants and invertebrate animals synthesize it as a source of energy, and to survive freezing and lack of water. Extracting trehalose was once a difficult and costly process, but around 2000, the Hayashibara company (Okayama, Japan) discovered an inexpensive extraction technology from starch. Trehalose has high water retention capabilities, and is used in food, cosmetics and as a drug. A procedure developed in 2017 using trehalose allows sperm storage at room temperatures. == Structure == Trehalose is a disaccharide formed by a 1,1-glycosidic bond between two α-glucose units. It is found in nature as a disaccharide and also as a monomer in some polymers. Two other stereoisomers exist: α,β-trehalose, also called neotrehalose, and β,β-trehalose, also called isotrehalose. Neither of these alternate isomers has been isolated from living organisms, but isotrehalose has been was found in starch hydroisolates. == Synthesis == At least three biological pathways support trehalose biosynthesis. An industrial process can derive trehalose from corn starch. == Properties == === Chemical === Trehalose is a nonreducing sugar formed from two glucose units joined by a 1–1 alpha bond, giving it the name α-D-gluco­pyranosyl-(1→1)-α-D-gluco­pyranoside. The bonding makes trehalose very resistant to acid hydrolysis, and therefore is stable in solution at high temperatures, even under acidic conditions. The bonding keeps nonreducing sugars in closed-ring form, such that the aldehyde or ketone end groups do not bind to the lysine or arginine residues of proteins (a process called glycation). Trehalose is less soluble than sucrose, except at high temperatures (>80 °C). Trehalose forms a rhomboid crystal as the dihydrate, and has 90% of the calorific content of sucrose in that form. Anhydrous forms of trehalose readily regain moisture to form the dihydrate. Anhydrous forms of trehalose can show interesting physical properties when heat-treated. Trehalose aqueous solutions show a concentration-dependent clustering tendency. Owing to their ability to form hydrogen bonds, they self-associate in water to form clusters of various sizes. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations showed that concentrations of 1.5–2.2 molar allow trehalose molecular clusters to percolate and form large and continuous aggregates. Trehalose directly interacts with nucleic acids, facilitates melting of double stranded DNA and stabilizes single-stranded nucleic acids. === Biological === Organisms ranging from bacteria, yeast, fungi, insects, invertebrates, and lower and higher plants have enzymes that can make trehalose. In nature, trehalose can be found in plants, and microorganisms. In animals, trehalose is prevalent in shrimp, and also in insects, including grasshoppers, locusts, butterflies, and bees, in which trehalose serves as blood-sugar. Trehalase genes are found in tardigrades, the microscopic ecdysozoans found worldwide in diverse extreme environments. Trehalose is the major carbohydrate energy storage molecule used by insects for flight. One possible reason for this is that the glycosidic linkage of trehalose, when acted upon by an insect trehalase, releases two molecules of glucose, which is required for the rapid energy requirements of flight. This is double the efficiency of glucose release from the storage polymer starch, for which cleavage of one glycosidic linkage releases only one glucose molecule. The concentrations of both trehalose and glucose in the insect hemolymph are tightly controlled by multiple enzymes and hormones, including trehalase, insulin-like peptides (ILPs and DILPs), adipokinetic hormone (AKH), leucokinin (LK), octopamine and other mediators, thereby maintaining carbohydrate homeostasis by endocrine and metabolic feedback mechanisms. In plants, trehalose is seen in sunflower seeds, moonwort, Selaginella plants, and sea algae. Within the fungi, it is prevalent in some mushrooms, such as shiitake (Lentinula edodes), oyster, king oyster, and golden needle. Even within the plant kingdom, Selaginella (sometimes called the resurrection plant), which grows in desert and mountainous areas, may be cracked and dried out, but will turn green again and revive after rain because of the function of trehalose. The two prevalent theories as to how trehalose works within the organism in the state of cryptobiosis are the vitrification theory, a state that prevents ice formation, or the water displacement theory, whereby water is replaced by trehalose. In bacterial cell wall, trehalose has a structural role in adaptive responses to stress such as osmotic differences and extreme temperature. Yeast uses trehalose as a carbon source in response to abiotic stresses. In humans, the only known function of trehalose is as a neuroprotective, which it accomplishes by inducing autophagy and thereby clearing protein aggregates. Trehalose has also been reported for anti-bacterial, anti-biofilm, and anti-inflammatory (in vitro and in vivo) activities, upon its esterification with fatty acids of varying chain lengths. == Nutritional and dietary properties == Trehalose is rapidly broken down into glucose by the enzyme trehalase, which is present in the brush border of the intestinal mucosa of omnivores (including humans) and herbivores.: 135 It causes less of a spike in blood sugar than glucose. Trehalose has about 45% the sweetness of sucrose at concentrations above 22%, but when the concentration is reduced, its sweetness decreases more quickly than that of sucrose, so that a 2.3% solution tastes 6.5 times less sweet as the equivalent sugar solution.: 444 It is commonly used in prepared frozen foods, like ice cream, because it lowers the freezing point of foods. Deficiency of trehalase enzyme is unusual in humans, except in the Greenlandic Inuit, where it is present in only 10–15% of the population.: 197 == Metabolism == Five biosynthesis pathways have been reported for trehalose. The most common pathway is TPS/TPP pathway which is used by organisms that synthesize trehalose using the enzyme trehalose-6-phosphate (T6P) synthase (TPS). Second, trehalose synthase (TS) in certain types of bacteria could produce trehalose by using maltose and another disaccharide with two glucose units as substrates. Third, the TreY-TreZ pathway in some bacteria converts starch that contain maltooligosaccharide or glycogen directly into trehalose. Fourth, in primitive bacteria, trehalose glycisyltransferring synthase (TreT) produces trehalose from ADP-glucose and glucose. Fifth, trehalose phosphorylase (TreP) either hydrolyses trehalose into glucose-1-phosphate and glucose or may act reversibly in certain species. Vertebrates do not have the ability to synthesize or store trehalose. Trehalase in humans is found only in specific location such as the intestinal mucosa, renal brush-border, liver and blood. Expression of this enzyme in vertebrates is initially found during the gestation period that is the highest after weaning. Then, the level of trehalase remained constant in the intestine throughout life. Meanwhile, diets consisting of plants and fungi contain trehalose. Moderate amount of trehalose in diet is essential and having low amount of trehalose could result in diarrhea, or other intestinal symptoms. == Medical use == Trehalose is an ingredient, along with hyaluronic acid, in an artificial tears product used to treat dry eye. Outbreaks of Clostridioides difficile were initially associated with trehalose, but this finding was disputed in 2019. In 2021, the FDA accepted an Investigational New Drug (IND) application and granted fast track status for an injectable form of trehalose (SLS-005) as a potential treatment for spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3). == History == In 1832, H.A.L. Wiggers discovered trehalose in an ergot of rye, and in 1859 Marcellin Berthelot isolated it from Trehala manna, a substance made by weevils and named it trehalose. Trehalose has long been known as an autophagy inducer that acts independently of mTOR. In 2017, research was published showing that trehalose induces autophagy by activating TFEB, a protein that acts as a master regulator of the autophagy-lysosome pathway. == See also == Biostasis Cryoprotectant Cryptobiosis Freeze drying Lentztrehalose Trehalosamine IMCTA-C14 == References == == External links == Media related to Trehalose at Wikimedia Commons Trehalose in sperm preservation",

         " N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD) is a type of p-phenylenediamine (PPD), which is widely used in the manufacture of rubber tires owing to its excellent antiozonant properties. In this study, the developmental cardiotoxicity of 6PPD was evaluated in zebrafish larvae, and the LC50 was approximately 737 μg/L for the larvae at 96 h post fertilization (hpf). In the 6PPD treatment of 100 μg/L, the accumulation concentrations of 6PPD were up to 2658 ng/g in zebrafish larvae, and 6PPD induced significant oxidative stress and cell apoptosis in the early developmental stages of zebrafish. Transcriptome analysis showed that 6PPD exposure could potentially cause cardiotoxicity in larval zebrafish by affecting the transcription of the genes related to the calcium signal pathway and cardiac muscle contraction. The genes related to calcium signaling pathway (slc8a2b, cacna1ab, cacna1da, and pln) were verified by qRT-PCR, which were significantly downregulated in larval zebrafish after exposing to 100 μg/L of 6PPD. Simultaneously, the mRNA levels of the genes related to cardiac functions (myl7, sox9, bmp10, and myh71) also respond accordingly. H&E staining and heart morphology investigation indicated that cardiac malformation occurred in zebrafish larvae exposed to 100 μg/L of 6PPD. Furthermore, the phenotypic observation of transgenic Tg (myl7: EGFP) zebrafish also confirmed that 100 μg/L of 6PPD exposure could change the distance of atria and ventricles of the heart and inhibit some key genes (cacnb3a, ATP2a1l, ryr1b) related to cardiac function in larval zebrafish. These results revealed the toxic effects of 6PPD on the cardiac system of zebrafish larvae. N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD) is used as a ubiquitous rubber antioxidant worldwide and has been shown to be potentially toxic to aquatic organisms. In this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to 6PPD for five days starting at two hours post-fertilization at concentrations of 0, 0.0022, 0.022, and 0.22 mg/L to investigate its effects on embryonic development, the growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor (GH/IGF) axis, and the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis. The results showed that the 96 h LC50 of 6PPD was 2.2 mg/L. 6PPD exposure decreased hatchability, lowered autonomous movement, reduced body length in zebrafish embryos and caused deformities. The hormones levels and the expression of genes related to GH/IGF and HPT axis were altered after exposure to 6PPD in zebrafish larvae. These results indicated that the GH/IGF and HPT axis was disturbed. Moreover, treatment of 6PPD produced oxidative stress in zebrafish embryos. Overall, the present study thus demonstrated that exposure to 0.22 mg/L 6PPD caused developmental toxicity and disrupted the GH/IGF and HPT axis of zebrafish, which could be responsible for developmental impairment and growth inhibition. With increasing concerns about N-(1,3-Dimethylbutyl)-N'-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD) and 6PPD-quinone (6PPD-Q), relevant environmental investigations and toxicological research have sprung up in recent years. However, limited information could be found for human body burden assessment. This work collected and analyzed 200 samples consisting of paired urine and plasma samples from participants (50 male and 50 female) in Tianjin, China. Low detection frequencies (DF, <15 %) were found except for urinary 6PPD-Q (86 %), which suggested the poor residue tendency of 6PPD and 6PPD-Q in blood. The low DFs also lead to no substantial association between two chemicals. Data analysis based on urinary 6PPD-Q showed a significant difference between males and females (p < 0.05). No significant correlation was found for other demographic factors (Body Mass Index (BMI), age, drinking, and smoking). The mean values of daily excretion (ng/kg bw/day) calculated using urinary 6PPD-Q for females and males were 7.381 ng/kg bw/day (female) and 3.360 ng/kg bw/day (male), and apparently female suffered higher daily exposure. Further analysis with daily excretion and ALT (alanine aminotransferase)/TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone)/ blood cell analysis indicators found a potential correlation with 6PPD-Q daily excretion and liver/immune functions. Considering this preliminary assessment, systematic research targeting the potential organs at relevant concentrations is required.",

N-Acetyl-DL-tryptophan and the internal standard, N-formyl-DL-tryptophan, were separated by liquid chromatography on a reversed-phase column with UV detection at 280 nm. Deproteinization and extraction were carried out with methanol. The extraction recovery at the level of 4.9 mM was 92.5 +/- 2.5% (S.D.) (n = 10), and the average coefficient of variation (C.V.) for replicate analyses of albumin solutions (mean = 2.57, 10.44 and 17.10 mM) was 1.10% (n = 27). Octanoic acid was determined gas chromatographically as its methyl ester, with nonanoic acid as the internal standard. The sample pretreatment included acidification, extraction with hexane and derivatization with methanol-sulphuric acid. The relative recovery from albumin solutions was 89.7 +/- 5.8% (S.D.) (n = 6), and replicate determinations of the compound yielded a C.V. of 5.5% (mean = 14.82 mM, n = 9). Methods were developed for the determination of octanoic acid and N-acetyl-DL-tryptophan, which are used as stabilizers in the human blood-derived therapeutic products normal serum albumin and plasma protein fraction. The method for octanoic acid uses GC; quantitation is achieved using heptanoic acid as the internal standard. The method for N-acetyl-DL-tryptophan is based on UV spectrophotometry of the acid-soluble fraction remaining after precipitation of the protein (epsilon 280 for N-acetyl-DL-tryptophan, 5250). The coefficient of variation for replicate determinations of octanoic acid averaged 3.9% (range 2.1-5.5%); that of N-acetyl-DL-tryptophan averaged 1.9% (range 0.5-4.0%). Use of these methods for the analysis of 138 lots of commercial products for octanoic acid and 159 lots for N-acetyl-DL-tryptophan showed that the stabilizer contents of 132 and 158 of these lots, respectively, were within 20% of the value indicated on the product label.",

         "Hippuric acid (Gr. hippos, horse, ouron, urine) is a carboxylic acid and organic compound. It is found in urine and is formed from the combination of benzoic acid and glycine. Levels of hippuric acid rise with the consumption of phenolic compounds (such as in fruit juice, tea and wine). The phenols are first converted to benzoic acid, and then to hippuric acid and excreted in urine. Hippuric acid crystallizes in rhombic prisms which are readily soluble in hot water, melt at 187 °C, and decompose at about 240 °C. High concentrations of hippuric acid may also indicate a toluene intoxication; however, scientists have called this correlation into question because there are other variables that affect levels of hippuric acid. When many aromatic compounds such as benzoic acid and toluene are taken internally, they are converted to hippuric acid by reaction with the amino acid, glycine. == Synthesis == A modern synthesis of hippuric acid involves the acylation of glycine with benzoyl chloride (\"Schotten–Baumann reaction\"). == Physiology == Biochemically, hippuric acid is produced from benzoic acid and glycine, which occurs in the liver, intestine, and kidneys. In terms of mechanism, benzoic acid is converted to benzoyl CoA, an acylating agent. Hippuric acid may be formed from the essential amino acid phenylalanine through at least two pathways. Phenylalanine undergoes biotransformation to form an alpha-keto acid, phenylpyruvic acid, which can tautomerize to a reactive enol. The benzylic carbon is reactive which undergoes peroxidation followed by the competing pathways to either react with the alpha carbon subsequently form an dioxetanol intermediate followed by formation of oxalic acid and benzaldehyde, or, peroxidation can react with the carboxyl group to form an alpha-keto-beta-peroxylactone intermediate followed by formation of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and benzaldehyde. Alternatively, under certain conditions, phenylpyruvic acid may undergo a redox mechanism, such as Iron(II) donating an electron, to directly release carbon dioxide, followed by carbon monoxide, for the formation of a stable toluene radical which is resolved by an antioxidant such as ascorbate. In all of the aforementioned cases, benzaldehyde undergoes biotransformation via CYP450 to benzoic acid followed by conjugation to glycine for formation of hippurate which undergoes urinary excretion. Similarly, toluene reacts with CYP450 to form benzaldehyde. Hippuric acid has been reported to be a marker for Parkinson's disease. == Reactions == Hippuric acid is readily hydrolysed by hot caustic alkalis to benzoic acid and glycine. Nitrous acid converts it into benzoyl glycolic acid, C6H5C(=O)OCH2CO2H. Its ethyl ester reacts with hydrazine to form hippuryl hydrazine, C6H5CONHCH2CONHNH2, which was used by Theodor Curtius for the preparation of hydrazoic acid. Hippuric acid has also been used in Erlenmeyer–Plöchl synthesis of phenylalanine and other amino acids, the reaction proceeding via an oxazolone or \"azlactone\" intermediate. == History == Justus von Liebig showed in 1829 that hippuric acid differed from benzoic acid and he named it, and in 1834 he determined its constitution, while in 1853 French chemist Victor Dessaignes (1800–1885) synthesized it by the action of benzoyl chloride on the zinc salt of glycine. It was also formed by heating benzoic anhydride with glycine, and by heating benzamide with monochloroacetic acid. == See also == para-Aminohippuric acid ortho-Iodohippuric acid Methylhippuric acid (three different isomers) == References ==",

         " Glycine betaine (N, N, N-trimethyl amine) is an osmolyte accumulated in cells that is key for cell volume and turgor regulation, is the principal methyl donor in the methionine cycle and is a DNA and proteins stabilizer. In humans, glycine betaine is synthesized from choline and can be obtained from some foods. Glycine betaine (GB) roles are illustrated in chemical, metabolic, agriculture, and clinical medical studies due to its chemical and physiological properties. Several studies have extensively described GB role and accumulation related to specific pathologies, focusing mainly on analyzing its positive and negative role in these pathologies. However, it is necessary to explain the relationship between glycine betaine and different pathologies concerning its role as an antioxidant, ability to methylate DNA, interact with transcription factors and cell receptors, and participate in the control of homocysteine concentration in liver, kidney and brain. This review summarizes the most important findings and integrates GB role in neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, hepatic, and renal diseases. Furthermore, we discuss GB impact on other dysfunctions as inflammation, oxidative stress, and glucose metabolism, to understand their cross-talks and provide reliable data to establish a base for further investigations. The aim of this research work was to explore the possibility of providing multifunctional oral insulin delivery system by conjugating several types of dipeptides on chitosan and trimethyl chitosan to be used as drug carriers. Conjugates of Glycyl-glycine and alanyl-alanine of chitosan and trimethyl chitosan (on primary alcohol group of polymer located on carbon 6) were synthesized and nanoparticles containing insulin were prepared for oral delivery. Preparation conditions of nanoparticles were optimized and their performance to enhance the permeability of insulin as well as cytotoxicity of nanoparticles in Caco-2 cell line was evaluated. To evaluate the efficacy of orally administered nanoparticles, nanoparticles with the most permeability enhancing ability were studied in male Wistar rats as animal model by measuring insulin and glucose Serum levels. Structural study of all the conjugates by infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance confirmed the successful formation of the conjugates with the desirable substitution degree. By optimizing preparation conditions, nanoparticles with expected size (157.3-197.7 nm), Zeta potential (24.35-34.37 mV), polydispersity index (0.365-0.512), entrapment efficiency (70.60-86.52%) and loading capacity (30.92-56.81%), proper morphology and desirable release pattern were obtained. Glycyl-glycine and alanyl-alanine conjugate nanoparticles of trimethyl chitosan showed 2.5-3.3 folds more effective insulin permeability in Caco-2 cell line than their chitosan counterparts. In animal model, oral administration of glycyl-glycine and alanyl-alanine conjugate nanoparticles of trimethyl chitosan demonstrated reasonable increase in Serum insulin level with relative bioavailability of 17.19% and 15.46% for glycyl-glycine and alanyl-alanine conjugate nanoparticles, respectively, and reduction in Serum glucose level compared with trimethyl chitosan nanoparticles (p < 0.05). It seems that glycyl-glycine and alanyl-alanine conjugate nanoparticles of trimethyl chitosan have met the aim of this research work and have been able to orally deliver insulin with more than one mechanism in animal model. Hence, they are promising candidates for further research studies. Endophytes are a rich source for structurally complex chemical scaffolds with interesting biological activities. Endophytes associated with Brugmansia aurea L. (family: Solanaceae), a medicinal plant, have not yet explored for the bioactive metabolites. Hence, Macrophomina phaseolina, a fungal endophyte, was isolated from the roots of the plant. Its methanolic extract was found active against human cancer cell lines with IC A novel di-peptide, serine-glycine-betaine isolated from M. phaseolina induced apoptosis in MIA-Pa-Ca-2 cells. This study confirms that dipeptides like serine-glycine-betaine and tyrosine-betaine might be specific to fungal genera, hence being used for diagnostic purposes.",

         "Inosine is a nucleoside that is formed when hypoxanthine is attached to a ribose ring (also known as a ribofuranose) via a β-N9-glycosidic bond. It was discovered in 1965 in analysis of RNA transferase. Inosine is commonly found in tRNAs and is essential for proper translation of the genetic code in wobble base pairs. Knowledge of inosine metabolism has led to advances in immunotherapy in recent decades. Inosine monophosphate is oxidised by the enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, yielding xanthosine monophosphate, a key precursor in purine metabolism. Mycophenolate mofetil is an anti-metabolite, anti-proliferative drug that acts as an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. It is used in the treatment of a variety of autoimmune diseases including granulomatosis with polyangiitis because the uptake of purine by actively dividing B cells can exceed 8 times that of normal body cells, and, therefore, this set of white cells (which cannot operate purine salvage pathways) is selectively targeted by the purine deficiency resulting from inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMD) inhibition. == Reactions == Adenine is converted to adenosine or inosine monophosphate (IMP), either of which, in turn, is converted into inosine (I), which pairs with adenine (A), cytosine (C), and uracil (U). Purine nucleoside phosphorylase intraconverts inosine and hypoxanthine. Inosine is also an intermediate in a chain of purine nucleotide reactions required for muscle movements. == Clinical significance == Subsequent studies in humans suggest that inosine supplementation has no effect on athletic performance. Animal studies have suggested that inosine has neuroprotective properties. It has been proposed for spinal cord injury and for administration after stroke, because observation suggests that inosine induces axonal rewiring. After ingestion, inosine is metabolized into uric acid, which has been suggested to be a natural antioxidant and peroxynitrite scavenger with potential benefits to patients with multiple sclerosis (MS). Peroxynitrite has been correlated with axon degeneration In 2003, a study was initiated at the University of Pennsylvania MS Center to determine whether raising the levels of uric acid by the administration of inosine would slow the progression of MS. The study was completed in 2006 but the results were not reported to NIH. A subsequent publication hinted at potential benefits but the sample size (16 patients) was too small for a definitive conclusion. In addition, the side effect of the treatment was the development of kidney stones in four of 16 patients. With phase II trials for Parkinson's disease completed, inosine will continue to phase III trials. Earlier trials suggested that patients with the highest serum urate levels had slower progression of Parkinson's symptoms. The trial uses inosine to raise urate levels in those with levels lower than the population mean (6 mg/dL). Alseres Pharmaceuticals (named Boston Life Sciences when patent was granted) patented the use of inosine to treat stroke and was investigating the drug in the MS setting. In the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System, it is classified as an antiviral. == Binding == Inosine is a natural ligand for the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABA A receptor. == Biotechnology == When designing primers for polymerase chain reaction, inosine is useful in that it can pair with any natural base. This allows for design of primers that span a single-nucleotide polymorphism, without the polymorphism disrupting the primer's annealing efficiency. However, inosine pairs preferentially with cytosine (C) and its introduction to RNA, e.g. by the action of ADARs, thereby destabilizes double-stranded RNA by changing AU base-pairs to IU mismatches. == Fitness == Despite lack of clinical evidence that it improves muscle development, inosine remains an ingredient in some fitness supplements. == Feeding stimulant == Inosine has also been found to be an important feed stimulant by itself or in combination with certain amino acids in some species of farmed fish. For example, inosine and inosine 5-monophosphate have been reported as specific feeding stimulants for turbot fry, (Scophthalmus maximus) and Japanese amberjack, (Seriola quinqueradiata). The main problem of using inosine and/or inosine-5-monophosphate as feeding attractants is their high cost. However, their use may be economically justified within larval feeds for marine fish larvae during the early weaning period, since the total quantity of feed consumed is relatively small. == See also == Inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase Inosine pranobex Nucleobase == References == == External links == PDR health study",

         " Depression is a common global mental disorder that seriously harms human physical and mental health. With the development of society, the increase of pressure and the role of various other factors make the incidence of depression increase year by year. However, there is a lack of drugs that have a fast onset, significant effects, and few side effects. Some volatile oils from traditional natural herbal medicines are usually used to relieve depression and calm emotions, such as Lavender essential oil and Acorus tatarinowii essential oil. It was reported that these volatile oils, are easy to enter the brain through the blood-brain barrier and have good antidepressant effects with little toxicity and side effects. In this review, we summarized the classification of depression, and listed the history of using volatile oils to fight depression in some countries. Importantly, we summarized the anti-depressant natural volatile oils and their monomers from herbal medicine, discussed the anti-depressive mechanisms of the volatile oils from natural medicine. The volatile oils of natural medicine and antidepressant drugs were compared and analyzed, and the application of volatile oils was explained from the clinical use and administration routes. This review would be helpful for the development of potential anti-depressant medicine and provide new alternative treatments for depressive disorders. Internal organs fibrosis (IOF) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in most chronic inflammatory diseases, which is responsible for 45% of deaths due to disease. However, there is a paucity of drugs used to treat IOF, making it urgent to find medicine with good efficacy, low toxic side effects and good prognosis. Essential oils (EOs) extracted from natural herbs with a wide range of pharmacological components, multiple therapeutic targets, low toxicity, and broad sources have unique advantages and great potential in the treatment of IOF. In this review, we summarized EOs and their monomeric components with anti-IOF, and found that they work mainly through inhibiting TGF-β-related signaling pathways, modulating inflammatory cytokines, suppressing NF-κB, and anti-oxidative stress. The prognostic improvement of natural EOs on IOF was further discussed, as well as the quality and safety issues in the current development of natural EOs. This review hopes to provide scientific basis and new ideas for the development and application of natural medicine EOs in anti-IOF. The effect of structurally related sesquiterpenoids (E,E)-farnesol and cis-nerolidol on the host-plant selection behaviour of the peach potato aphid Myzus persicae (Sulz.) was evaluated using electrical penetration graph (EPG) technique. No repellent effects of (E,E)-farnesol and (Z)-nerolidol to M. persicae were found but aphid probing activities on (E,E)-farnesol- and cis-nerolidol-treated plants were restrained. During non-phloem phases of probing, neither (E,E)-farnesol nor (Z)-nerolidol affected the cell puncture activity. On (E,E)-farnesol-treated plants, the total duration of phloem phase, the mean duration of individual sustained ingestion periods were significantly lower, and the proportion of phloem salivation was higher than on control plants. On (Z)-nerolidol-treated plants, the occurrence of the first phloem phase was delayed, and the frequency of the phloem phase was lower than on control plants. The freely moving aphids were reluctant to remain on (E,E)-farnesol- and (Z)-nerolidol-treated leaves for at least 24 h after exposure. (E,E)-Farnesol and (Z)-nerolidol show complementary deterrent properties, (E,E)-farnesol showing ingestive and post-ingestive activities and nerolidol showing pre-ingestive, ingestive, and post-ingestive deterrent activities.",

         " Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) is a leading cause of acute lower respiratory infections, imposing a substantial burden on healthcare systems globally. While lipid disorders have been observed in the lungs of infants and young children with RSV pneumonia, the specific characterization of these lipids and their roles in the development and progression of RSV pneumonia remain largely unexplored. To address this tissue, we established a non-targeted high-resolution lipidomics platform using UHPLC-Q-Exactive-MS to analyze lipid profiles in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) obtained from mice infected with RSV. Through the lipidomics analysis, a total of 72 lipids species were identified, with 40 lipids were significantly changed. Notably, the primary changes were observed in ether phospholipids and lysophospholipids. Furthermore, a targeted lipidomics analysis utilizing UHPLC-QQQ-MS/MS was developed to specifically assess the levels of lysophospholipids, including lysophosphocholine 16:0 (LPC 16:0), lysophosphoethanolamine 16:0 (LPE 16:0) and lysophosphoglycerol 16:0 (LPG 16:0), in RSV-infected mice compared to control mice. Animal experiments revealed that LPE 16:0, rather than LPC 16:0 or LPG 16:0, provided protection against RSV-induced weight loss, reduced lung viral load, regulated immune cells and mitigated lung injury in mice afflicted with RSV pneumonia. In summary, our findings suggested that the host responses to RSV infection pathology are closely with various lipid metabolic. Additionally, our results elucidated novel biological functions of LPE 16:0 and offering new avenues for drug development against RSV pneumonia.",

         " We prepared super-hydrophobic nanocellulose films using a non-toxic octadecylamine/polydopamine system. Octadecylamine, a low surface energy material, was used to provide hydrophobic alkyl long chains. Polydopamine was produced by dopamine under alkaline conditions, creating an adhesive substance, which reinforced the hydrophobic long chains and increased the surface roughness of nanocellulose. The effects of reagent concentration, reaction temperature, and reaction time on hydrophobicity were then investigated. The results showed that with a 1:1 mass ratio of nanocellulose to octadecylamine, and reacting at 60 °C for 4 h, the contact angle of the obtained composite membrane reached 168.2°. Scanning electron microscope images revealed that the modified nanocellulose had a smaller particle size and more uniform distribution, which effectively improved the hydrophobicity of the nanocellulose. Thus, the green preparation of superhydrophobic films with high-temperature resistance and wear resistance was realized, which contributed to the high-value utilization of nanocellulose. A kind of heterogeneous catalyst, FeMn layered double hydroxide (Fe-Mn-LDH), was fabricated by coprecipitation process and used as PMS activator to degrade a novel organic pollutant octadecylamine (ODA). And the X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), transmission electron microcopy (TEM), Mapping and X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) measurements were utilized to characterize the fresh and used Fe-Mn-LDH. After a serious of degradation experiments, it was clearly to see that the activator possessed excellent activation property for PMS and was capable of removing 85% ODA (10 mg·L In this research, a dispersive solid phase extraction procedure based on changing the solubility of octadecylamine with pH was proposed to determine Ag",

         "Nortriptyline, sold under the brand name Aventyl, among others, is a tricyclic antidepressant. This medicine is also sometimes used for neuropathic pain, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), smoking cessation and anxiety. Its use for young people with depression and other psychiatric disorders may be limited due to increased suicidality in the 18–24 population initiating treatment. Nortriptyline is not a preferred treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or smoking cessation. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include dry mouth, constipation, blurry vision, sleepiness, low blood pressure with standing, and weakness. Serious side effects may include seizures, an increased risk of suicide in those less than 25 years of age, urinary retention, glaucoma, mania, and a number of heart issues. Nortriptyline may cause problems if taken during pregnancy. Use during breastfeeding appears to be relatively safe. It is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) and is believed to work by altering levels of serotonin and norepinephrine. Nortriptyline was approved for medical use in the United States in 1964. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 191st most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Nortriptyline is used to treat depression. A level between 50 and 150 ng/mL of nortriptyline in the blood generally corresponds with an antidepressant effect. It is also used off-label for the treatment of panic disorder, ADHD, irritable bowel syndrome, tobacco-cessation, migraine prophylaxis and chronic pain or neuralgia modification, particularly temporomandibular joint disorder. === Irritable bowel syndrome === Nortriptyline has also been used as an off-label treatment for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). == Contraindications == Nortriptyline should not be used in the acute recovery phase after myocardial infarction (heart attack). Use of tricyclic antidepressants along with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), linezolid, or IV methylene blue are contraindicated as it can cause an increased risk of developing serotonin syndrome. Closer monitoring is required for those with a history of cardiovascular disease, stroke, glaucoma, or seizures, as well as in persons with hyperthyroidism or receiving thyroid hormones. == Side effects == The most common side effects include dry mouth, sedation, constipation, increased appetite, blurred vision and tinnitus. An occasional side effect is a rapid or irregular heartbeat. Alcohol may exacerbate some of its side effects. == Overdose == The symptoms and the treatment of an overdose are generally the same as for the other tricyclic antidepressants, including anticholinergic effects, serotonin syndrome and adverse cardiac effects. TCAs, particularly nortriptyline, have a relatively narrow therapeutic index, which increase the chance of an overdose (both accidental and intentional). Symptoms of overdose include: irregular heartbeat, seizures, coma, confusion, hallucination, widened pupils, drowsiness, agitation, fever, low body temperature, stiff muscles and vomiting. == Interactions == Excessive consumption of alcohol in combination with nortriptyline therapy may have a potentiating effect, which may lead to the danger of increased suicidal attempts or overdosage, especially in patients with histories of emotional disturbances or suicidal ideation. It may interact with the following drugs: heart rhythm medications such as flecainide (Tambocor), propafenone (Rhythmol), or quinidine (Cardioquin, Quinidex, Quinaglute) cimetidine guanethidine reserpine == Pharmacology == Nortriptyline is a strong norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and a moderate serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Additionally, nortriptyline inhibits the activity of histamine and acetylcholine. Its pharmacologic profile is as the table shows with (inhibition or antagonism of all sites). === Pharmacodynamics === Nortriptyline is an active metabolite of amitriptyline by demethylation in the liver. Chemically, it is a secondary amine dibenzocycloheptene and pharmacologically it is classed as a first-generation antidepressant. Nortriptyline may also have a sleep-improving effect due to antagonism of the H1 and 5-HT2A receptors. In the short term, however, nortriptyline may disturb sleep due to its activating effect. In one study, nortriptyline had the highest affinity for the dopamine transporter among the tricyclic antidepressants (KD = 1,140 nM) besides amineptine (a norepinephrine–dopamine reuptake inhibitor), although its affinity for this transporter was still 261- and 63-fold lower than for the norepinephrine and serotonin transporters (KD = 4.37 and 18 nM, respectively). === Pharmacogenetics === Nortriptyline is metabolized in the liver by the hepatic enzyme CYP2D6, and genetic variations within the gene coding for this enzyme can affect its metabolism, leading to changes in the concentrations of the drug in the body. Increased concentrations of nortriptyline may increase the risk for side effects, including anticholinergic and nervous system adverse effects, while decreased concentrations may reduce the drug's efficacy. Individuals can be categorized into different types of CYP2D6 metabolizers depending on which genetic variations they carry. These metabolizer types include poor, intermediate, extensive, and ultrarapid metabolizers. Most individuals (about 77–92%) are extensive metabolizers, and have \"normal\" metabolism of nortriptyline. Poor and intermediate metabolizers have reduced metabolism of the drug as compared to extensive metabolizers; patients with these metabolizer types may have an increased probability of experiencing side effects. Ultrarapid metabolizers use nortriptyline much faster than extensive metabolizers; patients with this metabolizer type may have a greater chance of experiencing pharmacological failure. The Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium recommends avoiding nortriptyline in persons who are CYP2D6 ultrarapid or poor metabolizers, due to the risk of a lack of efficacy and side effects, respectively. A reduction in starting dose is recommended for patients who are CYP2D6 intermediate metabolizers. If use of nortriptyline is warranted, therapeutic drug monitoring is recommended to guide dose adjustments. The Dutch Pharmacogenetics Working Group recommends reducing the dose of nortriptyline in CYP2D6 poor or intermediate metabolizers, and selecting an alternative drug or increasing the dose in ultrarapid metabolizers. == Chemistry == Nortriptyline is a tricyclic compound, specifically a dibenzocycloheptadiene, and possesses three rings fused together with a side chain attached in its chemical structure. Other dibenzocycloheptadiene tricyclic antidepressants include amitriptyline (N-methylnortriptyline), protriptyline, and butriptyline. Nortriptyline is a secondary amine tricyclic antidepressant, with its N-methylated parent amitriptyline being a tertiary amine. Other secondary amine tricyclic antidepressants include desipramine and protriptyline. The chemical name of nortriptyline is 3-(10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5-ylidene)-N-methyl-1-propanamine and its free base form has a chemical formula of C19H21N1 with a molecular weight of 263.384 g/mol. The drug is used commercially mostly as the hydrochloride salt; the free base form is used rarely. The CAS Registry Number of the free base is 72-69-5 and of the hydrochloride is 894-71-3. == History == Nortriptyline was developed by Geigy. It first appeared in the literature in 1962 and was patented the same year. The drug was first introduced for the treatment of depression in 1963. == Society and culture == === Generic names === Nortriptyline is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name, BANTooltip British Approved Name, and DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française, while nortriptyline hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, USPTooltip United States Pharmacopeia, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. Its generic name in Spanish and Italian and its DCITTooltip Denominazione Comune Italiana are nortriptilina, in German is nortriptylin, and in Latin is nortriptylinum. === Brand names === Brand names of nortriptyline include Allegron, Aventyl, Noritren, Norpress, Nortrilen, Norventyl, Norzepine, Pamelor, and Sensival, among many others. == Research == Although not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for neuropathic pain, randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the effectiveness of tricyclic antidepressants for the treatment of this condition in both depressed and non-depressed individuals. In 2010, an evidence-based guideline sponsored by the International Association for the Study of Pain recommended nortriptyline as a first-line medication for neuropathic pain. However, in a 2015 Cochrane systematic review the authors did not recommend nortriptyline as a first-line agent for neuropathic pain. It may be effective in the treatment of tobacco-cessation. == References ==",

         "Thymidine (symbol dT or dThd), also known as deoxythymidine, deoxyribosylthymine, or thymine deoxyriboside, is a pyrimidine deoxynucleoside. Deoxythymidine is the DNA nucleoside T, which pairs with deoxyadenosine (A) in double-stranded DNA. In cell biology it is used to synchronize the cells in G1/early S phase. The prefix deoxy- is often left out since there are no precursors of thymine nucleotides involved in RNA synthesis. Before the boom in thymidine use caused by the need for thymidine in the production of the antiretroviral drug azidothymidine (AZT), much of the world's thymidine production came from herring sperm. Thymidine occurs almost exclusively in DNA but it also occurs in the T-loop of tRNA. == Structure and properties == In its composition, deoxythymidine is a nucleoside composed of deoxyribose (a pentose sugar) joined to the pyrimidine base thymine. Deoxythymidine can be phosphorylated with one, two or three phosphoric acid groups, creating dTMP (deoxythymidine monophosphate), dTDP, or dTTP (for the di- and tri- phosphates, respectively). It exists in solid form as small white crystals or white crystalline powder. It has a molecular weight of 242.229 Da and a melting point of 185 °C. The stability of deoxythymidine under standard temperature and pressure (STP) is very high. Deoxythymidine is non-toxic and is part of one of the four nucleosides in DNA. It is a naturally occurring compound that exists in all living organisms and DNA viruses. Instead of thymidine, RNA contains uridine (uracil joined to ribose). Uracil is chemically very similar to thymine, which is also known as 5-methyluracil. Since thymine nucleotides are precursors of DNA (but not RNA), the prefix \"deoxy\" is often left out, i.e., deoxythymidine is often just called thymidine. Thymidine is listed as a chemical teratogen. == Modified analogs == Iododeoxyuridine is a radiosensitizer and increases the amount of DNA damage received from ionizing radiation. Azidothymidine (AZT) – used in the treatment of HIV infection. AZT inhibits the process of reverse transcription, a critical step in the viral life cycle. Radiolabeled thymidine (TdR), such as tritiated thymidine (3H-TdR), is commonly used in cell proliferation assays. The thymidine is incorporated into dividing cells and the level of this incorporation, measured using a liquid scintillation counter, is proportional to the amount of cell proliferation. For example, lymphocyte proliferation can be measured this way in lymphoproliferative disorders. Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) is another thymidine analog that is often used for the detection of proliferating cells in living tissues. 5-Ethynyl-2´-deoxyuridine (EdU) is a thymidine analog which is incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells and is used to assay DNA synthesis in cell culture or living tissues. It can be visualized by covalently binding a fluorescent azide using click chemistry, which is less harsh than the conditions used to expose the epitope for BrdU antibodies. Edoxudine is an antiviral drug. Telbivudine (β-L-2′-deoxythymidine, LdT) is the unmodified \"unnatural\" L-enantiomer of thymidine that was used in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. == Thymidine imbalance induces mutation and recombination == During growth of bacteriophage T4, an excess of thymidine availability increases mutation. A deficiency of thymidine during growth also increases mutation. A thymidylate auxotroph of the diploid yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was grown under conditions in which thymidyate levels varied from excess to depletion. High levels of thymidylate were observed to be mutagenic and recombinogenic, whereas starvation for thymidylate was recombinogenic but only slightly mutagenic. == References == == External links == http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1990/11/05/74308/index.htm",

         "Tamoxifen, sold under the brand name Nolvadex among others, is a selective estrogen receptor modulator used to prevent breast cancer in women and men. It is also being studied for other types of cancer. It has been used for Albright syndrome. Tamoxifen is typically taken daily by mouth for five years for breast cancer. Serious side effects include a small increased risk of uterine cancer, stroke, vision problems, and pulmonary embolism. Common side effects include irregular periods, weight loss, and hot flashes. It may cause harm to the baby if taken during pregnancy or breastfeeding. It is a selective estrogen-receptor modulator (SERM) and works by decreasing the growth of breast cancer cells. It is a member of the triphenylethylene group of compounds. Tamoxifen was initially made in 1962, by chemist Dora Richardson. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Tamoxifen is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 317th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 900 thousand prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Dysmenorrhea === Dysmenorrhea is the term for menstrual pain, usually centered in the lower abdomen but often spreading to the back and inner thighs. It is a common gynecological condition that can seriously affect daily activities and well-being. Tamoxifen has been identified and used to effectively improve blood flow, reduce uterine contractility and pain in dysmenorrhea patients. === Breast cancer === Tamoxifen is used for the treatment of both early and advanced estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive or ER+) breast cancer in pre- and postmenopausal women. Tamoxifen increases the risk of postmenopausal bleeding, endometrial polyps, hyperplasia, and endometrial cancer; using tamoxifen with an intrauterine system releasing levonorgestrel might increase vaginal bleeding after 1 to 2 years, but reduces somewhat endometrial polyps and hyperplasia, but not necessarily endometrial cancer. Additionally, it is the most common hormone treatment for male breast cancer. It is also approved by the FDA for the prevention of breast cancer in women at high risk of developing the disease. The effectiveness of tamoxifen is primarily influenced by estrogen receptor (ER) status, which was the key predictor of the proportional benefits observed. It has been further approved for the reduction of contralateral (in the opposite breast) cancer. Five years of adjuvant tamoxifen treatment significantly lowers the 15-year risk of breast cancer recurrence and mortality. The overall use of tamoxifen is recommended for 10 years. In 2006, the large STAR clinical study concluded that raloxifene is also effective in reducing the incidence of breast cancer. Updated results after an average of 6.75 years of follow up found that raloxifene retains 76% of tamoxifen's effectiveness in preventing invasive breast cancer, with 45% fewer uterine cancers and 25% fewer blood clots in women taking raloxifene than in women taking tamoxifen. === Infertility === Tamoxifen is used for ovulation induction to treat infertility in women with anovulatory disorders. It is given at days three to seven of a woman's cycle. Tamoxifen improves fertility in males with infertility by disinhibiting the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis) via ER antagonism and thereby increasing the secretion of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and increasing testicular testosterone production. Some animal studies have suggested tamoxifen could have negative effects on sperm quality and prostatic and gonadal health. === Gynecomastia === Benign enlargement of the male breast, whether asymptomatic or painful, is a common condition thought to result from an increased estrogen/testosterone ratio or from heightened estrogenic or reduced androgenic activity via receptor interactions.Tamoxifen is used to prevent and treat gynecomastia. It is taken as a preventative measure in small doses, or used at the onset of any symptoms such as nipple soreness or sensitivity. Current treatments typically involve pain relief through medication or surgery. However, targeting the underlying estrogenic stimulation may offer a more specific therapeutic approach. In a double-blind crossover study, patients were given either a placebo or tamoxifen (10 mg orally twice daily) for one month, in random order. Seven out of ten patients saw a reduction in gynecomastia size with tamoxifen (P < 0.005), and the overall reduction for the group was statistically significant (P < 0.01). No benefits were observed with the placebo (P > 0.1). Additionally, all four patients with painful gynecomastia experienced relief of their symptoms, and no toxicity was noted. Although the breast size reduction was partial, this suggests that longer treatment may be necessary. Follow-up examinations conducted 9 to 12 months after treatment revealed no significant changes, except in two cases: one tamoxifen responder had a recurrence of breast tenderness after six months, and one non-responder developed increased breast size and new tenderness after ten months. Other medications are taken for similar purposes such as clomifene and aromatase inhibitor drugs; which are used in order to try to avoid the hormone-related adverse effects. Overall, tamoxifen appears to be a safe and effective treatment option for selected cases of gynecomastia. === Early puberty === Tamoxifen is useful in the treatment of peripheral precocious puberty, for instance due to McCune–Albright syndrome, in both girls and boys. It has been found to decrease growth velocity and the rate of bone maturation in girls with precocious puberty, and hence to improve final height in these individuals. === Available forms === Tamoxifen is available as a tablet or oral solution. == Contraindications == Tamoxifen has a number of contraindications, including known hypersensitivity to tamoxifen or other ingredients, individuals taking concomitant coumarin-type anticoagulant therapy, and women with a history of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism). == Side effects == A report in September 2009 from Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality suggests that tamoxifen, raloxifene, and tibolone used to treat breast cancer significantly reduce invasive breast cancer in midlife and older women, but also increase the risk of adverse side effects. === Endometrial cancer === Tamoxifen is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). Even though it is an antagonist in breast tissue it acts as partial agonist on the endometrium and has been linked to endometrial cancer in some women. Therefore, endometrial changes, including cancer, are among tamoxifen's side effects. With time, risk of endometrial cancer may be doubled to quadrupled, which is a reason tamoxifen is typically only used for five years. The American Cancer Society lists tamoxifen as a known carcinogen, stating that it increases the risk of some types of uterine cancer while lowering the risk of breast cancer recurrence. === Cardiovascular and metabolic === Tamoxifen treatment of postmenopausal women is associated with beneficial effects on serum lipid profiles. However, long-term data from clinical trials have failed to demonstrate a cardioprotective effect. For some women, tamoxifen can cause a rapid increase in triglyceride concentration in the blood. In addition, there is an increased risk of thromboembolism especially during and immediately after major surgery or periods of immobility. Use of tamoxifen has been shown to slightly increase risk of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and stroke. === Liver toxicity === Tamoxifen has been associated with a number of cases of hepatotoxicity. Several different varieties of hepatotoxicity have been reported. Tamoxifen can also precipitate non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in obese and overweight women (not in normal weight women) at an average rate of 40% after a year use with 20 mg/day. == Overdose == Acute overdose of tamoxifen has not been reported in humans. In dose-ranging studies, tamoxifen was administered at very high doses in women (e.g., 300 mg/m2) and was found to produce acute neurotoxicity including tremor, hyperreflexia, unsteady gait, and dizziness. These symptoms occurred within three to five days of therapy and disappeared within two to five days of discontinuation of therapy. No indications of permanent neurotoxicity were observed. QT prolongation was also observed with very high doses of tamoxifen. There is no specific antidote for overdose of tamoxifen. Instead, treatment should be based on symptoms. == Interactions == Patients with variant forms of the gene CYP2D6 may not receive full benefit from tamoxifen because of too slow metabolism of the tamoxifen prodrug into its active metabolites. On 18 October 2006, the Subcommittee for Clinical Pharmacology recommended relabeling tamoxifen to include information about this gene in the package insert. Certain CYP2D6 variations in breast cancer patients lead to a worse clinical outcome for tamoxifen treatment. Genotyping therefore has the potential for identification of women who have these CYP2D6 phenotypes and for whom the use of tamoxifen is associated with poor outcomes. Recent research has shown that 7–10% of women with breast cancer may not receive the full medical benefit from taking tamoxifen due to their genetic make-up. DNA Drug Safety Testing can examine DNA variations in the CYP2D6 and other important drug processing pathways. More than 20% of all clinically used medications are metabolized by CYP2D6 and knowing the CYP2D6 status of a person can help the doctor with the future selection of medications. Other molecular biomarkers may also be used to select appropriate patients likely to benefit from tamoxifen. Recent studies suggest that taking the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) antidepressants paroxetine (Paxil), fluoxetine (Prozac), and sertraline (Zoloft) can decrease the effectiveness of tamoxifen, as these drugs compete for the CYP2D6 enzyme which is needed to metabolize tamoxifen into its active forms. A U.S. study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual meeting in 2009 found that after two years, 7.5% of women who took only tamoxifen had a recurrence, compared with 16% who took either paroxetine, fluoxetine or sertraline, drugs considered to be the most potent CYP2D6 inhibitors. That difference translates to a 120% increase in the risk of breast cancer recurrence. Patients taking the SSRIs Celexa (citalopram), Lexapro (escitalopram), and Luvox (fluvoxamine) did not have an increased risk of recurrence, due to their lack of competitive metabolism for the CYP2D6 enzyme. A newer study demonstrated a clearer and stronger effect from paroxetine in causing the worst outcomes. Patients treated with both paroxetine and tamoxifen have a 67% increased risk of death from breast cancer, from 24% to 91%, depending on the duration of coadministration. Tamoxifen interacts with certain other antiestrogens. The aromatase inhibitor aminoglutethimide induces the metabolism of tamoxifen. Conversely, the aromatase inhibitor letrozole does not affect the metabolism of tamoxifen. However, tamoxifen induces the metabolism of letrozole and significantly reduces its concentrations. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Selective estrogen receptor modulator activity ==== Tamoxifen acts as a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), or as a partial agonist of the estrogen receptors (ERs). It has mixed estrogenic and antiestrogenic activity, with its profile of effects differing by tissue. For instance, tamoxifen has predominantly antiestrogenic effects in the breasts but predominantly estrogenic effects in the uterus and liver. In breast tissue, tamoxifen acts as an ER antagonist so that transcription of estrogen-responsive genes is inhibited. A beneficial side effect of tamoxifen is that it prevents bone loss by acting as an ER agonist (i.e., mimicking the effects of estrogen) in this cell type. Therefore, by inhibiting osteoclasts, it prevents osteoporosis. When tamoxifen was launched as a drug, it was thought that tamoxifen would act as an ER antagonist in all tissues, including bone, and therefore it was feared that it would contribute to osteoporosis. It was therefore very surprising that the opposite effect was observed clinically. Hence tamoxifen's tissue selective action directly led to the formulation of the concept of SERMs. Tamoxifen is a long-acting SERM, with a nuclear retention of the ER–tamoxifen (or metabolite) complex of greater than 48 hours. It has relatively little affinity for the ERs itself and instead acts as a prodrug of active metabolites such as endoxifen (4-hydroxy-N-desmethyltamoxifen) and afimoxifene (4-hydroxytamoxifen; 4-OHT). These metabolites have approximately 30 to 100 times greater affinity for the ERs than tamoxifen itself. Per one study, tamoxifen had 7% and 6% of the affinity of estradiol for the ERα and ERβ, respectively, whereas afimoxifene had 178% and 338% of the affinity of estradiol for the ERα and ERβ, respectively. Hence, afimoxifene showed 25-fold higher affinity for the ERα and 56-fold higher affinity for the ERβ than tamoxifen. The antiestrogenic potencies of endoxifen and afimoxifene are very similar. However, endoxifen occurs in much higher concentrations than afimoxifene and is now thought to be the major active form of tamoxifen in the body. Tamoxifen binds to ER competitively (with respect to the endogenous agonist estrogen) in tumor cells and other tissue targets, producing a nuclear complex that decreases DNA synthesis and inhibits estrogen effects. It is a nonsteroidal agent with potent antiestrogenic properties which compete with estrogen for binding sites in breast and other tissues. Tamoxifen causes cells to remain in the G0 and G1 phases of the cell cycle. Because it prevents (pre)cancerous cells from dividing but does not cause cell death, tamoxifen is cytostatic rather than cytocidal. Tamoxifen binds to ER, the ER/tamoxifen complex recruits other proteins known as co-repressors, and the complex then binds to DNA to modulate gene expression. Some of these proteins include NCoR and SMRT. Tamoxifen function can be regulated by a number of different variables including growth factors. Tamoxifen needs to block growth factor proteins such as ErbB2/HER2 because high levels of ErbB2 have been shown to occur in tamoxifen resistant cancers. Tamoxifen seems to require a protein PAX2 for its full anticancer effect. In the presence of high PAX2 expression, the tamoxifen/ER complex is able to suppress the expression of the pro-proliferative ERBB2 protein. In contrast, when AIB-1 expression is higher than PAX2, tamoxifen/ER complex upregulates the expression of ERBB2 resulting in stimulation of breast cancer growth. Tamoxifen is antigonadotropic in postmenopausal women and partially suppresses levels of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in such women. However, it has progonadotropic effects in premenopausal women and increases estrogen levels by 6-fold in them. Due to the nature of tamoxifen as a competitive ER ligand, this increase in estrogen levels is liable to interfere with the antiestrogenic efficacy of tamoxifen. The effects of tamoxifen on breast cancer Ki-67 expression, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, and IGF-1 levels are dose-dependent across a dosage range of 1 to 20 mg/day in women with breast cancer. Tamoxifen has been found to decrease insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels by 17 to 38% in women and men. Suppression of IGF-1 production in the liver is a well-known action of estrogens and SERMs. A 10 mg/day dosage of tamoxifen is nearly as effective as a 20 mg/day dosage in suppressing IGF-1 levels. ==== Other activities ==== Afimoxifene is an agonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) with relatively low affinity. Its affinity for the receptor is in the range of 100 to 1,000 nM, relative to 3 to 6 nM for estradiol. In addition to its activity as a SERM, afimoxifene binds to both the estrogen-related receptor β and estrogen-related receptor γ and is an antagonist of the estrogen-related receptor γ (ERRγ). Norendoxifen (4-hydroxy-N,N-didesmethyltamoxifen), another active metabolite of tamoxifen, has been found to act as a potent competitive aromatase inhibitor (IC50 = 90 nM), and may also be involved in the antiestrogenic activity of tamoxifen. In addition to its activity as a SERM, tamoxifen is a potent and selective protein kinase C inhibitor, and is active in this regard at therapeutic concentrations. This action is thought to underlie the efficacy of tamoxifen in the treatment of bipolar disorder. Tamoxifen is an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein. In 2018, it was discovered that tamoxifen directly interacts with the dopamine transporter (DAT) and acts as an atypical dopamine reuptake inhibitor (DRI). It has weak potency (54% inhibition of dopamine uptake at 10 μM) and lacks any stimulant or depressant effects when administered by itself. However, tamoxifen dose-dependently blocks amphetamine-mediated dopamine release and psychostimulant-like effects in animals. This unusual profile of DRI activity has made tamoxifen of potential interest as a starting point for structural modification to develop novel pharmaceutical drugs for treatment of stimulant use disorder. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== Tamoxifen is rapidly and extensively absorbed from the intestines with oral administration. The oral bioavailability of tamoxifen is approximately 100%, which is suggestive of minimal first-pass metabolism in the intestines and liver. Following intake, peak levels of tamoxifen occur after three to seven hours. Steady state levels of tamoxifen are reached typically after 3 to 4 weeks but possibly up to 16 weeks of daily administration. Steady state levels of afimoxifene are achieved after 8 weeks of daily tamoxifen administration. Peak levels of tamoxifen after a single 40 mg oral dose were 65 ng/mL and steady state levels at 20 mg/day were 310 ng/mL. Levels of tamoxifen show clear dose dependency across a dosage range of 1 to 20 mg/day. Endoxifen levels are approximately 5 to 10 times higher than afimoxifene levels, with large interindividual variability. Endoxifen levels have been reported as 10.8 to 15.9 ng/mL at steady state in CYP2D6 normal metabolizers during therapy with 20 mg/day tamoxifen. The most abundant metabolites of tamoxifen in terms of circulating concentrations are N-desmethyltamoxifen, N,N-didesmethyltamoxifen, (Z)-endoxifen, and tamoxifen N-oxide. ==== Distribution ==== The volume of distribution of tamoxifen is 50 to 60 L/kg and its clearance has been estimated as 1.2 to 5.1 L/hour. High concentrations of tamoxifen have been found in breast, uterus, liver, kidney, lung, pancreas, and ovary tissue in animals and humans. Levels of tamoxifen in the uterus have been found to be 2- to 3-fold higher than in the circulation and in the breasts 10-fold higher than in the circulation. The plasma protein binding of tamoxifen and afimoxifene is greater than 99%. A majority of tamoxifen is bound to albumin. Albumin alone binds 98.8% of tamoxifen while other plasma proteins are not greatly involved. ==== Metabolism ==== Tamoxifen is a prodrug and is metabolized in the liver by the cytochrome P450 isoforms CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2D6 into active metabolites such as endoxifen (4-hydroxy-N-desmethyltamoxifen) and afimoxifene (4-hydroxytamoxifen). Conversion of tamoxifen by N-demethylation into N-desmethyltamoxifen, which is catalyzed primarily by CYP3A4 and CYP3A5, is responsible for approximately 92% of tamoxifen metabolism. Conversely, 4-hydroxylation of tamoxifen into afimoxifene is responsible for only about 7% of tamoxifen metabolism. Following its formation, N-desmethyltamoxifen is oxidized into several other metabolites, the most notable of which is endoxifen. Another active metabolite, norendoxifen (4-hydroxy-N,N-didesmethyltamoxifen), is formed via N-demethylation of endoxifen or 4-hydroxylation of N,N-didesmethyltamoxifen. Tamoxifen and its metabolites undergo conjugation, including glucuronidation and sulfation. Tamoxifen may inhibit its own metabolism. ==== Elimination ==== Tamoxifen has a long elimination half-life of typically 5 to 7 days, with a range of 4 to 11 days. Similarly, the half-life of afimoxifene is 14 days. Conversely, the half-life of endoxifen is 50 to 70 hours (2–3 days). The long half-lives of tamoxifen and afimoxifene are attributed to their high plasma protein binding as well as to enterohepatic recirculation. Upon discontinuation of treatment, levels of tamoxifen and its metabolites persist in the circulation for at least 6 weeks. Tamoxifen is excreted in bile and is eliminated in feces, while small amounts are eliminated in urine. == Chemistry == Tamoxifen is a nonsteroidal SERM of the triphenylethylene family and was structurally derived from diethylstilbestrol-like estrogens and antiestrogens such as chlorotrianisene and ethamoxytriphetol. Initially, clomifene was synthesized, and tamoxifen was developed subsequently. Tamoxifen is closely related structurally to other triphenylethylenes, such as clomifene, nafoxidine, ospemifene, toremifene, and numerous others. Other SERMs, like raloxifene, are structurally distinct from tamoxifen and other triphenylethylenes. == History == In the late 1950s, pharmaceutical companies were actively researching a newly discovered class of anti-estrogen compounds in the hope of developing a morning-after contraceptive pill. Arthur L Walpole was a reproductive endocrinologist who led such a team at the Alderley Park research laboratories of ICI Pharmaceuticals. It was there in 1962 that chemist Dora Richardson first synthesized tamoxifen, back then known as ICI-46,474, when she was looking to create triphenylethylene derivatives for the contraceptive pill project that her team was researching. This compound was originally created to work as an estrogen inhibitor, but instead was found to stimulate ovulation in participants of the drug testing trial. Walpole and his colleagues filed a UK patent covering this compound in 1962, but patent protection on this compound was repeatedly denied in the US until the 1980s. Tamoxifen did eventually receive marketing approval as a fertility treatment, but the class of compounds never proved useful in human contraception. A link between estrogen and breast cancer had been known for many years, but cancer treatments were not a corporate priority at the time, and Walpole's personal interests were important in keeping support for the compound alive in the face of this and the lack of patent protection. It was only when Walpole threatened to leave his position that corporate decided to allow trials and testing for tamoxifen as a drug that could be used to treat breast cancer. Without Walpole's effort towards defending the work that his team had done in discovering a possibly revolutionary source for breast cancer treatment, tamoxifen could have become a discarded or under-researched idea. Walpole's team consisted of Dora Richardson and G. A. Snow, who worked on the chemistry portion of the project, along with G. E. Paget and J. K. Walley, who focused primarily on the biological side. Tamoxifen is one of three drugs in an anti-angiogenetic protocol developed by Dr. Judah Folkman, a researcher at Children's Hospital at Harvard Medical School in Boston. Folkman discovered in the 1970s that angiogenesis – the growth of new blood vessels – plays a significant role in the development of cancer. Since his discovery, an entirely new field of cancer research has developed. Clinical trials on angiogenesis inhibitors have been underway since 1992 using many different drugs. The Harvard researchers developed a specific protocol for a golden retriever named Navy who was cancer-free after receiving the prescribed cocktail of celecoxib, doxycycline, and tamoxifen – the treatment subsequently became known as the Navy Protocol. Furthermore, tamoxifen treatment alone has been shown to have anti-angiogenetic effects in animal models of cancer which appear to be, at least in part, independent of tamoxifen's ER antagonist properties. Other antiestrogens, such as ethamoxytriphetol (MER-25) and clomifene (MRL-41), were assessed for treatment of breast cancer and found to be effective before tamoxifen, but were plagued with toxicity issues. The first clinical study of tamoxifen took place at the Christie Hospital in 1971, and showed a convincing effect in advanced breast cancer, but nevertheless ICI's development programme came close to termination when it was reviewed in 1972. In an unpublished article from the early days of the trial, Dora Richardson documented her team's excitement about tamoxifen's effects in counteracting infertility problems and the early positive effects found in breast cancer patients. Unfortunately, this work was not well received by everyone, as the team was supposed to be looking for a contraceptive pill. Tamoxifen's further development may have been bolstered by a second clinical study by Harold W.C. Ward at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. Ward's study showed a more definitive response to the drug at a higher dosage. Walpole also may have helped to convince the company to market tamoxifen for late stage breast cancer in 1973. He was also instrumental in funding V. Craig Jordan to work on tamoxifen. In 1972, ICI Pharmaceuticals Division abandoned development of tamoxifen for financial reasons. The drug was subsequently reinvented from a failed contraceptive, to become tamoxifen, the gold standard for the adjuvant treatment of breast cancer and the pioneering medicine for chemprevention for high-risk women. Two books, Estrogen Action, Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators and Women's Health (Imperial College Press 2013) and Tamoxifen: Pioneering Medicine in Breast Cancer (Springer 2013) tell this story. 1980 saw the publication of the first trial to show that tamoxifen given in addition to chemotherapy improved survival for patients with early breast cancer. In advanced disease, tamoxifen is now only recognized as effective in ER+ patients, but the early trials did not select ER+ patients, and by the mid-1980s the clinical trial picture was not showing a major advantage for tamoxifen. Nevertheless, tamoxifen had a relatively mild side-effect profile, and a number of large trials continued. The pharmacology of SERMs was discovered, defined, and deciphered during the 1980s. A clinical strategy was described that led to the creation of SERMs as a group of multifunctional medicines aimed at the treatment or prevention of many conditions in postmenopausal women, e.g. osteoporosis and breast cancer. The early sales of tamoxifen in both the UK and in the U.S. far exceeded ICI's original estimate, but despite this, at the annual portfolio review ICI's board members still asserted that \"there was no market for cancer\", leaving the drug's marketing success to rely on its clinical results and clinicians' and scientists' interests in it. Shortly after, Dora Richardson published a history of tamoxifen that, unusually for that type of paper, included personal accounts and letters from patients who attributed their healing to the drug. This testimony from cancer patients using tamoxifen helped to shape and push forward research, by justifying it both morally and scientifically to corporations. It was not until 1998 that the meta-analysis of the Oxford-based Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group showed definitively that tamoxifen was effective for early breast cancer. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Tamoxifen is marketed under the brand names Nolvadex and Soltamox, and a variety of other brand names throughout the world. === Economics === Global sales of tamoxifen in 2001 were approximately $1.02 billion. Since the expiration of the patent in 2002, it is widely available as a generic drug around the world. As of 2004, tamoxifen was the world's largest selling hormonal drug for the treatment of breast cancer. == Research == In McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) tamoxifen has been used to treat premature puberty and the consequences of premature puberty. Tamoxifen has been seen to decrease rapid bone maturation which is the result of excessive estrogen and alter predicted adult height (PAH). The same effects have also been seen in short pubertal boys. However, one in vitro study in 2007 and later an in vivo study in 2008 have shown that tamoxifen induces apoptosis in growth plate chondrocytes, reduces serum insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels and causes persistent retardation of longitudinal and cortical radial bone growth in young male rats, leading the researchers to express concern giving tamoxifen to growing individuals. Tamoxifen has been studied in the treatment of the rare conditions of retroperitoneal fibrosis and idiopathic sclerosing mesenteritis. It has also been proposed as part of a treatment plan for Riedel's thyroiditis. Tamoxifen is used as a research tool to trigger tissue-specific gene expression in many conditional expression constructs in genetically modified animals including a version of the Cre-Lox recombination technique. While widely used in transgenic research, the strong anabolic effect of tamoxifen on bone might confound this approach, especially as it relates to bone-targeted constructs. Tamoxifen may be effective in the treatment of mania in people with bipolar disorder. This is thought to be due to blockade of protein kinase C (PKC), an enzyme that regulates neuron activity in the brain. Researchers believe PKC is overactive during the mania in bipolar patients. As of September 2019, endoxifen, a major active metabolite of tamoxifen with a 4-fold more potent PKC inhibition, was in phase III clinical trials for bipolar disorder. == References == == Further reading == Dean L (2014). \"Tamoxifen Therapy and CYP2D6 Genotype\".

         " The relationship among the gut microbiome, global fecal metabolites and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has not been systematically evaluated. In this study, we performed 16S rDNA sequencing and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based nontargeted metabolomic profiling on feces of 26 untreated RA patients and 26 healthy controls. Twenty-six genera and forty-one MS2-identified metabolites were significantly altered in the RA patients.  Myocardial infarction (MI) is a serious cardiovascular disease, which presents different pathophysiological changes with the prolongation of the disease. Compound danshen dripping pills (CDDP) has obvious advantages in MI treatment and widely used in the clinic. However, the current studies were mostly focused on the endpoint of CDDP intervention, lacking the dynamic attention to the disease process. It is of great value to establish a dynamic research strategy focused on the changes in pharmacodynamic substances for guiding clinical medication more precisely. It is aimed to explore the dynamic regulating pattern of CDDP on MI based on metabolic trajectory analysis, and then clarify the variation characteristic biomarkers and pharmacodynamic substances in the intervention process. The MI model was successfully prepared by coronary artery left anterior descending branch ligation, and then CDDP intervention was given for 28 days. Endogenous metabolites and the components of CDDP in serum were measured by LC/MS technique simultaneously to identify dynamic the metabolic trajectory and screen the characteristic pharmacodynamic substances at different points. Finally, network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques were used to simulate the core pharmacodynamic substances and core target binding, then validated at the genetic and protein level by Q-PCR and western blotting technology. CDDP performed typical dynamic regulation features on metabolite distribution, biological processes, and pharmacodynamic substances. During 1-7 days, it mainly regulated lipid metabolism and inflammation, the Phosphatidylcholine (PC(18:1(9Z/18:1(9Z)) and Sphingomyelin (SM(d18:1/23:1(9Z)), SM(d18:1/24:1(15Z)), SM(d18:0/16:1(9Z))) were the main characteristic biomarkers. Lipid metabolism was the mainly regulation pathway during 14-21 days, and the characteristic biomarkers were the Lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LysoPE(0:0/20:0), PE-NMe2(22:1(13Z)/15:0)) and Sphingomyelin (SM(d18:1/23:1(9Z))). At 28 days, in addition to inflammatory response and lipid metabolism, fatty acid metabolism also played the most important role. Correspondingly, Lysophosphatidylcholine (LysoPC(20:0/0:0)), Lysophosphatidylserine (LPS(18:0/0:0)) and Fatty acids (Linoelaidic acid) were the characteristic biomarkers. Based on the results of metabolite distribution and biological process, the characteristic pharmacodynamic substances during the intervention were further identified. The results showed that various kinds of Saponins and Tanshinones as the important active ingredients performed a long-range regulating effect on MI. And the other components, such as Tanshinol and Salvianolic acid B affected Phosphatidylcholine and Sphingomyelin through Relaxin Signaling pathway during the early intervention. Protocatechualdehyde and Rosmarinic acid affected Lysophosphatidylethanolamine and Sphingomyelin through EGFR Tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance during the late intervention. Tanshinone IIB and Isocryptotanshinone via PPAR signaling pathway affected Lysophosphatidylcholine, Lysophosphatidylserine, and Fatty acids. The dynamic regulating pattern was taken as the entry point and constructs the dynamic network based on metabolic trajectory analysis, establishes the dynamic correlation between the drug-derived components and the endogenous metabolites, and elucidates the characteristic biomarkers affecting the changes of the pharmacodynamic indexes, systematically and deeply elucidate the pharmacodynamic substance and mechanism of CDDP on MI. It also enriched the understanding of CDDP and provided a methodological reference for the dynamic analysis of complex systems of TCM. Background: To improve the grade of beef marbling has great economic value in the cattle industry since marbling has the traits of high quality and comprehensive nutrition. And because of the marbling’s importance and complexity, it is indispensable to explore marbled beef at multiple levels. This experiment studied the relationship between fecal metabolites and marbling characters, and further screened biomarkers. Results: We performed fecal metabolomics analysis on 30 individuals selected from 100 crossbreed cattle (Luxi Yellow cattle ♀ × Japanese Wagyu cattle ♂), 15 with an extremely high-grade marbling beef and 15 with an extremely low-grade marbling beef. A total of 9959 and 8389 m/z features were detected in positive ionization and negative ionization mode by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Unfortunately, the sample separation in the PCA is not obvious, and the predictive ability of the orthogonal partial least squares discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA) model is not good. However, we got six differential metabolites filtered by VIP > 1 and p < 0.05. After that, we used weighted correlation network analysis (WGCNA) and found out a module in each positive and negative mode most related to the trait of marbling beef, and then identified three metabolites in positive mode. By further annotation of the Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (KEGG), it was found that these metabolites involved a variety of metabolic ways, including sphingomyelin metabolism, linoleic acid metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and so on. Finally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the predictability of metabolites, and the result showed that SM(d18:0/16:1(9Z)) (AUC = 0.72), PC(15:0/18:2(9Z,12Z)) (AUC = 0.72), ADP (AUC = 0.71), PC(16:0/16:0) (AUC = 0.73), and 3-O-Sulfogalactosylceramide (d18:1/18:0) (AUC = 0.69) have an accuracy diagnosis. Conclusions: In conclusion, this study supports new opinions for the successive evaluation of marbling beef through metabolites. Furthermore, six non-invasive fecal metabolites that can evaluate beef marbling grade were found, including SM(d18:0/16:1(9Z)), PC(15:0/18:2(9Z,12Z)), ADP, PC(16:0/16:0), and 3-O-Sulfogalactosylceramide.",

         " Niemann-Pick disease type C is a rare lysosomal storage disorder. We evaluated the safety and efficacy of  In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, we randomly assigned patients 4 years of age or older with genetically confirmed Niemann-Pick disease type C in a 1:1 ratio to receive NALL for 12 weeks, followed by placebo for 12 weeks, or to receive placebo for 12 weeks, followed by NALL for 12 weeks. NALL or matching placebo was administered orally two to three times per day, with patients 4 to 12 years of age receiving weight-based doses (2 to 4 g per day) and those 13 years of age or older receiving a dose of 4 g per day. The primary end point was the total score on the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA; range, 0 to 40, with lower scores indicating better neurologic status). Secondary end points included scores on the Clinical Global Impression of Improvement, the Spinocerebellar Ataxia Functional Index, and the Modified Disability Rating Scale. Crossover data from the two 12-week periods in each group were included in the comparisons of NALL with placebo. A total of 60 patients 5 to 67 years of age were enrolled. The mean baseline SARA total scores used in the primary analysis were 15.88 before receipt of the first dose of NALL (60 patients) and 15.68 before receipt of the first dose of placebo (59 patients; 1 patient never received placebo). The mean (±SD) change from baseline in the SARA total score was -1.97±2.43 points after 12 weeks of receiving NALL and -0.60±2.39 points after 12 weeks of receiving placebo (least-squares mean difference, -1.28 points; 95% confidence interval, -1.91 to -0.65; P<0.001). The results for the secondary end points were generally supportive of the findings in the primary analysis, but these were not adjusted for multiple comparisons. The incidence of adverse events was similar with NALL and placebo, and no treatment-related serious adverse events occurred. Among patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C, treatment with NALL for 12 weeks led to better neurologic status than placebo. A longer period is needed to determine the long-term effects of this agent in patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C. (Funded by IntraBio; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT05163288; EudraCT number, 2021-005356-10.). To investigate the safety and efficacy of N-acetyl-L-leucine (NALL) on symptoms, functioning, and quality of life in pediatric (≥ 6 years) and adult Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC) patients. In this multi-national, open-label, rater-blinded Phase II study, patients were assessed during a baseline period, a 6-week treatment period (orally administered NALL 4 g/day in patients ≥ 13 years, weight-tiered doses for patients 6-12 years), and a 6-week post-treatment washout period. The primary Clinical Impression of Change in Severity (CI-CS) endpoint (based on a 7-point Likert scale) was assessed by blinded, centralized raters who compared randomized video pairs of each patient performing a pre-defined primary anchor test (8-Meter Walk Test or 9-Hole Peg Test) during each study periods. Secondary outcomes included cerebellar functional rating scales, clinical global impression, and quality of life assessments. 33 subjects aged 7-64 years with a confirmed diagnosis of NPC were enrolled. 32 patients were included in the primary modified intention-to-treat analysis. NALL met the CI-CS primary endpoint (mean difference 0.86, SD = 2.52, 90% CI 0.25, 1.75, p = 0.029), as well as secondary endpoints. No treatment-related serious adverse events occurred. NALL demonstrated a statistically significant and clinical meaningfully improvement in symptoms, functioning, and quality of life in 6 weeks, the clinical effect of which was lost after the 6-week washout period. NALL was safe and well-tolerated, informing a favorable benefit-risk profile for the treatment of NPC. CLINICALTRIALS. NCT03759639.",

Second, we assessed their translatability to human tissue and plasma for cardiovascular risk estimation. In this observational study, mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) was applied to identify region-specific metabolic differences between atherosclerotic (n=11) and control (n=11) aortas from low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice, via histology-guided virtual microdissection. Early and advanced plaques were compared within the same atherosclerotic animals. Progression metabolites were further analyzed by MSI in 9 human atherosclerotic carotids and by targeted mass spectrometry in human plasma from subjects with elective coronary artery bypass grafting (cardiovascular risk group, n=27) and a control group (n=27). MSI identified 362 local metabolic alterations in atherosclerotic mice (log2 fold-change ≥1.5;  An altered phospholipid metabolism occurs in atherosclerosis, affecting both the aorta and the adjacent heart tissue. Plaque-progression lipids LPC(18:0) and LPA(18:1), as identified by MSI on tissue, reflect cardiovascular risk in human plasma. In human subjects and animal models with acute and chronic lung injury, the bioactive lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) is elevated in lung lining fluids. The increased LPC can promote an inflammatory microenvironment resulting in lung injury. Furthermore, pathological lung conditions are associated with upregulated phospholipase A2 (PLA2), the predominant enzyme producing LPC in tissues by hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine. However, the lung cell populations responsible for increases of LPC have yet to be systematically characterized. The goal was to investigate the LPC generation by bronchial epithelial cells in response to pathological mediators and determine the major LPC species produced. Primary human bronchial epithelial cells (NHBE) were challenged by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for 1 or 6 h, and condition medium and cells collected for quantification of predominant LPC species by high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). The cells were analyzed by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for PLA2. The direct effects of LPC in inducing inflammatory activities on NHBE were assessed by transepithelial resistance as well as expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) and matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1). VEGF stimulation of NHBE for 1 or 6 h, significantly increased concentrations of LPC16:0, LPC18:0, and LPC18:1 in condition medium compared to control. The sPLA2-selective inhibitor (oleyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine) inhibited the VEGF-induced release of LPC16:0 and LPC18:1 and PLA2 activity. In contrast, NHBE stimulated with TNF did not induce LPC release. VEGF did not increase mRNA of PLA2 subtypes sPLA2-X, sPLA2-XIIa, cPLA2-IVa, and iPLA2-VI. Exogenous LPC treatment increased expression of IL-8 and MMP-1, and reduced the transepithelial resistance in NHBE. Our findings indicate that VEGF-stimulated bronchial epithelial cells are a key source of extracellular LPCs, which can function as an autocrine mediator with potential to induce airway epithelial inflammatory injury. Neuropathic pain is a maladaptive and chronic condition with limited effective treatments. Although recent studies have suggested that certain lipid metabolites, like lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), may contribute to chronic pain, their specific roles and mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated the role and mechanism of LPC(18:1), a lipid subtype, in neuropathic pain caused by nerve injury. Using a mouse model of spinal nerve ligation, LPC(18:1) levels were measured in serum, dorsal root ganglion (DRG), spinal cord (SC) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Nociception was assessed using von Frey and Hargreaves' methods, while molecular analyses explored inflammatory pathways and oxidative stress. LPC(18:1) levels significantly increased in the serum, DRG and CSF after nerve injury. Administration of LPC(18:1) induced heightened pain responses and activated inflammatory pathways, including protein kinase C (PKC) and extracellular regulated protein kinase (ERK) in the DRG, as well as glial cells in the SC. The findings suggested that oxidative stress played a role in LPC(18:1) production, and its effects were mediated by G protein-coupled receptor 132 (GPR132). LPC(18:1) may serve as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for managing neuropathic pain.",

         "Lecithin ( LESS-ith-in; from the Ancient Greek λέκιθος lékithos \"yolk\") is a generic term to designate any group of yellow-brownish fatty substances occurring in animal and plant tissues which are amphiphilic – they attract both water and fatty substances (and so are both hydrophilic and lipophilic), and are used for smoothing food textures, emulsifying, homogenizing liquid mixtures, and repelling sticking materials. Lecithins are mixtures of glycerophospholipids including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidic acid. Lecithin was first isolated in 1845 by the French chemist and pharmacist Théodore Gobley. In 1850, he named the phosphatidylcholine lécithine. Gobley originally isolated lecithin from egg yolk and established the complete chemical formula of phosphatidylcholine in 1874; in between, he demonstrated the presence of lecithin in a variety of biological materials, including venous blood, human lungs, bile, roe, and brains of humans, sheep and chicken. Lecithin can easily be extracted chemically using solvents such as hexane, ethanol, acetone, petroleum ether or benzene; or extraction can be done mechanically. Common sources include egg yolk, marine foods, soybeans, milk, rapeseed, cottonseed, and sunflower oil. It has low solubility in water, but is an excellent emulsifier. In aqueous solution, its phospholipids can form either liposomes, bilayer sheets, micelles, or lamellar structures, depending on hydration and temperature. This results in a type of surfactant that usually is classified as amphipathic. Lecithin is sold as a food additive and dietary supplement. In cooking, it is sometimes used as an emulsifier and to prevent sticking, for example in non-stick cooking spray. == Production == Commercial lecithin, as used by food manufacturers, is a mixture of phospholipids in oil. The lecithin can be obtained by water degumming the extracted oil of seeds. It is a mixture of various phospholipids, and the composition depends on the origin of the lecithin. A major source of lecithin is soybean oil. Because of the EU requirement to declare additions of allergens in foods, in addition to regulations regarding genetically modified crops, a gradual shift to other sources of lecithin (such as sunflower lecithin) is taking place. The main phospholipids in lecithin from soy and sunflower are phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, and phosphatidic acid. They are often abbreviated to PC, PI, PE, PS and PA, respectively. Purified phospholipids are produced by companies commercially. === Hydrolysed lecithin === To modify the performance of lecithin to make it suitable for the product to which it is added, it may be hydrolysed enzymatically. In hydrolysed lecithins, a portion of the phospholipids have one fatty acid removed by phospholipase. Such phospholipids are called lysophospholipids. The most commonly used phospholipase is phospholipase A2, which removes the fatty acid at the C2 position of glycerol. Lecithins may also be modified by a process called fractionation. During this process, lecithin is mixed with an alcohol, usually ethanol. Some phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine, have good solubility in ethanol, whereas most other phospholipids do not dissolve well in ethanol. The ethanol is separated from the lecithin sludge, after which the ethanol is removed by evaporation to obtain a phosphatidylcholine-enriched lecithin fraction. === Genetically modified crops as a source of lecithin === As described above, lecithin is highly processed. Therefore, genetically modified (GM) protein or DNA from the original GM crop from which it is derived often is undetectable – in other words, it is not substantially different from lecithin derived from non-GM crops. Nonetheless, consumer concerns about genetically modified food have extended to highly purified derivatives from GM food, such as lecithin. This concern led to policy and regulatory changes in the EU in 2000, when Commission Regulation (EC) 50/2000 was passed which required labelling of food containing additives derived from GMOs, including lecithin. Because it is nearly impossible to detect the origin of derivatives such as lecithin, the European regulations require those who wish to sell lecithin in Europe to use a meticulous, but essential system of identity preservation (IP). == Properties and applications == Lecithins have emulsification and lubricant properties, and are a surfactant. They can be completely metabolized (see inositol) by humans, so are well tolerated by humans and nontoxic when ingested. The major components of commercial soybean-derived lecithin are: 33–35% soybean oil 20–21% phosphatidylinositols 19–21% phosphatidylcholine 8–20% phosphatidylethanolamine 5–11% other phosphatides including phosphatidylserine 5% free carbohydrates 2–5% sterols 1% moisture Lecithin is used for applications in human food, animal feed, pharmaceuticals, paints, and other industrial applications. Applications include: In the pharmaceutical industry, it acts as a wetting agent, stabilizing agent and a choline enrichment carrier, helps in emulsification and encapsulation, and is a good dispersing agent. It can be used in manufacture of intravenous fat infusions and for therapeutic use. In animal feed, it enriches fat and protein and improves pelletization. In the paint industry, it forms protective coatings for surfaces with painting and printing ink, helps as a rust inhibitor, is a colour intensifying agent, catalyst, conditioning aid modifier, and dispersing aid; it is a good stabilizing and suspending agent, emulsifier, and wetting agent, helps in maintaining uniform mixture of several pigments, helps in grinding of metal oxide pigments, is a spreading and mixing aid, prevents hard settling of pigments, eliminates foam in water-based paints, and helps in fast dispersion of latex-based paints. Lecithin also may be used as a release agent for plastics, an anti-sludge additive in motor lubricants, an anti-gumming agent in gasoline, and an emulsifier, spreading agent, and antioxidant in textile, rubber, and other industries. === Food additive === The nontoxicity of lecithin leads to its use with food, as a food additive or in food preparation. It is used commercially in foods requiring a natural emulsifier or lubricant. In confectionery, it reduces viscosity, replaces more expensive ingredients, controls sugar crystallization and the flow properties of chocolate, helps in the homogeneous mixing of ingredients, improves shelf life for some products, and can be used as a coating. In emulsions and fat spreads, such as margarines with a high fat content of more than 75%, it stabilizes emulsions, reduces spattering (splashing and scattering of oil droplets) during frying, improves texture of spreads and flavor release. In doughs and baking, it reduces fat and egg requirements, helps even out distribution of ingredients in dough, stabilizes fermentation, increases volume, protects yeast cells in dough when frozen, and acts as a releasing agent to prevent sticking and simplify cleaning. It improves wetting properties of hydrophilic powders (such as low-fat proteins) and lipophilic powders (such as cocoa powder), controls dust, and helps complete dispersion in water. Lecithin keeps cocoa and cocoa butter in a candy bar from separating. It can be used as a component of cooking sprays to prevent sticking and as a releasing agent. In the EU Lecithin is designated at food additive E322. === Dietary supplement === Lecithin contains dietary precursors to choline, an essential nutrient, which was formerly classified as a B vitamin (vitamin B4). Lecithin is a mixture of fats that contains phospholipids, including phosphatidylcholine, and the human body can convert phosphatidylcholine into choline. The choline content in lecithin can vary, but it's found that phosphatidylcholine makes up about 25 to 35 percent of lecithin. Furthermore, only about 12 percent of phosphatidylcholine is actually choline. This adds up to a choline content of approximately 4 percent for lecithin. For example, 10 grams of lecithin has 2,500mg of phosphatidylcholine. Phosphatidylcholine is approximately 13.7% choline; as such, about 342mg of choline is present per 10 grams of lecithin. Therefore, 10 grams of lecithin can be a source for the body to produce about the same amount of choline (342mg) as can be produced by the body from 2 egg yolks. The recommended intake of choline varies depending on age, sex, and physiological conditions, and is roughly 500 mg per day for adults. Lecithin is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA. There is no robust, scientifically validated clinical research investigating the safety and effectiveness of high-dose lecithin supplementation in lactating women and their infants. A meta-analysis found no evidence that high doses of lecithin improved milk flow in breast-feeding mothers or infants, though concluded that \"higher maternal choline intake was likely to be associated with better child neurocognition and neurodevelopment.\" Soy lecithin does not contain enough allergenic proteins for most people allergic to soy, although the US FDA only exempts a few soy lecithin products from its mandatory requirements for allergenic source labeling. An alternative source of lecithin, derived from sunflowers, is available as a dietary supplement for those with concerns about soy-based foods. A 2003 review of randomized trials found no benefit of lecithin in people with dementia. === Religious restrictions === Soy-derived lecithin is considered by some to be kitniyot and prohibited on Passover for Ashkenazi Jews when many grain-based foods are forbidden, but not at other times. This does not necessarily affect Sephardi Jews, who do not have the same restrictions on rice and kitniyot during Passover. Muslims are not forbidden to eat lecithin per se; however, since it may be derived from animal as well as plant sources, care must be taken to ensure the source is halal. Lecithin derived from plants and egg yolks is permissible, as is that derived from animals slaughtered according to the rules of dhabihah. Sunflower lecithin, sourced from the seeds of sunflowers, is entirely plant-based and may be an option for those with religious or cultural concerns regarding food intake. == See also == Phytosome == References == == External links == Introduction to Lecithin Archived 2020-11-27 at the Wayback Machine (University of Erlangen) FDA Industry guideline for soy lecithin labeling European Lecithin Manufacturers Association official website Shurtleff W, Aoyagi A (2016).

         " The macrocyclic tetrapeptide CJ-15,208 ( Recently, the tryptophan-containing noncationizable opioid peptides emerged with atypical structure and unexpected in vivo activity. Herein, we describe analogs of the naturally occurring mixed κ/μ-ligand c[Phe-d-Pro-Phe-Trp] 1 (CJ-15,208). Receptor affinity, selectivity, and agonism/antagonism varied upon enlarging macrocycle size, giving the μ-agonist 9 or the δ-antagonist 10 characterized by low nanomolar affinity. In particular, the μ-agonist c[β-Ala-d-Pro-Phe-Trp] 9 was shown to elicit potent antinociception in a mouse model of visceral pain upon systemic administration. Eps15 homology (EH) domains interact with proteins involved in endocytosis and signal transduction. EH domains bind to Asn-Pro-Phe (NPF) consensus motifs of target proteins. A few EH domains, such as the third EH domain (EH(3)) of human Eps15, prefer to bind Phe-Trp (FW) sequences. The structure of EH(3) has been solved by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and is the first of an FW- and NPF-binding EH domain. Both FW and NPF sequences bind in the same hydrophobic pocket as shown by heteronuclear chemical shift mapping. EH(3) contains the dual EF-hand fold characteristic of the EH domain family, but it binds calcium with high affinity in the first EF-hand rather than the usual coordination in the second EF-hand. Point mutations were designed based on differences in the EH(3) and the second EH domain (EH(2)) of human Eps15 that alter the affinity of the domains for FW or NPF motif peptides. Peptides that mimic binding sites in the potential EH(3) targets Rab, synaptojanin, and the cation-dependent mannose 6-phosphate receptor were used to explore wild-type and mutant affinities. Characterization of the structure and binding properties of an FW- and NPF-binding EH domain and comparison to an NPF-specific EH domain provide important insights into the mechanisms of EH domain ligand recognition.",

This compound has been shown to be relatively stable for a period of twenty-four hours post-mortem and the concentration of NAA is not changed by insulin-induced hypoglycemia. MAO inhibitors lower its concentration while reserpine and other drugs increase it. NAA has been implicated in many processes of the nervous system: it may be involved in the regulation of neuronal protein synthesis, myelin production, or the metabolism of several neurotransmitters such as aspartate or N-acetyl-aspartyl-glutamate.

         " Metabolic reprogramming plays an important role in the development of prostate cancer (PCa). However, there are few reports on the effects of nanomaterials as vectors on cancer metabolic reprogramming. Herein, a type of nanoparticle with good biocompatibility was synthesized by modifying the double-stranded of DNA containing a sulfhydryl group on the surface of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs-dsDNA) through salt-aging conjugation methods. The resultant AuNPs-dsDNA complexes possessed low toxicity to PC3 and DU145 cells in vitro. There was also no obvious hepatorenal toxicity after intravenous injection of AuNPs-dsDNA complexes in vivo, which indicated that these nanoparticles had good biological compatibilities. We investigated their biological functions using prostate cancer cells. Seahorse assay showed that AuNPs-dsDNA complexes could increase glycolysis and glycolysis capacity both in PC3 and DU145 cells. We further detected the expression of glycolysis-related genes by qPCR assay, and found that PKM2, PDHA, and LDHA were significantly upregulated. Furthermore, untargeted metabolomics revealed that PC (18:2(9Z,12Z)/18:2(9Z,12Z)) and PC (18:0/18:2 (9Z,12Z)) levels were decreased and inosinic acid level was increased in PC3 cells. Whereas (3S,6E,10E)-1,6,10,14-Phytatetraen-3-ol, Plasmenyl-PE 36:5 and Cer (d18:2/18:2) were decreased, PE 21:3 and 1-pyrrolidinecarboxaldehyde were increased in DU145 cells after co-culturing with AuNPs-dsDNA. In summary, we found that AuNPs and AuNPs-dsDNA complexes possibly regulate the metabolic reprogramming of cancer cells mainly through the lipid metabolic pathways, which could compensate for the previously mentioned phenomenon of enhanced glycolysis and glycolysis capacity. This will provide an important theoretical basis for our future research on the characteristic targeted design of nanomaterials for cancer metabolism. Pangasius hypopthalmus is well known as a good source of protein. However, Pangasius hypopthalmus meat (PHM) can be adulterated with pork for economic concern, thus, analytical methods for authentication are required. Untargeted metabolomics and proteomics using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) and chemometrics of principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) was successfully used to differentiate authentic and adulterated PHM with the good of fitness (R > 0.95) and good of predictivity (Q > 0.5). Metabolites of PC(o-18:0/18:2(9Z,12Z)) was found to be a potential marker for pork whereas DMPC (dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine) was a potential marker for PHM. Meanwhile, pork peptide marker of myoglobin (HPGDFGADAQGAMSK) and β-hemoglobin (FFESFGDLSNADAVMGNPK) could be identified. Both metabolomics and proteomics using LC-HRMS could detect pork at the lowest concentration level (0.5% w/w). In conclusion, untargeted metabolomics and proteomics using LC-HRMS in combination with chemometrics could be used as powerful methods to detect pork adulteration in fish meat. Understanding and elucidating the diverse structures and functions of lipids has motivated the development of many innovative tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) strategies. Higher-energy activation methods, such as ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD), generate unique fragment ions from glycerophospholipids that can be used to perform in-depth structural analysis and facilitate the deconvolution of isomeric lipid structures in complex samples. Although detailed characterization is central to the correlation of lipid structure to biological function, it is often impeded by the lack of sufficient instrument sensitivity for highly bioactive but low-abundance phospholipids. Here, we present precursor exclusion (PEx) UVPD, a simple yet powerful technique to enhance the signal-to-noise (S/N) of informative low-abundance fragment ions produced from UVPD of glycerophospholipids.

The clinical data of 12 patients, all sensitised by one particular baby body lotion containing 0.3% of the emulsifier, are presented. The cross-reaction pattern of oleamidopropyl dimethylamine was investigated by patch testing 13 patients allergic to the emulsifier with a series of related amideamine type emulsifiers.

Geniposide is an iridoid compound highly expressed in gardenia jasminoides for removing annoyance. The activity of geniposide against depression has been widely studied while most studies concentrated on the expression levels of gene and protein. Herein, the aim of the present study was to employ non-target metabolomic platform of serum to investigate metabolic changes of depression mice and further verify in hippocampus for analyzing the antidepressant mechanism of geniposide. Then we discovered that 9 metabolites of serum were significantly increased in depressive group (prostaglandin E2, leukotriene C4, arachidonic acid, phosphatidylcholine (PC, 16:0/16:0), LysoPC (18:1 (9Z)/0:0), phosphatidylethanolamine (14:0/16:0), creatine, oleamide and aminomalonic acid) and 6 metabolites were decreased (indoxylsulfuric acid, testosterone, lactic acid, glucose 6-phosphate, leucine and valine). The levels of arachidonic acid, LysoPC, lactic acid and glucose 6-phosphate in hippocampus were consistent change with serum in depression mice. Most of them showed significant tendencies to be normal by geniposide treatment. Metabolic pathway analysis indicated that arachidonic acid metabolism and glucose metabolism were the main pathogenesis for the antidepressant effect of geniposide. In addition, the levels of serum tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1 were increased in depressive mice and reversed after geniposide treatment. This study revealed that abnormal metabolism of inflammatory response and glucose metabolism of the serum and hippocampus involved in the occurrence of depressive disorder and antidepressant effect of geniposide. To explore the metabolic differences of follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) by metabonomics, to find potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of FTC, and to explore the pathogenesis and diagnosis and treatment strategies of FTC. The metabonomics of 15 patients with FTC and 15 patients with follicular thyroid nodules(FTN) treated in Henan Cancer Hospital were analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The analysis showed that the metabolite profiles of FTC tissues could be well distinguished from those of control tissues, and 6 kinds of lipids were identified respectively, including lysophosphatidic acid(LysoPA) [LysoPA(0:0/18:0),LysoPA(0:0/18:2(9Z,12Z)],LysoPA[20:4(8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)/0:0)]; phosphatidic acid(PA) [PA(20:3(8Z,11Z,14Z)/0:0),PA(20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)/0:0),PA(20:5(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)/0:0)]; lysophosphatidylcholine(LPC) [LPC(18:1),LPC(16:0),LPC[16:1(9Z)/0:0],LPC(17:0),LPC[22:4(7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z),LPC(20:2(11Z,14Z); phosphatidylcholine(PC)(PC(14:0/0:0),PC(16:0/0:0); sphingomyelin(SM) (d18:0/12:0); fatty acid(FA)(18:1(OH3)]. There are 2 kinds of amino acids, including L-glutamate,L-glutamine.There are 3 other metabolites, including retinol,flavin adenine dinucleotide,androsterone glucuronide.Lipid metabolites are the main metabolites in these metabolites.The metabolic pathways related to FTC were analyzed by KEGG and HMDB, and 9 metabolic pathways were found, including 4 amino acid related metabolic pathways, 1 lipid metabolic pathways and 4 other related pathways. There are significant differences in many metabonomic characteristics between FTC and FTN, suggesting that these metabolites can be used as potential biomarkers. Further study found that LysoPA and its analogues can be used as biomarkers in the early diagnosis of FTC.It may be related to the abnormal metabolism of phospholipase D (PLD), the key enzyme of LysoPA synthesis caused by RAS pathway. At the same time, it was found that the metabolic pathway of amino acids and lipids was the main metabolic pathway of FTC. The abnormality of LysoPA may be the cause of follicular tumor carcinogenesis caused by lipid metabolic pathway. Our aim was to identify changes in the metabolome in dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) as well as to construct a metabolic diagnostic model for DCM. We utilized non-targeted metabolomics with a cross-sectional cohort of age- and sex-matched DCM patients and controls. Metabolomics data were analyzed using orthogonal partial least squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) and pathway analysis. It was validated in combination with transcriptome sequencing data from public databases. Machine learning models were used for the diagnosis of DCM. Using multiple analytical techniques, 130 metabolite alterations were identified in DCM compared to healthy controls. Perturbations in glycerophospholipid metabolism (GPL) were identified and validated as a characteristic metabolic pathway in DCM. Through the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), we identified the 7 most important GPL metabolites, including LysoPA (16:0/0:0), LysoPA (18:1(9Z)/0:0), PC (20:3(8Z,11Z,14Z)/20:1(11Z)), PC (20:0/14:0), LysoPC (16:0), PS(15:0/18:0), and PE(16:0/20:4 (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)). The machine learning models based on the seven metabolites all had good accuracy in distinguishing DCM [All area under the curve (AUC) > 0.900], and the artificial neural network (ANN) model performed the most consistently (AUC: 0.919 ± 0.075). This study demonstrates that GPL metabolism may play a contributing role in the pathophysiological mechanisms of DCM. The 7-GPL metabolite model may help for early diagnosis of DCM.",

         " Lipid hydroperoxides are the primary reaction products of lipid oxidation, a natural outcome of life under oxygen. While playing a major role in cell metabolism, the microscopic origins of the effects of lipid hydroperoxidation on biomembranes remain elusive. Here we probe the polar structure of partially to fully hydroperoxidized bilayers of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) by a combination of environment-sensitive fluorescent probes and coarse-grained Martini numerical simulations. We find that the inserted organic hydroperoxide group -OOH migrates preferentially to the surface for bilayers with small fractions of hydroperoxidized lipids, but populates also significantly the bilayer interior for larger fractions. Our findings suggest that by modifying the intimate polarity of biomembranes, lipid peroxidation will have a significant impact on the activity of transmembrane proteins and on the bio-medical efficiency of membrane active molecules such as cell-penetrating and antimicrobial peptides. We have investigated the adsorption of the amyloid-forming protein α-Synuclein (αSyn) onto small unilamellar vesicles composed of a mixture of zwitterionic POPC and anionic POPS lipids. αSyn monomers adsorb onto the anionic lipid vesicles where they adopt an α-helical secondary structure. The degree of adsorption depends on the fraction of anionic lipid in the mixed lipid membrane, but one needs to consider the electrostatic shift of the serine p Conformational states of phospholipid chains in ternary mixtures of 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), deuterated 1,2-dipalmitoyl-d62-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DPPC",

         "Stearic acid ( STEER-ik, stee-ARR-ik) is a saturated fatty acid with an 18-carbon chain. The IUPAC name is octadecanoic acid. It is a soft waxy solid with the formula CH3(CH2)16CO2H. The triglyceride derived from three molecules of stearic acid is called stearin. Stearic acid is a prevalent fatty-acid in nature, found in many animal and vegetable fats, but is usually higher in animal fat than vegetable fat. It has a melting point of 69.4 °C (156.9 °F) °C and a pKa of 4.50. Its name comes from the Greek word στέαρ \"stéar\", which means tallow. The salts and esters of stearic acid are called stearates. As its ester, stearic acid is one of the most common saturated fatty acids found in nature and in the food supply, following palmitic acid. Dietary sources of stearic acid include meat, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, and foods prepared with fats; beef tallow, lard, butterfat, cocoa butter, and shea butter are rich fat sources of stearic acid. == Production == In terms of its biosynthesis, stearic acid is produced from palmitoyl-CoA, with malonyl-CoA a two-carbon building block (after decarboxylation). Stearic acid is obtained from fats and oils by the saponification of the triglycerides using hot water (about 100 °C). The resulting mixture is then distilled. Commercial stearic acid is often a mixture of stearic and palmitic acids, although purified stearic acid is available. Commercially, oleic acid, as found in palm and soy, can be hydrogenated to give stearic acid. == Uses and occurrence == In general, the applications of stearic acid exploit its bifunctional character, with a polar head group that can be attached to metal cations and a nonpolar chain that confers solubility in organic solvents. The combination leads to uses as a surfactant and softening agent. Stearic acid undergoes the typical reactions of saturated carboxylic acids, a notable one being reduction to stearyl alcohol, and esterification with a range of alcohols. This is used in a large range of manufactures, from simple to complex electronic devices. === Food === Of the saturated fatty acids consumed in the United States, stearic acid consumption is second (26% of total saturated fatty acid intake) to palmitic acid (56% of total saturated fatty acid intake). Stearic acid is more abundant in animal fat (up to 33% in beef liver: 739 ) than in vegetable fat (typically less than 5%). The important exceptions are the foods cocoa butter (34%) and shea butter, where the stearic acid content (as a triglyceride) is 28–45%. Examples of the use of stearic acid in food manufacturing include baked goods, frozen dairy products, gelatins, puddings, hard candy, and nonalcoholic beverages. Stearic acid (E number E570) is found in some foods. === Soaps and cosmetics === Stearic acid is mainly used in the production of detergents, soaps, and cosmetics such as shampoos and shaving cream products. Stearate soap, such as sodium stearate, could be made from stearic acid but instead are usually produced by saponification of stearic acid-containing triglycerides. Esters of stearic acid with ethylene glycol (glycol stearate and glycol distearate) are used to produce a pearly effect in shampoos, soaps, and other cosmetic products. === Lubricants, softening and release agents === In view of the soft texture of the sodium salt, which is the main component of soap, other salts are also useful for their lubricating properties. Lithium stearate is an important component of grease. The stearate salts of zinc, calcium, cadmium, and lead are used as heat stabilizers for PVC. Stearic acid is used along with castor oil for preparing softeners in textile sizing. They are heated and mixed with caustic potash or caustic soda. Related salts are also commonly used as release agents, e.g. in the production of automobile tires. As an example, it can be used to make castings from a plaster piece mold or waste mold, and to make a mold from a shellacked clay original. In this use, powdered stearic acid is mixed in water and the suspension is brushed onto the surface to be parted after casting. This reacts with the calcium in the plaster to form a thin layer of calcium stearate, which functions as a release agent. Steric acid can be converted to zinc stearate, which is used as a lubricant for playing cards (fanning powder) to ensure a smooth motion when fanning. Stearic acid is a common lubricant during injection molding and pressing of ceramic powders. === Niche uses === Being inexpensive, nontoxic, and fairly inert, stearic acid finds many niche applications. Varied examples of stearic acid use in manufacturing include soaps and greases, household soap products, synthetic rubber, cosmetic and pharmaceutical creams and lotions, candles, phonograph records, lubricants, shoe and metal polishes, food packaging, and rubber compounds. Stearic acid is used as a negative plate additive in the manufacture of lead-acid batteries. It is added at the rate of 0.6 g per kg of the oxide while preparing the paste. It is believed to enhance the hydrophobicity of the negative plate, particularly during dry-charging process. It also reduces the extension of oxidation of the freshly formed lead (negative active material) when the plates are kept for drying in the open atmosphere after the process of tank formation. As a consequence, the charging time of a dry uncharged battery during initial filling and charging (IFC) is comparatively lower, as compared to a battery assembled with plates which do not contain stearic acid additive. Fatty acids are classic components of candle-making. Stearic acid is used along with simple sugar or corn syrup as a hardener in candies. == Metabolism == An isotope labeling study in humans concluded that the fraction of dietary stearic acid that oxidatively desaturates to oleic acid is 2.4 times higher than the fraction of palmitic acid analogously converted to palmitoleic acid. Also, stearic acid is less likely to be incorporated into cholesterol esters. In epidemiologic and clinical studies, stearic acid was found to be associated with lowered LDL cholesterol in comparison with other saturated fatty acids. === Examples === Salts Potassium stearate Calcium stearate Cobaltous stearate Lithium stearate Magnesium stearate Mercuric stearate Sodium stearate Zinc stearate Esters Estradiol stearate Glycol stearate Stearin Testosterone stearate == References == == External links == NIST Chemistry WebBook Entry",

         " Isoleucine-proline-proline (Ile-Pro-Pro, IPP) is a natural food source tripeptide that inhibits angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) activity. The aim of this study was to determine the central and peripheral roles of IPP in attenuating sympathetic activity, oxidative stress and hypertension. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to sham-operated surgery (Sham) or two-kidney one-clip (2K1C) surgery to induce renovascular hypertension. Renal sympathetic nerve activity and blood pressure were recorded. Bilateral microinjections of IPP to hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) attenuated sympathetic activity (-16.1 ± 2.5%, P < 0.001) and hypertension (-8.7 ± 1.5 mmHg, P < 0.01) in 2K1C rats by inhibiting ACE activity and subsequent angiotensin II and superoxide production in the PVN. Intravenous injections of IPP also attenuated sympathetic activity (-15.1 ± 2.1%, P < 0.001) and hypertension (-16.8 ± 2.3 mmHg, P < 0.001) via inhibiting ACE activity and oxidative stress in both PVN and arteries of 2K1C rats. The duration of the effects of the intravenous IPP was longer than those of the PVN microinjection, but the sympatho-inhibitory effect of intravenous injections occurred later than that of the PVN microinjection. Intraperitoneal injection of IPP (400 pmol/day for 20 days) attenuated hypertension and vascular remodeling via inhibiting ACE activity and oxidative stress in both PVN and arteries of 2K1C rats. These results indicate that IPP attenuates hypertension and sympathetic activity by inhibiting ACE activity and oxidative stress. The sympathoinhibitory effect of peripheral IPP is mainly caused by the ACE inhibition in PVN, and the antihypertensive effect is related to the sympathoinhibition and the arterial ACE inhibition. Long-term intraperitoneal IPP therapy attenuates hypertension, oxidative stress and vascular remodeling. Much clinical evidence on the antihypertensive effects of the milk-derived antihypertensive peptides Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro (lactotripeptides) has been reported. However, circadian rhythm effects determined by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) to eliminate the confounding influence of the white-coat effect have not been fully studied. Twelve hypertensive patients not receiving antihypertensive medication (2 men, 10 women; mean age±standard deviation, 63.5±8.3 years) who had been visiting our clinic for more than 1 year participated in this study. Mean (±standard deviation) systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were 142.4±2.6 and 83.5±6.4 mm Hg, respectively, at the first office visit. After patients ingested a fermented milk product containing antihypertensive peptides (2.53 mg Val-Pro-Pro; 1.52 mg Ile-Pro-Pro) for more than 4 weeks, both office SBP and DBP were significantly reduced to a mean (±standard deviation) of 133.3±7.0 mm Hg and 76.5±8.4 mm Hg (P<.001 and P<.005 by paired t-test), respectively. The 24-hour SBP and DBP determined by ABPM were reduced from 127.3±2.4 and 78.7±2.3 mm Hg to 120.2±2.4 and 75.0±2.2 mm Hg (P<.001 and P<.05), respectively. Awake-time SBP (08:00-21:00), night-time SBP (0:00-05:00), and early-morning SBP (06:00-07:00) were reduced from 130.9±2.4 to 123.3±2.3 mm Hg, 118.7±2.9 to 113.2±3.4 mm Hg, and 132.8±4.3 to 122.4±3.9 mm Hg (by paired t-test: P<.001, P<.05, and P<.05), respectively. As seen with DBP measured by ABPM, 24-hour DBP and awake-time DBP were significantly reduced from 78.7±2.3 to 75.0±2.2 mm Hg and 82.1±2.5 to 77.3±2.2 mm Hg (P<.05 and P<.01), respectively. Office BP and 24-hour blood pressure did not significantly differ between the dipper and nondipper groups at baseline. However, after treatment, night-time and early-morning blood pressure were significantly reduced from baseline in the nondipper group (-8.5±2.5 and -15.6±3.7 mm Hg; P<.05 and P<.01, respectively) but not in the dipper group (-2.5±3.6 and -1.2±4.7 mm Hg; P not significant), and the reduction in early-morning blood pressure significantly differed between the groups (P<.05). These results suggest that Val-Pro-Pro and Ile-Pro-Pro decrease blood pressure in patients with stage I hypertension and result not only in lower blood pressure at night-time but also in lower early-morning SBP in nondipper patients. Milk casein-derived bioactive tripeptides isoleucine-proline-proline (Ile-Pro-Pro) and valine-proline-proline (Val-Pro-Pro) lower blood pressure in animal models of hypertension and humans. In some studies, their angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitory effect has been demonstrated. Besides classical ACE-angiotensin II-AT(1)-receptor pathway (ACE-Ang II- AT(1)), the significance of ACE2-angiotensin-(1-7)-Mas-receptor (ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas) axis in the blood pressure regulation has now been acknowledged. The present study was aimed to further evaluate the renin-angiotensin system (RAS)-related vascular effects of Ile-Pro-Pro in vitro using rat mesenteric arteries. Superior mesenteric arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) were isolated, cut into rings and mounted in standard organ bath chambers. Endothelium-intact arterial rings were incubated in Krebs solution either with Ile-Pro-Pro, proline-proline (Pro-Pro), isoleucine (Ile), proline (Pro) or captopril for 6h at +37°C and vascular reactivity was measured. In the presence of AT(1)-antagonist valsartan, Ang II induced vasodilatation, which was more pronounced in the arteries incubated with Ile-Pro-Pro (P<0.05) compared to the other compounds. Ang-(1-7)-induced vasodilatation was augmented by Ile-Pro-Pro or Pro (P<0.001 vs. control). Mas-receptor antagonist A-779 did not alter the responses. Ile-Pro-Pro and Pro augmented also bradykinin-induced relaxations (P<0.001 vs. control). Control arteries and arteries incubated with captopril showed only slight relaxations at higher bradykinin concentrations. Casein-derived tripeptide Ile-Pro-Pro and amino acid Pro enhance the vasodilatory effect of Ang-(1-7) and bradykinin. The role of ACE2-Ang-(1-7)-Mas axis in the modulation of vascular tone by these compounds seems probable.",

         "('Quetiapine', 'Seroquel', 'Quetiapine fumarate', 'Norsic', 'Co-quetiapine')",
         "Quetiapine, sold under the brand name Seroquel among others, is an atypical antipsychotic medication used in the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, bipolar depression, and major depressive disorder. Despite being widely prescribed as a sleep aid due to its tranquillizing effects, the benefits of such use may not outweigh the risk of undesirable side effects. It is taken orally. Common side effects include sedation, fatigue, weight gain, constipation, and dry mouth. Other side effects include low blood pressure with standing, seizures, a prolonged erection, high blood sugar, tardive dyskinesia, and neuroleptic malignant syndrome. In older people with dementia, its use increases the risk of death. Use in the third trimester of pregnancy may result in a movement disorder in the baby for some time after birth. Quetiapine is believed to work by blocking a number of receptors, including those for serotonin and dopamine. Quetiapine was developed in 1985 and was approved for medical use in the United States in 1997. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the most prescribed antipsychotic and 82nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 8 million prescriptions. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. The drug is typically indicated to have superior efficacy over other existing antipsychotics for the treatment of bipolar disorder, followed by olanzapine and aripiprazole, in that order. Quetiapine is currently one of only two antipsychotics (the other being cariprazine) that produce equal efficacy as a standalone therapy for mixed manic-depressive mood swings as it is when used in combination with an SSRI antidepressant. However, quetiapine is less potent than clozapine, amisulpride, olanzapine, risperidone, and paliperidone, respectively, in alleviating psychotic symptoms or treating schizophrenia. == Medical uses == Quetiapine is primarily used to treat schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Quetiapine targets both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. === Schizophrenia === A 2013 Cochrane review compared quetiapine to typical antipsychotics: In a 2013 comparison of 15 antipsychotics in effectiveness in treating schizophrenia, quetiapine demonstrated standard effectiveness. It was 13–16% more effective than ziprasidone, chlorpromazine, and asenapine and approximately as effective as haloperidol and aripiprazole. There is tentative evidence of the benefit of quetiapine versus placebo in schizophrenia; however, definitive conclusions are not possible due to the high rate of attrition in trials (greater than 50%) and the lack of data on economic outcomes, social functioning, or quality of life. It is debatable whether, as a class, typical or atypical antipsychotics are more effective. Both have equal drop-out and symptom relapse rates when typicals are used at low to moderate dosages. While quetiapine has lower rates of extrapyramidal side effects, there is greater sleepiness and rates of dry mouth. A Cochrane review comparing quetiapine to other atypical antipsychotic agents tentatively concluded that it may be less efficacious than olanzapine and risperidone; produce fewer movement related side effects than paliperidone, aripiprazole, ziprasidone, risperidone and olanzapine; and produce weight gain similar to risperidone, clozapine and aripiprazole. They concluded that it produces suicide attempt, suicide; death; QTc prolongation, low blood pressure; tachycardia; sedation; gynaecomastia; galactorrhoea, menstrual irregularity and decline in white blood cell count at a rate similar to first generation antipsychotics. === Bipolar disorder === In those with bipolar disorder, quetiapine is used to treat depressive episodes; acute manic episodes associated with bipolar I disorder (as either monotherapy or adjunct therapy to lithium; valproate or lamotrigine); acute mixed episodes; and maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder (as adjunct therapy to lithium or divalproex). === Major depressive disorder === Quetiapine is effective when used by itself and when used along with other medications in major depressive disorder (MDD). However, sedation is often an undesirable side effect. In the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia (while not subsidised by the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for treatment of MDD), quetiapine is licensed for use as an add-on treatment in MDD. === Alzheimer's disease === Quetiapine does not decrease agitation among people with Alzheimer's disease. Quetiapine worsens intellectual functioning in the elderly with dementia and therefore is not recommended. === Insomnia === The use of low doses of quetiapine for insomnia, while common, is not recommended; there is little evidence of benefit and concerns regarding adverse effects. A 2022 network meta-analysis of 154 double-blind, randomized controlled trials of drug therapies vs. placebo for insomnia in adults found that quetiapine did not demonstrate any short-term benefits in sleep quality. Quetiapine, specifically, had an effect size (standardized mean difference) against placebo for treatment of insomnia of 0.05 (95% CITooltip confidence interval –1.21 to 1.11) at 4 weeks of treatment, with the certainty of evidence rated as very low. Doses of quetiapine used for insomnia have ranged from 12.5 to 800 mg, with low doses of 25 to 200 mg being the most typical. Regardless of the dose used, some of the more serious adverse effects may still possibly occur at the lower dosing ranges, such as dyslipidemia and neutropenia. These safety concerns at low doses are corroborated by Danish observational studies that showed use of specifically low-dose quetiapine (prescriptions filled for tablet strengths >50 mg were excluded) was associated with an increased risk of major cardiovascular events as compared to use of Z-drugs, with most of the risk being driven by cardiovascular death. Laboratory data from an unpublished analysis of the same cohort also support the lack of dose-dependency of metabolic side effects, as new use of low-dose quetiapine was associated with a risk of increased fasting triglycerides at 1-year follow-up. === Others === It is sometimes used off-label, often as an augmentation agent, to treat conditions such as Tourette syndrome, musical hallucinations and anxiety disorders. Quetiapine and clozapine are the most widely used medications for the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis due to their relatively low extrapyramidal side-effect liability. Owing to the risks associated with clozapine (e.g. agranulocytosis, diabetes mellitus, etc.), clinicians often attempt treatment with quetiapine first, although the evidence to support quetiapine's use for this indication is significantly weaker than that of clozapine. == Adverse effects == Sources for incidence lists: Very common (>10% incidence) adverse effects Dry mouth Dizziness Headache Somnolence (drowsiness; of 15 antipsychotics quetiapine causes the 5th most sedation. Extended release (XR) formulations tend to produce less sedation, dose-by-dose, than the immediate release formulations.) Common (1–10% incidence) adverse effects Extrapyramidal disease: Quetiapine and clozapine are noted for their relative lack of extrapyramidal side effects. Weight gain: SMD 0.43 kg when compared to placebo. Produces roughly as much weight gain as risperidone, less weight gain than clozapine, olanzapine and zotepine and more weight gain than ziprasidone, lurasidone, aripiprazole and asenapine. As with many other atypical antipsychotics, this action is likely due to its actions at the H1 histamine receptor and 5-HT2C receptor. Rare (<1% incidence) adverse effects Neuroleptic malignant syndrome a rare and potentially fatal complication of antipsychotic drug treatment. It is characterised by the following symptoms: tremor, rigidity, hyperthermia, tachycardia, mental status changes (e.g. confusion), etc. Tardive dyskinesia. A rare and often irreversible neurological condition characterised by involuntary movements of the face, tongue, lips and rest of the body. Most commonly occurs after prolonged treatment with antipsychotics. It is believed to be particularly uncommon with atypical antipsychotics, especially quetiapine and clozapine Both typical and atypical antipsychotics can cause tardive dyskinesia. According to one study, rates are lower with the atypicals at 3.9% as opposed to the typicals at 5.5%. Although quetiapine and clozapine are atypical antipsychotics, switching to these atypicals is an option to minimize symptoms of tardive dyskinesia caused by other atypicals. Weight gain can be a problem for some, with quetiapine causing more weight gain than fluphenazine, haloperidol, loxapine, molindone, olanzapine, pimozide, risperidone, thioridazine, thiothixene, trifluoperazine, and ziprasidone, but less than chlorpromazine, clozapine, perphenazine, and sertindole. As with some other anti-psychotics, quetiapine may lower the seizure threshold, and should be taken with caution in combination with drugs such as bupropion. === Discontinuation === The British National Formulary recommends a gradual withdrawal when discontinuing antipsychotics to avoid acute withdrawal syndrome or rapid relapse. Symptoms of withdrawal commonly include nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Other symptoms may include restlessness, increased sweating, and trouble sleeping. Less commonly there may be a feeling of the world spinning, numbness, or muscle pains. Symptoms generally resolve after a short period of time. There is tentative evidence that discontinuation of antipsychotics can result in psychosis. It may also result in reoccurrence of the condition that is being treated. Rarely tardive dyskinesia can occur when the medication is stopped. === Pregnancy and lactation === Placental exposure is least for quetiapine compared to other atypical antipsychotics. The evidence is insufficient to rule out any risk to the foetus but available data suggests it is unlikely to result in any major foetal malformations. It is secreted in breast milk and hence quetiapine-treated mothers are advised not to breastfeed. === Abuse potential === In contrast to most other antipsychotic drugs, which tend to be somewhat aversive and often show problems with patient compliance with prescribed medication regimes, quetiapine is sometimes associated with drug misuse and abuse potential, for its hypnotic and sedative effects. It has a limited potential for misuse, usually only in individuals with a history of polysubstance abuse and/or mental illness, and especially in those incarcerated in prisons or secure psychiatric facilities where access to alternative intoxicants is more limited. To a significantly greater extent than other atypical antipsychotic drugs, quetiapine was found to be associated with drug-seeking behaviors, and to have standardised street prices and slang terms associated with it, either by itself or in combination with other drugs (such as \"Q-ball\" for the intravenous injection of quetiapine mixed with cocaine). The pharmacological basis for this distinction from other second generation antipsychotic drugs is unclear, though it has been suggested that quetiapine's comparatively lower dopamine receptor affinity and strong antihistamine activity might mean it could be regarded as more similar to sedating antihistamines in this context. While these issues have not been regarded as sufficient cause for placing quetiapine under increased legal controls, prescribers have been urged to show caution when prescribing quetiapine to individuals with characteristics that might place them at increased risk for drug misuse. == Overdose == Most instances of acute overdosage result in only sedation, hypotension and tachycardia, but cardiac arrhythmia, coma and death have occurred in adults. Serum or plasma quetiapine concentrations are usually in the 1–10 mg/L range in overdose survivors, while postmortem blood levels of 10–25 mg/L are generally observed in fatal cases. Non-toxic levels in postmortem blood extend to around 0.8 mg/kg, but toxic levels in postmortem blood can begin at 0.35 mg/kg. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Quetiapine has the following pharmacological actions: Dopamine D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5 receptor antagonist Serotonin 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptor antagonist, and 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT1E, and 5-HT1F receptor ligand α1- and α2-adrenergic receptor antagonist Histamine H1 receptor antagonist Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist This means quetiapine is a dopamine, serotonin, and adrenergic antagonist, and a potent antihistamine with some anticholinergic properties. Quetiapine binds strongly to serotonin receptors; the drug acts as a partial agonist at 5-HT1A receptors and as an antagonist to all other serotonin receptors it has affinity for. Serial PET scans evaluating the D2 receptor occupancy of quetiapine have demonstrated that quetiapine very rapidly disassociates from the D2 receptor. Theoretically, this allows for normal physiological surges of dopamine to elicit normal effects in areas such as the nigrostriatal and tuberoinfundibular pathways, thus minimizing the risk of side-effects such as pseudo-parkinsonism as well as elevations in prolactin. Some of the antagonized receptors (serotonin, norepinephrine) are actually autoreceptors whose blockade tends to increase the release of neurotransmitters. At very low doses, quetiapine acts primarily as a histamine receptor blocker (antihistamine) and α1-adrenergic blocker. When the dose is increased, quetiapine activates the adrenergic system and binds strongly to serotonin receptors and autoreceptors. At high doses, quetiapine starts blocking significant amounts of dopamine receptors. Due to the drug's sedating H1 activity, it is often prescribed at low doses for insomnia. While some feel that low doses of drugs with antihistamine effects like quetiapine and mirtazapine are safer than drugs associated with physical dependency or other risk factors, concern has been raised by some professionals that off-label prescribing has become too widespread due to underappreciated hazards. When treating schizophrenia, antagonism of D2 receptor by quetiapine in the mesolimbic pathway relieves positive symptoms and antagonism of the 5-HT2A receptor in the frontal cortex of the brain may relieve negative symptoms and reduce severity of psychotic episodes. Quetiapine has fewer extrapyramidal side effects and is less likely to cause hyperprolactinemia when compared to other drugs used to treat schizophrenia, so is used as a first line treatment. === Pharmacokinetics === Peak levels of quetiapine occur 1.5 hours after a dose. The plasma protein binding of quetiapine is 83%. The major active metabolite of quetiapine is norquetiapine (N-desalkylquetiapine). Quetiapine has an elimination half-life of 6 or 7 hours. Its metabolite, norquetiapine, has a half-life of 9 to 12 hours. Quetiapine is excreted primarily via the kidneys (73%) and in feces (20%) after hepatic metabolism, the remainder (1%) is excreted as the drug in its unmetabolized form. == Chemistry == Quetiapine is a tetracyclic compound and is closely related structurally to clozapine, olanzapine, loxapine, and other tetracyclic antipsychotics. === Synthesis === The synthesis of quetiapine begins with a dibenzothiazepinone. The lactam is first treated with phosphoryl chloride to produce a dibenzothiazepine. A nucleophilic substitution is used to introduce the sidechain. == History == === Sustained-release === AstraZeneca submitted a new drug application for a sustained-release version of quetiapine in the United States, Canada, and the European Union in the second half of 2006 for treatment of schizophrenia. In May 2007, the US FDA approved Seroquel XR for acute treatment of schizophrenia. During its 2007 Q2 earnings conference, AstraZeneca announced plans to launch Seroquel XR in the U.S. during August 2007. However, Seroquel XR has become available in U.S. pharmacies only after the FDA approved Seroquel XR for use as maintenance treatment for schizophrenia, in addition to acute treatment of the illness, on 16 November 2007. The company has not provided a reason for the delay of Seroquel XR's launch. Health Canada approved sale of Seroquel XR on 27 September 2007. In October 2008, the FDA approved Seroquel XR for the treatment of bipolar depression and bipolar mania. In December 2008, Biovail announced that the FDA had accepted the company's ANDA to market its own version of sustained-release quetiapine. Biovail's sustained-release tablets will compete with AstraZeneca's Seroquel XR. In December 2008, AstraZeneca notified shareholders that the FDA had asked for additional information on the company's application to expand the use of sustained-release quetiapine for treatment of depression. == Society and culture == === Regulatory status === In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved quetiapine for the treatment of schizophrenia and of acute manic episodes associated with bipolar disorder (bipolar mania) and for treatment of bipolar depression. In 2009, quetiapine XR was approved as adjunctive treatment of major depressive disorder. Quetiapine received its initial approval from the US FDA for the treatment of schizophrenia in 1997. In 2004, it received its second indication for the treatment of mania-associated bipolar disorder. In 2007 and 2008, studies were conducted on quetiapine's efficacy in treating generalized anxiety disorder and major depression. Patent protection for the product ended in 2012; however, in a number of regions, the long-acting version remained under patent until 2017. === Lawsuits === In April 2010, the U. S. Department of Justice fined AstraZeneca $520 million for the company's aggressive marketing of Seroquel for off-label uses. According to the Department of Justice, \"the company recruited doctors to serve as authors of articles that were ghostwritten by medical literature companies and about studies the doctors in question did not conduct. AstraZeneca then used those studies and articles as the basis for promotional messages about unapproved uses of Seroquel.\" Multiple lawsuits have been filed in relation to quetiapine's side-effects, in particular, diabetes. Approximately 10,000 lawsuits have been filed against AstraZeneca, alleging that quetiapine caused problems ranging from slurred speech and chronic insomnia to deaths. === Controversy === In 2004, a young man named Dan Markingson committed suicide in a controversial Seroquel clinical trial at the University of Minnesota while under an involuntary commitment order. A group of University of Minnesota bioethicists charged that the trial involved an alarming number of ethical violations. === Nurofen Plus tampering case === In August 2011, the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) issued a class-4 drug alert following reports that some batches of Nurofen plus contained Seroquel XL tablets instead. Following the issue of the Class-4 Drug Alert, Reckitt Benckiser (UK) Ltd received further reports of rogue blister strips in cartons of two additional batches of Nurofen Plus tablets. One of the new batches contained Seroquel XL 50 mg tablets and one contained the Pfizer product Neurontin 100 mg capsules. Following discussions with the MHRA's Defective Medicines Report Centre (DMRC), Reckitt Benckiser (UK) Ltd decided to recall all remaining unexpired stock of Nurofen Plus tablets in any pack size, leading to a Class-1 Drug Alert. The contamination was later traced to in-store tampering by a customer. == References == == External links ==",

         "Raloxifene, sold under the brand name Evista among others, is a medication used to prevent and treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and those on glucocorticoids. For osteoporosis it is less preferred than bisphosphonates. It is also used to reduce the risk of breast cancer in those at high risk. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include hot flashes, leg cramps, swelling, and joint pain. Severe side effects may include blood clots and stroke. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. The medication may worsen menstrual symptoms. Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and therefore a mixed agonist–antagonist of the estrogen receptor (ER). It has estrogenic effects in bone and antiestrogenic effects in the breasts and uterus. Raloxifene was approved for medical use in the United States in 1997. It is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 292nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Raloxifene is used for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. It is used at a dosage of 60 mg/day for both the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. In the case of either osteoporosis prevention or treatment, supplemental calcium and vitamin D should be added to the diet if daily intake is inadequate. Raloxifene is used to reduce the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. It is used at a dosage of 60 mg/day for this indication. In the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene (MORE) clinical trial, raloxifene decreased the risk of all types of breast cancer by 62%, of invasive breast cancer by 72%, and of invasive estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer by 84%. Conversely, it does not reduce the risk of estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer. There were no obvious differences in effectiveness of raloxifene in the MORE trial for prevention of breast cancer at a dosage of 60 mg/m2/day relative to 120 mg/m2/day. In the Study of Tamoxifen and Raloxifene (STAR) trial, 60 mg/day raloxifene was 78% as effective as 20 mg/day tamoxifen in preventing non-invasive breast cancer. Women with undetectable levels of estradiol (<2.7 pg/mL) have a naturally low risk of breast cancer and, in contrast to women with detectable levels of estradiol, do not experience significant benefit from raloxifene in terms of reduction of breast cancer risk. == Contraindications == Raloxifene is contraindicated in lactating women or women who are or who may become pregnant. It also may be of concern to women with active or past history of venous thromboembolic events, including deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, and retinal vein thrombosis. == Side effects == Common side effects of raloxifene include hot flashes (25–28% vs. 18–21% for placebo), vaginal dryness, and leg cramps (generally mild; 5.5% vs. 1.9% for placebo). Raloxifene does not cause breast tenderness, endometrial hyperplasia, menstrual bleeding, or endometrial cancer. It does not appear to affect cognition or memory. Raloxifene is a teratogen; i.e., it can cause developmental abnormalities such as birth defects. Raloxifene may infrequently cause serious blood clots to form in the legs, lungs, or eyes. Other reactions experienced include leg swelling/pain, trouble breathing, chest pain, and vision changes. Black box warnings were added to the label of raloxifene in 2007 warning of increased risk of death due to stroke for postmenopausal women with documented coronary heart disease or at increased risk for major coronary events, as well as increased risk for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. The risk of venous thromboembolism with raloxifene is increased by several-fold in postmenopausal women (RRTooltip relative risk = 3.1). Raloxifene has a lower risk of thromboembolism than tamoxifen. In the MORE trial, raloxifene caused a 40% decrease in risk of cardiovascular events in women who were at increased risk for coronary artery disease, although there was no decrease in cardiovascular events for the group as a whole. A report in September 2009, from Health and Human Services' Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality suggests that tamoxifen and raloxifene used to treat breast cancer, significantly reduce invasive breast cancer in midlife and older women, but also increase the risk of adverse side effects. A human case report in July 2016, suggests that raloxifene may in fact, at some point, also stimulate breast cancer growth leading to a reduction of advanced breast cancer disease upon the withdrawal of the drug. Unlike other SERMs, such as tamoxifen, raloxifene has no risk of uterine hyperplasia or endometrial cancer (RRTooltip relative risk = 0.8). Raloxifene does not increase the incidence of breast pain or tenderness in postmenopausal women. == Overdose == Raloxifene has been studied in clinical trials across a dosage range of 30 to 600 mg/day, and was well-tolerated at all dosages. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === ==== Mechanism of action ==== Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) and hence is a mixed agonist and antagonist of the estrogen receptor (ER) in different tissues. It has estrogenic activity in some tissues, such as bone and the liver, and antiestrogenic activity in other tissues, such as the breasts and uterus. Its affinity (Kd) for the ERα is approximately 50 pM, which is similar to that of estradiol. Relative to estradiol, raloxifene has been reported to possess about 8 to 34% of the affinity for the ERα and 0.5 to 76% of the affinity for the ERβ. Raloxifene acts as a partial agonist of the ERα and as a pure antagonist of the ERβ. In contrast to the classical ERs, raloxifene is an agonist of the G protein-coupled estrogen receptor (GPER) (EC50Tooltip half-maximal effective concentration = 10–100 nM), a membrane estrogen receptor. ==== Clinical effects ==== Raloxifene has antiestrogenic effects in the mammary glands in preclinical studies. In accordance, raloxifene reduces breast density in postmenopausal women, a known risk factor for breast cancer. It does not stimulate the uterus in postmenopausal women, and results in no increase in risk of endometrial thickening, vaginal bleeding, endometrial hyperplasia, or endometrial cancer. At the same time, raloxifene has minimal antiestrogenic effect in the uterus in premenopausal women. This may possibly be due to inadequate tissue exposure of the uterus to raloxifene in these estrogen-rich individuals. In premenopausal women, raloxifene increases levels of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and estradiol. Conversely, in postmenopausal women, raloxifene has been found to reduce levels of the gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and FSH, while not affecting levels of estradiol. Raloxifene also decreases prolactin levels in postmenopausal women. In men, raloxifene has been found to disinhibit the hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal axis (HPG axis) and thereby increase total testosterone levels. Due to the simultaneous increase in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels however, free testosterone levels often remain unchanged in men during therapy with raloxifene. Raloxifene has estrogenic effects on liver protein synthesis. It increases SHBG levels in both pre- and postmenopausal women as well as in men. The medication decreases levels of total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, C-reactive protein, apolipoprotein B, and homocysteine. Conversely, it has little effect on levels of triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Raloxifene has been shown to inhibit the oxidation of LDL cholesterol in vitro. The medication has been found to decrease insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels in pre- and postmenopausal women as well as in men. It has also been found to increase insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) levels in pre- and postmenopausal women. Due to activation of estrogen receptors in the liver, raloxifene has procoagulatory effects, such as decreasing levels of fibrinogen and influencing levels of other coagulation factors. For these reasons, raloxifene increases the risk of thrombosis. Raloxifene increases bone mineral density in postmenopausal women but decreases it in premenopausal women. In the MORE trial, the risk of vertebral fractures was decreased by 30%, and bone mineral density was increased in the spine (by 2.1% at 60 mg, 2.4% at 120 mg) and femoral neck (2.6% at 60 mg, 2.7% at 120 mg). It has been found to possess estrogenic effects in adipose tissue in postmenopausal women, promoting a shift from an android fat distribution to a gynoid fat distribution. The medication has been found to increase levels of leptin, an adipokine. === Pharmacokinetics === ==== Absorption ==== The absorption of raloxifene is approximately 60%. However, due to extensive first-pass metabolism, the absolute bioavailability of raloxifene is only 2.0%. Raloxifene is rapidly absorbed from the intestines upon oral administration. Peak plasma levels of raloxifene occur 0.5 to 6 hours after an oral dose. In healthy postmenopausal women treated with 60 mg/day raloxifene, peak circulating raloxifene levels normalized by dose and body weight were (i.e., divided by (mg/kg)), 0.50 ng/mL (500 pg/mL) after a single dose and 1.36 ng/mL (1,360 pg/mL after multiple doses). ==== Distribution ==== Raloxifene is widely distributed throughout the body. There is extensive distribution of raloxifene into the liver, serum, lungs, and kidneys. The volume of distribution of raloxifene with a single 30 to 150 mg oral dose is approximately 2348 L/kg, which corresponds to ~170,000 L for a 72 kg person. Both raloxifene and its glucuronide metabolites show high plasma protein binding (>95%), including to both albumin and α1 acid glycoprotein, but not to sex hormone-binding globulin. More specifically, raloxifene is 98.2 ± 0.4% bound to plasma proteins. ==== Metabolism ==== Raloxifene is metabolized in the liver and undergoes enterohepatic recycling. It is metabolized exclusively by glucuronidation and is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. Less than 1% of radiolabeled material in plasma comprises unconjugated raloxifene. The metabolites of raloxifene include several glucuronides. The elimination half-life of raloxifene after a single dose is 27.7 hours (1.2 days), whereas its half-life at steady state at a dosage of 60 mg/day is 15.8 to 86.6 hours (0.7–3.6 days), with an average of 32.5 hours (1.4 days). The extended half-life of raloxifene is attributed to enterohepatic recirculation and its high plasma protein binding. Raloxifene and its glucuronide conjugates are interconverted by reversible metabolism and enterohepatic recycling, which prolongs the elimination half-life of raloxifene with oral administration. The medication is deconjugated into its active form in a variety of tissues, including liver, lungs, spleen, bone, uterus, and kidneys. ==== Elimination ==== Raloxifene is mainly excreted in bile and is eliminated in feces. Less than 0.2% of a dose is excreted unchanged in urine and less than 6% of a dose is excreted in urine as glucuronide conjugates. == Chemistry == Raloxifene hydrochloride has the empirical formula C28H27NO4S•HCl, which corresponds to a molecular weight of 510.05 g/mol. Raloxifene hydrochloride is an off-white to pale-yellow solid that is slightly soluble in water. Raloxifene is a benzothiophene derivative and is structurally distinct from the triphenylethylene SERMs like tamoxifen, clomifene, and toremifene. It is the only benzothiophene SERM to have been marketed. A benzothiophene SERM that was not marketed is arzoxifene (LY-353381). Bazedoxifene (Duavee, Viviant) and pipendoxifene (ERA-923) are structurally related to raloxifene but are technically not benzothiophenes and instead are indoles. == History == Raloxifene was approved in the United States for the prevention of postmenopausal osteoporosis in 1997, the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis in 1999, and to prevent or reduce the risk of breast cancer in certain postmenopausal women in 2007. It received orphan designation in 2005. == Society and culture == === Names === Raloxifene is the generic name of the drug and its INNTooltip International Nonproprietary Name and BANTooltip British Approved Name, while raloxifène is its DCFTooltip Dénomination Commune Française and raloxifene hydrochloride is its USANTooltip United States Adopted Name, BANMTooltip British Approved Name, and JANTooltip Japanese Accepted Name. It has also been known by the name keoxifene. Raloxifene is sold mainly under the brand name Evista and to a lesser extent the brand name Optruma. It is also sold under a variety of other brand names in various countries. === Availability === Raloxifene is available widely throughout the world, including in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland, elsewhere throughout Europe, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Latin America, Southern, Eastern, and Southeastern Asia, and elsewhere in the world such as in Israel and Egypt. Raloxifene is provided in the form of 60 mg oral tablets. === Controversy === An editorial in Lancet Oncology criticized the way that research about the medication for breast cancer prevention was released. == Research == Clinical studies of raloxifene for metastatic breast cancer in women have been conducted but found little effectiveness at 60 mg/day in those previously treated with tamoxifen, though modest effectiveness has been observed at higher doses. In contrast to tamoxifen, raloxifene is not approved for the treatment of breast cancer. Raloxifene has been studied in men for a variety of uses, such as for treatment of schizophrenia, prostate cancer, and osteoporosis. It has been studied in combination with castration and bicalutamide, a nonsteroidal antiandrogen, for the treatment of prostate cancer. Raloxifene has been studied as an adjunct in the treatment of schizophrenia in postmenopausal women. A 2017 meta-analysis concluded that it was safe and effective for this indication, although further studies with larger sample sizes are needed for confirmation. It may be effective in women with less severe symptoms. A tissue-selective estrogen-receptor complex (TSEC) of estradiol and raloxifene has been studied in postmenopausal women. Raloxifene (60 mg/day) was reported to be effective in the treatment of pubertal gynecomastia in adolescent boys in a small retrospective chart review. Other SERMs are also known to be effective in the treatment of gynecomastia. Raloxifene has been reported to augment the antidepressant effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). == References == == Further reading ==",

         "Mannitol is a type of sugar alcohol used as a sweetener and medication. It is used as a low calorie sweetener as it is poorly absorbed by the intestines. As a medication, it is used to decrease pressure in the eyes, as in glaucoma, and to lower increased intracranial pressure. Medically, it is given by injection or inhalation. Effects typically begin within 15 minutes and last up to 8 hours. Common side effects from medical use include electrolyte problems and dehydration. Other serious side effects may include worsening heart failure and kidney problems. It is unclear if use is safe in pregnancy. Mannitol is in the osmotic diuretic family of medications and works by pulling fluid from the brain and eyes. The discovery of mannitol is attributed to Joseph Louis Proust in 1806. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It was originally made from the flowering ash and called manna due to its supposed resemblance to the Biblical food. Mannitol is on the World Anti-Doping Agency's banned substances list due to concerns that it may mask prohibited drugs. == Uses == === Medical uses === In the United States, mannitol is indicated for the reduction of intracranial pressure and treatment of cerebral edema and elevated intraocular pressure. In the European Union, mannitol is indicated for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in adults aged 18 years and above as an add-on therapy to best standard of care. Mannitol is used intravenously to reduce acutely raised intracranial pressure until more definitive treatment can be applied, e.g., after head trauma. While mannitol injection is the mainstay for treating high pressure in the skull after a bad brain injury, it is no better than hypertonic saline as a first-line treatment. In treatment-resistant cases, hypertonic saline works better. Intra-arterial infusions of mannitol can transiently open the blood–brain barrier by disrupting tight junctions. It may also be used for certain cases of kidney failure with low urine output, decreasing pressure in the eye, to increase the elimination of certain toxins, and to treat fluid build up. Intraoperative mannitol prior to vessel clamp release during renal transplant has been shown to reduce post-transplant kidney injury, but has not been shown to reduce graft rejection. Mannitol acts as an osmotic laxative in oral doses larger than 20 g, and is sometimes sold as a laxative for children. The use of mannitol, when inhaled, as a bronchial irritant as an alternative method of diagnosis of exercise-induced asthma has been proposed. A 2013 systematic review concluded evidence to support its use for this purpose at this time is insufficient. Mannitol is commonly used in the circuit prime of a heart lung machine during cardiopulmonary bypass. The presence of mannitol preserves renal function during the times of low blood flow and pressure, while the patient is on bypass. The solution prevents the swelling of endothelial cells in the kidney, which may have otherwise reduced blood flow to this area and resulted in cell damage. Mannitol can also be used to temporarily encapsulate a sharp object (such as a helix on a lead for an artificial pacemaker) while it passes through the venous system. Because the mannitol dissolves readily in blood, the sharp point becomes exposed at its destination. Mannitol is also the first drug of choice to treat acute glaucoma in veterinary medicine. It is administered as a 20% solution intravenously. It dehydrates the vitreous humor and, therefore, lowers the intraocular pressure. However, it requires an intact blood-ocular barrier to work. === Food === Mannitol increases blood glucose to a lesser extent than sucrose (thus having a relatively low glycemic index) so is used as a sweetener for people with diabetes, and in chewing gums. Although mannitol has a higher heat of solution than most sugar alcohols, its comparatively low solubility reduces the cooling effect usually found in mint candies and gums. However, when mannitol is completely dissolved in a product, it induces a strong cooling effect. Also, it has a very low hygroscopicity – it does not pick up water from the air until the humidity level is 98%. This makes mannitol very useful as a coating for hard candies, dried fruits, and chewing gums, and it is often included as an ingredient in candies and chewing gum. The pleasant taste and mouthfeel of mannitol also makes it a popular excipient for chewable tablets. === Analytical chemistry === Mannitol can be used to form a complex with boric acid. This increases the acid strength of the boric acid, permitting better precision in volumetric analysis of this acid. === Other === Mannitol is the primary ingredient of mannitol salt agar, a bacterial growth medium, and is used in others. Mannitol is used as a cutting agent in various drugs that are used intranasally (snorted), such as heroin and cocaine. A mixture of mannitol and fentanyl (or fentanyl analogs) in ratio 1:10 is labeled and sold as \"China white\", a popular heroin substitute. Mannitol is a sugar alcohol with \"50-70 percent of the relative sweetness of sugar, which means more must be used to equal the sweetness of sugar. Mannitol lingers in the intestines for a long time and therefore often causes bloating and diarrhea.\" == Contraindications == Mannitol is contraindicated in people with anuria, severe hypovolemia, pre-existing severe pulmonary vascular congestion or pulmonary edema, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and active intracranial bleeding except during craniotomy. Adverse effects include hyponatremia and volume depletion leading to metabolic acidosis. == Chemistry == Mannitol is an isomer of sorbitol, another sugar alcohol; the two differ only in the orientation of the hydroxyl group on carbon 2. While similar, the two sugar alcohols have very different sources in nature, melting points, and uses. == Production == Mannitol is classified as a sugar alcohol; that is, it can be derived from a sugar (mannose) by reduction. Other sugar alcohols include xylitol and sorbitol. === Industrial synthesis === Mannitol is commonly produced via the hydrogenation of fructose, which is formed from either starch or sucrose (common table sugar). Although starch is a cheaper source than sucrose, the transformation of starch is much more complicated. Eventually, it yields a syrup containing about 42% fructose, 52% glucose, and 6% maltose. Sucrose is simply hydrolyzed into an invert sugar syrup, which contains about 50% fructose. In both cases, the syrups are chromatographically purified to contain 90–95% fructose. The fructose is then hydrogenated over a nickel catalyst into a mixture of isomers sorbitol and mannitol. Yield is typically 50%:50%, although slightly alkaline reaction conditions can slightly increase mannitol yields. === Biosyntheses === Mannitol is one of the most abundant energy and carbon storage molecules in nature, produced by a plethora of organisms, including bacteria, yeasts, fungi, algae, lichens, and many plants. Fermentation by microorganisms is an alternative to the traditional industrial synthesis. A fructose to mannitol metabolic pathway, known as the mannitol cycle in fungi, has been discovered in a type of red algae (Caloglossa leprieurii), and it is highly possible that other microorganisms employ similar such pathways. A class of lactic acid bacteria, labeled heterofermentive because of their multiple fermentation pathways, convert either three fructose molecules or two fructose and one glucose molecule into two mannitol molecules, and one molecule each of lactic acid, acetic acid, and carbon dioxide. Feedstock syrups containing medium to large concentrations of fructose (for example, cashew apple juice, containing 55% fructose: 45% glucose) can produce yields 200 g (7.1 oz) mannitol per liter of feedstock. Further research is being conducted, studying ways to engineer even more efficient mannitol pathways in lactic acid bacteria, as well as the use of other microorganisms such as yeast and E. coli in mannitol production. When food-grade strains of any of the aforementioned microorganisms are used, the mannitol and the organism itself are directly applicable to food products, avoiding the need for careful separation of microorganism and mannitol crystals. Although this is a promising method, steps are needed to scale it up to industrially needed quantities. === Natural extraction === Since mannitol is found in a wide variety of natural products, including almost all plants, it can be directly extracted from natural products, rather than chemical or biological syntheses. In fact, in China, isolation from seaweed is the most common form of mannitol production. Mannitol concentrations of plant exudates can range from 20% in seaweeds to 90% in the plane tree. It is a constituent of saw palmetto (Serenoa). Traditionally, mannitol is extracted by the Soxhlet extraction, using ethanol, water, and methanol to steam and then hydrolysis of the crude material. The mannitol is then recrystallized from the extract, generally resulting in yields of about 18% of the original natural product. Another method of extraction is using supercritical and subcritical fluids. These fluids are at such a stage that no difference exists between the liquid and gas stages, so are more diffusive than normal fluids. This is considered to make them much more effective mass transfer agents than normal liquids. The super- or subcritical fluid is pumped through the natural product, and the mostly mannitol product is easily separated from the solvent and minute amount of byproduct. Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction of olive leaves has been shown to require less solvent per measure of leaf than a traditional extraction – 141.7 g (5.00 oz) CO2 versus 194.4 g (6.86 oz) ethanol per 1 g (0.035 oz) olive leaf. Heated, pressurized, subcritical water is even cheaper, and is shown to have dramatically greater results than traditional extraction. It requires only 4.01 g (0.141 oz) water per 1 g (0.035 oz) of olive leaf, and gives a yield of 76.75% mannitol. Both super- and subcritical extractions are cheaper, faster, purer, and more environmentally friendly than the traditional extraction. However, the required high operating temperatures and pressures are causes for hesitancy in the industrial use of this technique. == History == In the early 1880s, Julije Domac elucidated the structure of hexene and mannitol obtained from Caspian manna. He determined the place of the double bond in hexene obtained from mannitol and proved that it is a derivative of a normal hexene. This also solved the structure of mannitol, which was unknown until then. == Controversy == The three studies that originally found high-dose mannitol effective in treating severe head injury were the subject of an investigation. Published in 2007 after the lead author Dr Julio Cruz's death, the investigation questioned whether the studies had actually taken place. The co-authors of the paper were not able to confirm the existence of the study patients, and the Federal University of São Paulo, which Cruz gave as his affiliation, had never employed him. As a result of doubt surrounding Cruz's work, an updated version of the Cochrane review excludes all studies by Julio Cruz, leaving only four studies. Due to differences in selection of control groups, a conclusion about the clinical use of mannitol has not been reached. == Compendial status == British Pharmacopoeia Japanese Pharmacopoeia United States Pharmacopeia == See also == == References == == External links == Media related to Mannitol at Wikimedia Commons",

         "Hippuric acid (Gr. hippos, horse, ouron, urine) is a carboxylic acid and organic compound. It is found in urine and is formed from the combination of benzoic acid and glycine. Levels of hippuric acid rise with the consumption of phenolic compounds (such as in fruit juice, tea and wine). The phenols are first converted to benzoic acid, and then to hippuric acid and excreted in urine. Hippuric acid crystallizes in rhombic prisms which are readily soluble in hot water, melt at 187 °C, and decompose at about 240 °C. High concentrations of hippuric acid may also indicate a toluene intoxication; however, scientists have called this correlation into question because there are other variables that affect levels of hippuric acid. When many aromatic compounds such as benzoic acid and toluene are taken internally, they are converted to hippuric acid by reaction with the amino acid, glycine. == Synthesis == A modern synthesis of hippuric acid involves the acylation of glycine with benzoyl chloride (\"Schotten–Baumann reaction\"). == Physiology == Biochemically, hippuric acid is produced from benzoic acid and glycine, which occurs in the liver, intestine, and kidneys. In terms of mechanism, benzoic acid is converted to benzoyl CoA, an acylating agent. Hippuric acid may be formed from the essential amino acid phenylalanine through at least two pathways. Phenylalanine undergoes biotransformation to form an alpha-keto acid, phenylpyruvic acid, which can tautomerize to a reactive enol. The benzylic carbon is reactive which undergoes peroxidation followed by the competing pathways to either react with the alpha carbon subsequently form an dioxetanol intermediate followed by formation of oxalic acid and benzaldehyde, or, peroxidation can react with the carboxyl group to form an alpha-keto-beta-peroxylactone intermediate followed by formation of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and benzaldehyde. Alternatively, under certain conditions, phenylpyruvic acid may undergo a redox mechanism, such as Iron(II) donating an electron, to directly release carbon dioxide, followed by carbon monoxide, for the formation of a stable toluene radical which is resolved by an antioxidant such as ascorbate. In all of the aforementioned cases, benzaldehyde undergoes biotransformation via CYP450 to benzoic acid followed by conjugation to glycine for formation of hippurate which undergoes urinary excretion. Similarly, toluene reacts with CYP450 to form benzaldehyde. Hippuric acid has been reported to be a marker for Parkinson's disease. == Reactions == Hippuric acid is readily hydrolysed by hot caustic alkalis to benzoic acid and glycine. Nitrous acid converts it into benzoyl glycolic acid, C6H5C(=O)OCH2CO2H. Its ethyl ester reacts with hydrazine to form hippuryl hydrazine, C6H5CONHCH2CONHNH2, which was used by Theodor Curtius for the preparation of hydrazoic acid. Hippuric acid has also been used in Erlenmeyer–Plöchl synthesis of phenylalanine and other amino acids, the reaction proceeding via an oxazolone or \"azlactone\" intermediate. == History == Justus von Liebig showed in 1829 that hippuric acid differed from benzoic acid and he named it, and in 1834 he determined its constitution, while in 1853 French chemist Victor Dessaignes (1800–1885) synthesized it by the action of benzoyl chloride on the zinc salt of glycine. It was also formed by heating benzoic anhydride with glycine, and by heating benzamide with monochloroacetic acid. == See also == para-Aminohippuric acid ortho-Iodohippuric acid Methylhippuric acid (three different isomers) == References ==",

         "('Biotin', 'Vitamin h', 'Vitamin b7', 'Bioepiderm', 'Coenzyme r')",
         "Biotin (also known as vitamin B7 or vitamin H) is one of the B vitamins. It is involved in a wide range of metabolic processes, both in humans and in other organisms, primarily related to the utilization of fats, carbohydrates, and amino acids. The name biotin, borrowed from the German Biotin, derives from the Ancient Greek word βίοτος (bíotos; 'life') and the suffix \"-in\" (a suffix used in chemistry usually to indicate 'forming'). Biotin appears as a white, needle-like crystalline solid. == Chemical description == Biotin is classified as a heterocyclic compound, with a sulfur-containing tetrahydrothiophene ring fused to a ureido group. A C5-carboxylic acid side chain is appended to the former ring. The ureido ring, containing the −N−CO−N− group, serves as the carbon dioxide carrier in carboxylation reactions. Biotin is a coenzyme for five carboxylase enzymes, which are involved in the catabolism of amino acids and fatty acids, synthesis of fatty acids, and gluconeogenesis. Biotinylation of histone proteins in nuclear chromatin plays a role in chromatin stability and gene expression. == Dietary recommendations == The US National Academy of Medicine updated Dietary Reference Intakes for many vitamins in 1998. At that time there was insufficient information to establish estimated average requirement or recommended dietary allowance, terms that exist for most vitamins. In instances such as this, the academy sets adequate intakes (AIs) with the understanding that at some later date, when the physiological effects of biotin are better understood, AIs will be replaced by more exact information. The biotin AIs for both males and females are: Australia and New Zealand set AIs similar to the US. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) also identifies AIs, setting values at 40 μg/day for adults, pregnancy at 40 μg/day, and breastfeeding at 45 μg/day. For children ages 1–17 years, the AIs increase with age from 20 to 35 μg/day. === Safety === The US National Academy of Medicine estimates upper limits for vitamins and minerals when evidence for a true limit is sufficient. For biotin, however, there is no upper limit because the adverse effects of high biotin intake have not been determined. The EFSA also reviewed safety and reached the same conclusion as in the United States. === Labeling regulations === For US food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of daily value. For biotin labeling purposes, 100% of the daily value was 300 μg/day, but as of May 27, 2016, it was revised to 30 μg/day to agree with the adequate intake. Compliance with the updated labeling regulations was required by January 1, 2020, for manufacturers with US$10 million or more in annual food sales, and by January 1, 2021, for manufacturers with lower volume food sales. A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at Reference Daily Intake. == Sources == Biotin is stable at room temperature and is not destroyed by cooking. The dietary biotin intake in Western populations has been estimated to be in the range of 35 to 70 μg/day. Nursing infants ingest about 6 μg/day. Biotin is available in dietary supplements, individually or as an ingredient in multivitamins. According to the Global Fortification Data Exchange, biotin deficiency is so rare that no countries require that foods be fortified. == Physiology == Biotin is a water-soluble B vitamin. Consumption of large amounts as a dietary supplement results in absorption, followed by excretion into urine as biotin. Consumption of biotin as part of a normal diet results in urinary excretion of biotin and biotin metabolites. === Absorption === Biotin in food is bound to proteins. Digestive enzymes reduce the proteins to biotin-bound peptides. The intestinal enzyme biotinidase, found in pancreatic secretions and in the brush border membranes of all three parts of the small intestine, frees biotin, which is then absorbed from the small intestine. When consumed as a biotin dietary supplement, absorption is nonsaturable, meaning that even very high amounts are absorbed effectively. Transport across the jejunum is faster than across the ileum. The large intestine microbiota synthesizes amounts of biotin estimated to be similar to the amount taken in the diet, and a significant portion of this biotin exists in the free (protein-unbound) form and, thus, is available for absorption. How much is absorbed in humans is unknown, although a review did report that human colon epithelial cells in vitro demonstrated an ability to uptake biotin. Once absorbed, sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter (SMVT) mediates biotin uptake into the liver. SMVT also binds pantothenic acid, so high intakes of either of these vitamins can interfere with the transport of the other. === Metabolism and excretion === Biotin catabolism occurs via two pathways. In one, the valeric acid sidechain is cleaved, resulting in bisnorbiotin. In the other path, the sulfur is oxidized, resulting in biotin sulfoxide. Urine content is proportionally about half biotin, plus bisnorbiotin, biotin sulfoxide, and small amounts of other metabolites. === Factors that affect biotin requirements === Chronic alcohol use is associated with a significant reduction in plasma biotin. Intestinal biotin uptake also appears to be sensitive to the effect of the anti-epilepsy drugs carbamazepine and primidone. Relatively low levels of biotin have also been reported in the urine or plasma of patients who have had a partial gastrectomy or have other causes of achlorhydria, as well as burn patients, elderly individuals, and athletes. Pregnancy and lactation may be associated with an increased demand for biotin. In pregnancy, this may be due to a possible acceleration of biotin catabolism, whereas, in lactation, the higher demand has yet to be elucidated. Recent studies have shown marginal biotin deficiency can be present in human gestation, as evidenced by increased urinary excretion of 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid, decreased urinary excretion of biotin and bisnorbiotin, and decreased plasma concentration of biotin. == Biosynthesis == Biotin, synthesized in plants, is essential to plant growth and development. Bacteria also synthesize biotin, and it is thought that bacteria resident in the large intestine may synthesize biotin that is absorbed and utilized by the host organism. Biosynthesis starts from two precursors, alanine and pimeloyl-CoA. These form 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid (KAPA). KAPA is transported from plant peroxisomes to mitochondria where it is converted to 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid (DAPA) with the help of the enzyme, BioA. The enzyme dethiobiotin synthetase catalyzes the formation of the ureido ring via a DAPA carbamate activated with ATP, creating dethiobiotin with the help of the enzyme, BioD, which is then converted into biotin which is catalyzed by BioB. The last step is catalyzed by biotin synthase, a radical SAM enzyme. The sulfur is donated by an unusual [2Fe-2S] ferredoxin. Depending on the species of bacteria, Biotin can be synthesized via multiple pathways. == Cofactor biochemistry == The enzyme holocarboxylase synthetase covalently attaches biotin to five human carboxylase enzymes: Acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha (ACC1) Acetyl-CoA carboxylase beta (ACC2) Pyruvate carboxylase (PC) Methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase (MCC) Propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) For the first two, biotin serves as a cofactor responsible for the transfer of bicarbonate to acetyl-CoA, converting it to malonyl-CoA for fatty acid synthesis. PC participates in gluconeogenesis. MCC catalyzes a step in leucine metabolism. PCC catalyzes a step in the metabolism of propionyl-CoA. Metabolic degradation of the biotinylated carboxylases leads to the formation of biocytin. This compound is further degraded by biotinidase to release biotin, which is then reutilized by holocarboxylase synthetase. Biotinylation of histone proteins in nuclear chromatin is a posttranslational modification that plays a role in chromatin stability and gene expression. == Deficiency == Primary biotin deficiency, meaning deficiency due to too little biotin in the diet, is rare because biotin is contained in many foods. Subclinical deficiency can cause mild symptoms, such as hair thinning, brittle fingernails, or skin rash, typically on the face. Aside from inadequate dietary intake (rare), biotin deficiency can be caused by a genetic disorder that affects biotin metabolism. The most common among these is biotinidase deficiency. Low activity of this enzyme causes a failure to recycle biotin from biocytin. Rarer are carboxylase and biotin transporter deficiencies. Neonatal screening for biotinidase deficiency started in the United States in 1984, with many countries now also testing for this genetic disorder at birth. Treatment is a lifelong dietary supplement with biotin. If biotinidase deficiency goes untreated, it can be fatal. === Diagnosis === Low serum and urine biotin are not sensitive indicators of inadequate biotin intake. However, serum testing can be useful for confirmation of consumption of biotin-containing dietary supplements, and whether a period of refraining from supplement use is long enough to eliminate the potential for interfering with drug tests. Indirect measures depend on the biotin requirement for carboxylases. 3-Methylcrotonyl-CoA is an intermediate step in the catabolism of the amino acid leucine. Without biotin, the pathway diverts to 3-hydroxyisovaleric acid. Urinary excretion of this compound is an early and sensitive indicator of biotin deficiency. === Deficiency as a result of metabolic disorders === Biotinidase deficiency is a deficiency of the enzyme that recycles biotin, due to an inherited genetic mutation. Biotinidase catalyzes the cleavage of biotin from biocytin and biotinyl-peptides (the proteolytic degradation products of each holocarboxylase) and thereby recycles biotin. It is also important in freeing biotin from dietary protein-bound biotin. Neonatal screening for biotinidase deficiency started in the United States in 1984, which as of 2017 was reported as required in more than 30 countries. Profound biotinidase deficiency, defined as less than 10% of normal serum enzyme activity, which has been reported as 7.1 nmol/min/mL, has an incidence of 1 in 40,000 to 1 in 60,000, but with rates as high as 1 in 10,000 in countries with high incidence of consanguineous marriages (second cousin or closer). Partial biotinidase deficiency is defined as 10% to 30% of normal serum activity. Incidence data stems from government-mandated newborn screening. For profound deficiency, treatment is oral dosing with 5 to 20 mg per day. Seizures are reported as resolving in hours to days, with other symptoms resolving within weeks. Treatment of partial biotinidase deficiency is also recommended even though some untreated people never manifest symptoms. Lifelong treatment with supplemental biotin is recommended for both profound and partial biotinidase deficiency. Inherited metabolic disorders characterized by deficient activities of biotin-dependent carboxylases are termed multiple carboxylase deficiency. These include deficiencies in the enzymes holocarboxylase synthetase. Holocarboxylase synthetase deficiency prevents the body's cells from using biotin effectively and thus interferes with multiple carboxylase reactions. There can also be a genetic defect affecting the sodium-dependent multivitamin transporter protein. Biochemical and clinical manifestations of any of these metabolic disorders can include ketolactic acidosis, organic aciduria, hyperammonemia, rash, hypotonia, seizures, developmental delay, alopecia and coma. == Use in biotechnology == Chemically modified versions of biotin are widely used throughout the biotechnology industry to isolate proteins and non-protein compounds for biochemical assays. Because egg-derived avidin binds strongly to biotin with a dissociation constant Kd ≈ 10−15 M, biotinylated compounds of interest can be isolated from a sample by exploiting this highly stable interaction. First, the chemically modified biotin reagents are bound to the targeted compounds in a solution via a process called biotinylation. The choice of which chemical modification to use is responsible for the biotin reagent binding to a specific protein. Second, the sample is incubated with avidin bound to beads, then rinsed, removing all unbound proteins, while leaving only the biotinylated protein bound to avidin. Last, the biotinylated protein can be eluted from the beads with excess free biotin. The process can also utilize bacteria-derived streptavidin bound to beads, but because it has a higher dissociation constant than avidin, very harsh conditions are needed to elute the biotinylated protein from the beads, which often will denature the protein of interest. == Interference with medical laboratory results == When people are ingesting high levels of biotin in dietary supplements, a consequence can be clinically significant interference with diagnostic blood tests that use biotin-streptavidin technology. This methodology is commonly used to measure levels of hormones such as thyroid hormones, and other analytes such as 25-hydroxyvitamin D. Biotin interference can produce both falsely normal and falsely abnormal results. In the US, biotin as a non-prescription dietary supplement is sold in amounts of 1 to 10 mg per serving, with claims for supporting hair and nail health, and as 300 mg per day as a possibly effective treatment for multiple sclerosis (see § Research). Overconsumption of 5 mg/day or higher causes elevated concentration in plasma that interferes with biotin-streptavidin immunoassays in an unpredictable manner. Healthcare professionals are advised to instruct patients to stop taking biotin supplements for 48 h or even up to weeks before the test, depending on the specific test, dose, and frequency of biotin uptake. Guidance for laboratory staff is proposed to detect and manage biotin interference. == History == In 1916, W. G. Bateman observed that a diet high in raw egg whites caused toxic symptoms in dogs, cats, rabbits, and humans. By 1927, scientists such as Margarete Boas and Helen Parsons had performed experiments demonstrating the symptoms associated with \"egg-white injury.\" They had found that rats fed large amounts of egg whites as their only protein source exhibited neurological dysfunction, hair loss, dermatitis, and eventually, death. In 1936, Fritz Kögl and Benno Tönnis documented isolating a yeast growth factor in a journal article titled \"Darstellung von krystallisiertem biotin aus eigelb.\" (Representation of crystallized biotin from egg yolk). The name biotin derives from the Greek word bios ('to live') and the suffix \"-in\" (a general chemical suffix used in organic chemistry). Other research groups, working independently, had isolated the same compound under different names. Hungarian scientist Paul Gyorgy began investigating the factor responsible for egg-white injury in 1933 and in 1939, was successful in identifying what he called \"Vitamin H\" (the H represents Haar und Haut, German for 'hair and skin'). Further chemical characterization of vitamin H revealed that it was water-soluble and present in high amounts in the liver. After experiments performed with yeast and Rhizobium trifolii, West and Wilson isolated a compound they called co-enzyme R. By 1940, it was recognized that all three compounds were identical and were collectively given the name: biotin. Gyorgy continued his work on biotin and in 1941 published a paper demonstrating that egg-white injury was caused by the binding of biotin by avidin. Unlike for many vitamins, there is insufficient information to establish a recommended dietary allowance, so dietary guidelines identify an \"adequate intake\" based on best available science with the understanding that at some later date this will be replaced by more exact information. Using E. coli, a biosynthesis pathway was proposed by Rolfe and Eisenberg in 1968. The initial step was described as a condensation of pimelyl-CoA and alanine to form 7-oxo-8-aminopelargonic acid. From there, they described a three-step process, the last being introducing a sulfur atom to form the tetrahydrothiophene ring. == Research == === Multiple sclerosis === High-dose biotin (300 mg/day = 10,000 times adequate intake) has been used in clinical trials for treatment of multiple sclerosis, a demyelinating autoimmune disease. The hypothesis is that biotin may promote remyelination of the myelin sheath of nerve cells, slowing or even reversing neurodegeneration. The proposed mechanisms are that biotin activates acetyl-CoA carboxylase, a key rate-limiting enzyme during the synthesis of myelin, and by reducing axonal hypoxia through enhanced energy production. Clinical trial results are mixed; a 2019 review concluded that a further investigation of the association between multiple sclerosis symptoms and biotin should be undertaken, whereas two 2020 reviews of a larger number of clinical trials reported no consistent evidence for benefits, and some evidence for increased disease activity and higher risk of relapse. === Hair, nails, skin === In the United States, biotin is promoted as a dietary supplement for strengthening hair and fingernails, though scientific data supporting these outcomes in humans are very weak. A review of the fingernails literature reported brittle nail improvement as evidence from two pre-1990 clinical trials that had administered an oral dietary supplement of 2.5 mg/day for several months, without a placebo control comparison group. There is no more recent clinical trial literature. A review of biotin as a treatment for hair loss identified case studies of infants and young children with genetic defect biotin deficiency having improved hair growth after supplementation, but went on to report that \"there have been no randomized, controlled trials to prove the efficacy of supplementation with biotin in normal, healthy individuals.\" Biotin is also incorporated into topical hair and skin products with similar claims. The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 states that the US Food and Drug Administration must allow on the product label what are described as \"Structure:Function\" (S:F) health claims that ingredient(s) are essential for health. For example: Biotin helps maintain healthy skin, hair, and nails. If a S:F claim is made, the label must include the disclaimer \"This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease.\" == Animals == In cattle, biotin is necessary for hoof health. Lameness due to hoof problems is common, with herd prevalence estimated at 10 to 35%. Consequences of lameness include less food consumption, lower milk production, and increased veterinary treatment costs. Results after 4–6 months from supplementing biotin at 20 mg/day into daily diet reduces the risk of lameness. A review of controlled trials reported that supplementation at 20 mg/day increased milk yield by 4.8%. The discussion speculated that this could be an indirect consequence of improved hoof health or a direct effect on milk production. For horses, conditions such as chronic laminitis, cracked hooves, or dry, brittle feet incapable of holding shoes are a common problem. Biotin is a popular nutritional supplement. There are recommendations that horses need 15 to 25 mg/day. Studies report biotin improves the growth of new hoof horn rather than improving the status of existing hoof, so months of supplementation are needed for the hoof wall to be completely replaced. == See also == Biotin deficiency Biotin sulfoxide Biotinidase deficiency Biotinylation Multiple carboxylase deficiency NeutrAvidin Photobiotin == References == == External links == Media related to Biotin at Wikimedia Commons",

         "Kynurenic acid (KYNA or KYN) is a product of the normal metabolism of amino acid L-tryptophan. It has been shown that kynurenic acid possesses neuroactive activity. It acts as an antiexcitotoxic and anticonvulsant, most likely through acting as an antagonist at excitatory amino acid receptors. Because of this activity, it may influence important neurophysiological and neuropathological processes. As a result, kynurenic acid has been considered for use in therapy in certain neurobiological disorders. Conversely, increased levels of kynurenic acid have also been linked to certain pathological conditions. Kynurenic acid was discovered in 1853 by the German chemist Justus von Liebig in dog urine, which it was apparently named after. It is formed from L-kynurenine in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme kynurenine—oxoglutarate transaminase. == Mechanism of action == KYNA has been proposed to act on five targets: As an antagonist at ionotropic AMPA, NMDA and Kainate glutamate receptors in the concentration range of 0.1-2.5 mM. As a noncompetitive antagonist at the glycine site of the NMDA receptor. As an antagonist of the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. However, recently (2011) direct recording of α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor currents in adult (noncultured) hippocampal interneurons by the Cooper laboratory validated a 2009 study that failed to find any blocking effect of kynurenic acid across a wide range of concentrations, thus suggesting that in noncultured, intact preparations from adult animals there is no effect of kynurenic acid on α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor currents. As a ligand for the orphan G protein-coupled receptor GPR35. As an agonist for the G protein-coupled receptor HCAR3. == Role in disease == High levels of kynurenic acid have been identified in patients with tick-borne encephalitis, schizophrenia and HIV-related illnesses. In all these situations, increased levels were associated with confusion and psychotic symptoms. Kynurenic acid acts in the brain as a glycine-site NMDAr antagonist, key in glutamatergic neurotransmission system, which is thought to be involved in the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of schizophrenia. The kynurenic acid hypothesis of schizophrenia was proposed in 2007, based on its action on midbrain dopamine activity and NMDArs, thus linking dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia with the glutamate hypothesis of the disease. Kynurenic acid is reduced in individuals with mood disorders, such as major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, especially during depressive episodes. High levels of kynurenic acid have been identified in human urine in certain metabolic disorders, such as marked pyridoxine deficiency and deficiency/absence of kynureninase. When researchers decreased the levels of kynurenic acid in the brains of mice, their cognition was shown to improve markedly. However, kynurenic acid also shows neuroprotective properties. Some researchers have posited that the increased levels found in cases of neurological degradation is due to a failed attempt to protect the cells. Elevated levels of kynurenic acid compared to kynurenine appear to be associated with poorer T cell response and higher mortality in male subjects with COVID-19, suggesting an explanation for the poorer clinical outcomes observed in males than in females. == Link to ketogenic diet == One controlled study kept mice on a ketogenic diet and measured kynurenic acid concentrations in different parts of the brain. It found that the mice on the ketogenic diet had greater kynurenic acid concentrations in the striatum and hippocampus compared to mice on a normal diet, with no significant difference in the cortex. In response to the studies showing detrimental behaviour following increases in kynurenic acid the authors also note that the diet was generally well tolerated by the animals, with no \"gross behavioural abnormalities\". They posit that the increases in concentrations found were insufficient to produce behavioural changes seen in those studies. == See also == Xanthurenic acid == References == == External links == Link found between TBE and schizophrenia - TheLocal.se, Sweden's news in English, 6 November 2007.",

         " Gabapentin-lactam (GBP-L) is a transformation product (TP) of gabapentin (GBP), a widely used anti-epileptic pharmaceutical. Due to its high persistence, GBP-L has been frequently detected in the surface water. However, the effects of GBP-L on aquatic organisms have not been thoroughly investigated. In the present study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos as a model organism were used to study the impacts of GBP-L in terms of embryos LC Gabapentin is currently used as a therapeutic agent against epilepsy as well as neuropathic pain. In contrast to gabapentin, its derivative gabapentin-lactam has a pronounced neuroprotective activity. We have studied in cultured hippocampal neurons whether gabapentin-lactam has also neurotrophic effects. Gabapentin-lactam enhanced the formation of dendritic filopodia, which are necessary for synapse formation. It also induced a network of F-actin-containing neurites. In studies with time lapse microscopy, gabapentin-lactam increased the addition but also the elimination of new branches. Affinity precipitation assays showed that gabapentin-lactam increased the GTP binding of the small GTPases Rac and Cdc42, which facilitate branch addition. Gabapentin-lactam also activated RhoA and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases. In neurons transfected with dominant-negative RhoA or treated with the RhoA-inactivating C3 toxin, gabapentin-lactam increased the number of dendrites and branches. In the presence of Y-27632, which inhibits Rho kinase, newly added branches induced by gabapentin-lactam were no longer eliminated so that gabapentin-lactam increased the number of branches. Y-27632 [(+)-(R)-trans-4-(1-aminoethyl)-N-(4-pyridyl) cyclohexanecarboxamide] also prevented the gabapentin-lactam induced activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 [2-(4-morpholinyl)-8-phenyl-1(4H)-benzopyran-4-one hydrochloride] reduced the elimination of newly added branches caused by gabapentin-lactam and thus facilitated branch formation. In contrast to gabapentin-lactam, gabapentin had no effect on dendritic filopodia or motility. The effects exerted by gabapentin-lactam on dendritic arborization may be of potential therapeutic interest.",

         "Quercetin is a plant flavonol from the flavonoid group of polyphenols. It is found in many fruits, vegetables, leaves, seeds, and grains; capers, red onions, and kale are common foods containing appreciable amounts of it. It has a bitter flavor and is used as an ingredient in dietary supplements, beverages, and foods. == Occurrence == Quercetin is a flavonoid widely distributed in nature. The name has been used since 1857, and is derived from quercetum (oak forest), after the oak genus Quercus. It is a naturally occurring polar auxin transport inhibitor. Quercetin is one of the most abundant dietary flavonoids, with an average daily consumption of 25–50 mg. In red onions, higher concentrations of quercetin occur in the outermost rings and in the part closest to the root, the latter being the part of the plant with the highest concentration. One study found that organically grown tomatoes had 79% more quercetin than non-organically grown fruit. Quercetin is present in various kinds of honey from different plant sources. == Biosynthesis == In plants, phenylalanine is converted to 4-coumaroyl-CoA in a series of steps known as the general phenylpropanoid pathway using phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, cinnamate-4-hydroxylase, and 4-coumaroyl-CoA-ligase. One molecule of 4-coumaroyl-CoA is added to three molecules of malonyl-CoA to form tetrahydroxychalcone using 7,2′-dihydroxy-4′-methoxyisoflavanol synthase. Tetrahydroxychalcone is then converted into naringenin using chalcone isomerase. Naringenin is converted into eriodictyol using flavanoid 3′-hydroxylase. Eriodictyol is then converted into dihydroquercetin with flavanone 3-hydroxylase, which is then converted into quercetin using flavonol synthase. === Glycosides === Quercetin is the aglycone form of a number of other flavonoid glycosides, such as rutin (also known as quercetin-3-O-rutinoside) and quercitrin, found in citrus fruit, buckwheat, and onions. Quercetin forms the glycosides quercitrin and rutin together with rhamnose and rutinose, respectively. Likewise guaijaverin is the 3-O-arabinoside, hyperoside is the 3-O-galactoside, isoquercitin is the 3-O-glucoside and spiraeoside is the 4′-O-glucoside. CTN-986 is a quercetin derivative found in cottonseeds and cottonseed oil. Miquelianin is the quercetin 3-O-β-D-glucuronopyranoside. Several taxifolin (also known as dihydroquercetin) glycosides also exist. Isoquercetin is the 3-O-glucoside of quercetin. === Rutin degradation pathway === The enzyme quercitrinase can be found in Aspergillus flavus. This enzyme hydrolyzes the glycoside quercitrin to release quercetin and L-rhamnose. It is an enzyme in the rutin catabolic pathway. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacokinetics === The bioavailability of quercetin in humans after oral intake is very low, with one study concluding it must be less than 1%. Intravenous injection of quercetin shows a rapid decay in concentration described by a two-compartment model (initial half-life of 8.8 minutes, terminal half-life of 2.4 hours). Because it undergoes rapid and extensive metabolism, the biological effects presumed from in vitro studies are unlikely to apply in vivo. Quercetin supplements in the aglycone form are less bioavailable than the quercetin glycoside often found in foods, especially red onions. Ingestion with high-fat foods may increase bioavailability compared to ingestion with low-fat foods, and carbohydrate-rich foods may increase absorption of quercetin by stimulating gastrointestinal motility and colonic fermentation. Whereas quercetin has been shown to be a potent anti-inflammatory compound in a variety of in vitro and in vivo bioassay models, oral quercetin in human subjects has not exhibited the desired effects. Because of low solubility and poor bioavailability of quercetin, derivatives have been synthesized to overcome these challenges and enhance its biological activity, leading to compounds with improved properties for possible therapeutic applications. === Metabolism === Quercetin is rapidly metabolized (via glucuronidation) after the ingestion of quercetin foods or supplements. Five metabolites (quercetin glucuronides) have been found in human plasma after quercetin ingestion. Taken together, the quercetin glucuronides have a half-life around 11–12 hours. In rats, quercetin did not undergo any significant phase I metabolism. In contrast, quercetin did undergo extensive phase II (conjugation) to produce metabolites that are more polar than the parent substance, hence are more rapidly excreted from the body. In vitro, the meta-hydroxyl group of catechol is methylated by catechol-O-methyltransferase. Four of the five hydroxyl groups of quercetin are glucuronidated by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase. The exception is the 5-hydroxyl group of the flavonoid ring, which generally does not undergo glucuronidation. The major metabolites of orally absorbed quercetin are quercetin-3-glucuronide, 3'-methylquercetin-3-glucuronide, and quercetin-3'-sulfate. A methyl metabolite of quercetin has been shown in vitro to be more effective than quercetin at inhibiting lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages. Compared to other flavonoids, quercetin is one of the most effective inducers of the phase II detoxification enzymes. In vitro studies show that quercetin is a strong inhibitor of the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 and a moderate inhibitor of CYP2D6. Drugs that are metabolized by these pathways may have increased effect. An in vivo study found that quercetin supplementation slows the metabolism of caffeine to a statistically significant extent in a particular genetic subpopulation, but in absolute terms the effect was almost negligible. == Food safety == In 2010, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration acknowledged high-purity quercetin as generally recognized as safe for use as an ingredient in various specified food categories at levels up to 500 mg per serving. == Health claims == Quercetin has been studied in basic research and small clinical trials. While supplements have been promoted for the treatment of cancer and various other diseases, there is no high-quality evidence that quercetin (via supplements or in food) is useful to treat cancer or any other disease. The US Food and Drug Administration has issued warning letters to several manufacturers advertising on their product labels and websites that quercetin product(s) can be used to treat diseases. The FDA regards such quercetin advertising and products as unapproved – with unauthorized health claims concerning the anti-disease products – as defined by \"sections 201(g)(1)(B) and/or 201 (g)(1)(C) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(B) and/or 21 U.S.C. § 321(g)(1)(C)] because they are intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease\", conditions not met by the manufacturers. === Safety === Little research has been conducted into the safety of quercetin supplementation in humans, and the results are insufficient to give confidence that the practice is safe. In particular, a lack of safety information exists on the effect of quercetin supplementation for pregnant women, breastfeeding women, children, and adolescents. The hormonal effects of quercetin found in animal studies raise the suspicion of a parallel effect in humans, particularly in respect of estrogen-dependent tumors. Quercetin supplementation can interfere with the effects of medications. The precise nature of this interaction is known for some common medicines, but for many, it is not. == See also == == References == == External links == Media related to Quercetin at Wikimedia Commons",

         "Vinpocetine (ethyl apovincaminate), sold under the brand name Cavinton among others, is a synthetic derivative of the vinca alkaloid vincamine, differing by the removal of a hydroxyl group and by being the ethyl rather than the methyl ester of the underlying carboxylic acid. Vincamine is extracted from either the seeds of Voacanga africana or the leaves of Vinca minor (lesser periwinkle). == Medical uses == Vinpocetine has been used in many Asian and European countries for treatment of cerebrovascular disorders such as stroke and dementia for over three decades. The FDA has tentatively ruled that vinpocetine, due to its synthetic nature and proposed therapeutic uses, is ineligible to be marketed as dietary supplement under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Despite this, vinpocetine remains widely available in dietary supplements often marketed as nootropics. Vinpocetine does not fully support a benefit in either dementia or stroke. As of 2003, three controlled clinical trials had tested \"older adults with memory problems\". Vinpocetine has also been studied for the prevention and recovery of acquired hearing loss in a phase II, longitudinal and prospective open clinical study on humans. == Side effects == Use during pregnancy may harm the baby or result in miscarriage. Adverse effects of vinpocetine include flushing, nausea, dizziness, dry mouth, transient hypo- and hyper-tension, headaches, heartburn, and decreased blood pressure. FDA issued a statement in 2019 warning that \"vinpocetine may cause a miscarriage or harm fetal development\". == Mechanism of action == Vinpocetine’s mechanism of action has been postulated to involve three potential effects: blockage of sodium channels, reduction of cellular calcium influx, and antioxidant activity. Studies have also suggested that vinpocetine can inhibit PDE-1 in isolated rabbit aorta; inhibit IKK in vitro, preventing IκB degradation and the following translocation of NF-κB to the cell nucleus; and increase DOPAC, a metabolic breakdown product of dopamine, in isolated striatal nerve endings of rats. == Dietary supplement == The inclusion of vinpocetine in dietary supplements in the U.S. has come under scrutiny due to the lack of defined dosage parameters, unproven short- and long-term benefits, and risks to human health. In the U.S., vinpocetine supplements are marketed as sports supplements, brain enhancers, and weight loss supplements. A 2015 analysis of 23 brands of vinpocetine dietary supplements sold at GNC and Vitamin Shoppe retail stores reported widespread labeling errors. Only 6 of the 23 supplement labels (26%) provided consumers with accurate dosages of vinpocetine (ranging from 0.3 to 32 mg per recommended daily serving), while 6 of 23 (26%) contained no vinpocetine at all, despite their labels claiming that the ingredient was in them. In total, 9 of the 23 products tested were mislabeled, and 17 of 23 (74%) did not provide any information on the quantity of vinpocetine. In response to the study, then-senator Claire McCaskill, while at the time serving as the top Democrat on the Senate Special Committee on Aging, urged the FDA to suspend sales of vinpocetine supplements and asked 10 retailers to voluntarily stop selling vinpocetine products. McCaskill stated: \"The way we regulate these supplements isn’t working—and it’s putting the lives and well-being of consumers at risk. We’ve seen products with false labels, tainted ingredients, wildly illegal claims, and, now, products containing synthesized ingredients that are classified as prescription drugs in other countries.\" === Lawsuits === Procera AVH is a dietary supplement containing undisclosed amounts of vinpocetine in combination with huperzine A and acetyl-l-carnitine. In 2012, manufacturer Brain Research Labs (BRL) agreed to pay $500,000 to settle a class action lawsuit which alleged that the company had falsely marketed Procera AVH as capable of improving brain function, in violation of the Consumer Fraud Act. In July 2015, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) ruled that marketing claims for Procera AVH, which promoted the product as a “solution” to memory loss and cognitive decline, were false, misleading, unsubstantiated, and in violation of the FTC Act. BRL and its affiliated companies Brain Power Partners, Brain Power Founders, and MedHealth Direct (all based in Laguna Beach, California) were fined $91 million. KeyView Labs, the Tampa, Florida-based company that purchased BRL in 2012, was fined $61 million. Also named in the FTC complaint were George Reynolds (aka Josh Reynolds), founder and chief science officer of BRL, and John Arnold, the sole officer and employee of MedHealth. The FTC complaint charged Reynolds with making deceptive expert endorsements for Procera AVH. The defendants in the case ultimately agreed to pay $1.4 million to settle the allegations of deceptive advertising brought by the FTC and California law enforcement officials. In addition, a permanent injunction barred the defendants from making similar deceptive claims about Procera AVH in the future and from misrepresenting the existence, results, or conclusions of any scientific study. == References ==",

         " Gait speed is an important measure of lower extremity physical performance in older adults and is predictive of disability and mortality. The biological pathways involved in the decline of lower extremity physical performance are not well understood. We used a targeted metabolomics approach to identify plasma metabolites predictive of change in gait speed over time. Gait speed was measured at baseline and over median follow-up of 50.5 months in 504 adults, aged ≥50 years, who had two or more study visits in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). Plasma metabolites were measured using targeted mass spectrometry (AbsoluteIDQ p180 Kit, Biocrates). Of 148 plasma metabolites (amino acids, biogenic amines, hexoses, glycerophospholipids) measured, eight were significantly associated with gait speed at baseline, independent of age and sex: hexoses (r = -0.148, p < .001), [sphingomyelin (SM) 16:1 (r = -0.091, p = .0009), SM 18:0 (r = -0.085, p = .002), SM 18:1 (r = -0.128, p < .0001], phosphatidylcholine aa 32:3 (r = -0.088, p = .001), lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) 17:0 (r = 0.083, p = .003), LPC 18:1 (r = 0.089, p = .001), and LPC 18:2 (r = 0.104, p < .0001). Adjusting for baseline age, sex, and chronic diseases, baseline plasma LPC 18:2 was an independent predictor of the rate of change of gait speed over subsequent follow-up (p = .003). No other plasma metabolites were significantly associated longitudinal changes of gait speed over time. Low plasma LPC 18:2, which has previously been shown to predict impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, coronary artery disease, and memory impairment, is an independent predictor of decline in gait speed in older adults.",

         "('Lovastatin', 'Mevinolin', 'Lovalip', 'Mevacor', 'Altoprev')",
         "Lovastatin, sold under the brand name Mevacor among others, is a statin medication, to treat high blood cholesterol and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Its use is recommended together with lifestyle changes. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include diarrhea, constipation, headache, muscles pains, rash, and trouble sleeping. Serious side effects may include liver problems, muscle breakdown, and kidney failure. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby and use during breastfeeding is not recommended. It works by decreasing the liver's ability to produce cholesterol by blocking the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. Lovastatin was patented in 1979 and approved for medical use in 1987. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 111th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 5 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == The primary uses of lovastatin is for the treatment of dyslipidemia and the prevention of cardiovascular disease. It is recommended to be used only after other measures, such as diet, exercise, and weight reduction, have not improved cholesterol levels. == Side effects == Lovastatin is usually well tolerated, with the most common side effects being, in approximately descending order of frequency: creatine phosphokinase elevation, flatulence, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhoea, muscle aches or pains, nausea, indigestion, weakness, blurred vision, rash, dizziness and muscle cramps. As with all statin drugs, it can occasionally cause myopathy, hepatotoxicity (liver damage), dermatomyositis or rhabdomyolysis. This can be life-threatening if not recognised and treated in time, so any unexplained muscle pain or weakness whilst on lovastatin should be promptly mentioned to the prescribing doctor. Other uncommon side effects that should be promptly mentioned to either the prescribing doctor or an emergency medical service include: These less serious side effects should still be reported if they persist or increase in severity: === Contraindications === Contraindications, conditions that warrant withholding treatment with lovastatin, include pregnancy, breast feeding, and liver disease. Lovastatin is contraindicated during pregnancy (Pregnancy Category X); it may cause birth defects such as skeletal deformities or learning disabilities. Owing to its potential to disrupt infant lipid metabolism, lovastatin should not be taken while breastfeeding. Patients with liver disease should not take lovastatin. == Interactions == As with atorvastatin, simvastatin, and other statin drugs metabolized via CYP3A4, drinking grapefruit juice during lovastatin therapy may increase the risk of side effects. Components of grapefruit juice, the flavonoid naringin, or the furanocoumarin bergamottin inhibit CYP3A4 in vitro, and may account for the in vivo effect of grapefruit juice concentrate decreasing the metabolic clearance of lovastatin, and increasing its plasma concentrations. == Mechanism of action == Lovastatin is an inhibitor of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate. Mevalonate is a required building block for cholesterol biosynthesis and lovastatin interferes with its production by acting as a reversible competitive inhibitor for HMG-CoA, which binds to the HMG-CoA reductase. Lovastatin is a prodrug, an inactive lactone in its native form, the gamma-lactone closed ring form in which it is administered, is hydrolysed in vivo to the β-hydroxy acid open ring form; which is the active form. Lovastatin and other statins have been studied for their chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic effects. No such effects were seen in the early studies. More recent investigations revealed some chemopreventive and therapeutic effects, for certain types of cancer, especially in combination of statins with other anticancer drugs. It is likely that these effect are mediated by the properties of statins to reduce proteasome activity, leading to an accumulation of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21 and p27, and to subsequent G1-phase arrest, as seen in cells of different cancer lines. == History == Compactin and lovastatin, natural products with a powerful inhibitory effect on HMG-CoA reductase, were discovered in the 1970s, and taken into clinical development as potential drugs for lowering LDL cholesterol. In 1982, some small-scale clinical investigations of lovastatin, a polyketide-derived natural product isolated from Aspergillus terreus, in very high-risk patients were undertaken, in which dramatic reductions in LDL cholesterol were observed, with very few adverse effects. After the additional animal safety studies with lovastatin revealed no toxicity of the type thought to be associated with compactin, clinical studies continued. Large-scale trials confirmed the effectiveness of lovastatin. Observed tolerability continued to be excellent, and lovastatin was approved by the US FDA in 1987. It was the first statin approved by the FDA. Lovastatin is also naturally produced by certain higher fungi, such as Pleurotus ostreatus (oyster mushroom) and closely related Pleurotus spp. Research into the effect of oyster mushroom and its extracts on the cholesterol levels of laboratory animals has been extensive, although the effect has been demonstrated in a very limited number of human subjects. In 1998, the FDA placed a ban on the sale of dietary supplements derived from red yeast rice, which naturally contains lovastatin, arguing that products containing prescription agents require drug approval. Judge Dale A. Kimball of the United States District Court for the District of Utah, granted a motion by Cholestin's manufacturer, Pharmanex, that the agency's ban was illegal under the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act because the product was marketed as a dietary supplement, not a drug. The objective is to decrease excess levels of cholesterol to an amount consistent with maintenance of normal body function. Cholesterol is biosynthesized in a series of more than 25 separate enzymatic reactions that initially involves three successive condensations of acetyl-CoA units to form the six-carbon compound 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG CoA). This is reduced to mevalonate and then converted in a series of reactions to the isoprenes that are building-blocks of squalene, the immediate precursor to sterols, which cyclizes to lanosterol (a methylated sterol) and further metabolized to cholesterol. A number of early attempts to block the synthesis of cholesterol resulted in agents that inhibited late in the biosynthetic pathway between lanosterol and cholesterol. A major rate-limiting step in the pathway is at the level of the microsomal enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of HMG CoA to mevalonic acid, and that has been considered to be a prime target for pharmacologic intervention for several years. HMG CoA reductase occurs early in the biosynthetic pathway and is among the first committed steps to cholesterol formulation. Inhibition of this enzyme could lead to accumulation of HMG CoA, a water-soluble intermediate that is, then, capable of being readily metabolized to simpler molecules. This inhibition of reductase would lead to accumulation of lipophylic intermediates with a formal sterol ring. Lovastatin was the first specific inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase to receive approval for the treatment of hypercholesterolemia. The first breakthrough in efforts to find a potent, specific, competitive inhibitor of HMG CoA reductase occurred in 1976, when Endo et al. reported the discovery of mevastatin, a highly functionalized fungal metabolite, isolated from cultures of Penicillium citrium. === Biosynthesis === The biosynthesis of lovastatin occurs via an iterative type I polyketide synthase (PKS) pathway. The six genes that encode enzymes that are essential for the biosynthesis of lovastatin are lovB, lovC, lovA, lovD, lovG, and lovF . The synthesis of dihydromonacolin L requires a total of 9-malonyl Coa . It proceeds in the PKS pathway until it reaches (E) a hexaketide, where it undergoes a Diels-Alder cycloaddition to form the fused rings. After cyclization it continues through the PKS pathway until it reaches (I) a nonaketide, which then undergoes release from LovB through the thioesterase encoded by LovG. Dihydromonacolin L, (J), then undergoes oxidation and dehydration via a cytochrome P450 oxygenase encoded by LovA to obtain monacolin J, (L). The MT domain from lovB is active in the conversion of (B) to (C) when it transfers a methyl group from S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) to the tetraketide (C) . Because LovB contains an inactive ER domain, LovC is required at specific steps to obtain fully reduced products. The domain organization of LovB, LovC, LovG and LovF is shown in Figure 2. The inactive ER domain of lovB is shown with an oval and where LovC acts in trans to LovB is shown with a red box. In a parallel pathway, the diketide side chain of lovastatin is synthesized by another highly reducing type I polyketide synthase enzyme encoded by LovF . Lastly, the side chain, 2-methylbutyrate (M) is covalently attached to C-8 hydroxy group of monacolin J (L) by a transesterase encoded by LovD to form lovastatin. === Total synthesis === A major bulk of work in the synthesis of lovastatin was done by M. Hirama in the 1980s. Hirama synthesized compactin and used one of the intermediates to follow a different path to get to lovastatin. The synthetic sequence is shown in the schemes below. The γ-lactone was synthesized using Yamada methodology starting with glutamic acid. Lactone opening was done using lithium methoxide in methanol and then silylation to give a separable mixture of the starting lactone and the silyl ether. The silyl ether on hydrogenolysis followed by Collins oxidation gave the aldehyde. Stereoselective preparation of (E,E)-diene was accomplished by addition of trans-crotyl phenyl sulfone anion, followed by quenching with Ac2O and subsequent reductive elimination of sulfone acetate. Condensation of this with lithium anion of dimethyl methylphosphonate gave compound 1. Compound 2 was synthesized as shown in the scheme in the synthetic procedure. Compounds 1 and 2 were then combined using 1.3 eq sodium hydride in THF followed by reflux in chlorobenzene for 82 hr under nitrogen to get the enone 3. Simple organic reactions were used to get to lovastatin as shown in the scheme. == Society and culture == === Natural sources === Lovastatin is a naturally occurring compound found in low concentrations in food such as oyster mushrooms, red yeast rice, and Pu-erh. === Brand names === Mevacor, Advicor (as a combination with niacin), Altocor, Altoprev === Other applications === In plant physiology, lovastatin has occasionally been used as inhibitor of cytokinin biosynthesis. == References ==",

         " Ischemic stroke (IS) is a life-threatening neurological disease with various pathological mechanisms. Tetrahydropiperine (THP) is a natural alkaloid with protective effects against multiple diseases, such as seizure, and pain. This study was to examine the impact of THP on IS and investigate its potential mechanism. We employed network pharmacology and molecular docking techniques to identify the target proteins of THP for intervention in IS. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were used to create a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion model. PC-12 cells were chosen to establish an oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) cell model. Disease modeling followed by nimodipine (NIMO); 3-methyladenine (3-MA) and rapamycin (RAP) interventions. Open field test, Longa score, balance beam test, and forelimb grip test were used to measure motor and neurological functions. The degree of neurological damage recovery was assessed through behavioral analysis, and cerebral infarction volume was determined using TTC staining. Morphological changes were examined through HE and Nissl staining, and ultrastructural changes in neurons were observed using transmission electron microscopy. The protein expression of autophagy and related pathways was analyzed through Western blot (WB). The appropriate hypoxia time and drug concentration were determined using CCK-8 assay, which also measured cell survival rate. The network pharmacology findings indicated that the impact of THP on IS was enhanced in the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. THP demonstrated robust docking capability with proteins associated with the autophagy and PI3K/Akt/mTOR, as indicated by the molecular docking outcomes. THP significantly improved behavioral damage, reduced the area of cerebral infarction, ameliorated histopathological damage from ischemia, increase neuronal survival, and alleviated ultrastructural damage in neurons (P < 0.05). THP enhanced the survival of PC-12 cells induced by OGD and ameliorated the morphological harm to the cells (P < 0.05). THP was found to elevate the quantities of P62, LC3-Ⅰ, PI3K, P-AKt/Akt, and P-mTOR/mTOR proteins while reducing the levels of Atg7 and Beclin1 proteins. The results of transmission electron microscopy showed no autophagosomes in the THP, 3-MA, and 3-MA + THP groups. The activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway by THP inhibits autophagy and provides relief from neurological damage in IS. The present study describes the synthesis, characterization, and evaluation of tetrahydropiperine (THP), piperic acid (PA), and tetrahydropiperic acid (THPA) as anti-inflammatory agents. THPA demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory activity among all the compounds. The anti-inflammatory potential was investigated in both in-vitro and in-vivo experimental models. Our findings demonstrated that THPA effectively suppressed the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including nitric oxide and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) in both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, THPA attenuated the expression of i-NOS and COX-2 in RAW 264.7 macrophages. The oral administration of THPA significantly reduced carrageenan induced paw edema thickness and alleviated liver, lung, and kidney injury induced by LPS. THPA also reduced the infiltration of inflammatory cells, prevented the occurrence of significant lesions, and mitigated tissue damage. Moreover, THPA significantly improved the survival rate of mice challenged with LPS. Our western blot studies also found that LPS induced NF-κB activation was downregulated by treatment with THPA in an in vivo system. These results collectively illustrated the potential of THPA as a therapeutic agent for treating inflammatory diseases. Tetrahydropiperine is one of the natural arylpentanamide compounds isolated from Piper nigrum L., which has been demonstrated to have insecticidal activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the metabolic profiles of tetrahydropiperine in mouse, rat, dog, monkey and human hepatocytes. The in vitro metabolism of tetrahydropiperine was elucidated via incubation with hepatocytes for 2 h at 37°C. The samples were analyzed using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography combined with diode-array detection and high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry operated in positive electrospray ionization mode. The structures of the metabolites were characterized using their retention times and their tandem mass spectrometric product ions. A total of 20 metabolites were detected and their structures were proposed. These metabolites were formed mainly through the following pathways: (1) 1,3-benzodioxole ring opening to form a catechol derivative (M12), which was prone to glucuronidation (M6 and M8), methylation (M17) and glutathione (GSH)-derived conjugation through an ortho-quinone intermediate (M4) or via an aldehyde intermediate (M7); (2) dehydrogenation to form a piperanine (M15), which was subsequently subject to hydroxylation (M2 and M5) and GSH conjugation (M10 and M11) via Michael addition; (3) hydroxylation (M13, M14, M16, M18 and M19); and (4) direct GSH conjugation through an aldehyde intermediate (M3). The major metabolic pathways of tetrahydropiperine were hydroxylation, dehydrogenation, methylation, GSH conjugation and glucuronidation. Tetrahydropiperine was bioactivated through ortho-quinone, Michael receptor and aldehyde intermediates.",

Piperyline (PIPE) is a further amide alkaloid that has been isolated from P. nigrum. This study was performed to examine the biological effects of PIPE on pre-osteoblasts and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. We investigated the effects of PIPE in MC3T3E-1 cells, which are widely used for studying osteoblast behavior in in vitro cell systems. We evaluated cell viability based on the MTT assay, apoptosis by TUNEL staining, adhesion and migration by cell adhesion and migration assays, and osteoblast differentiation by alkaline phosphatase activity and staining. Western blot and immunocytochemical analyses were used to investigate cell signaling pathways. We found that at concentrations ranging from 1 to 30 μM, PIPE inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in pre-osteoblasts, which was accompanied by the upregulation of apoptotic proteins but downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins. In contrast, PIPE had no appreciable effect on the autophagy pathway. Nevertheless, PIPE reduced cell adhesion and migration via the inactivation of non-receptor tyrosine kinase (Src)/focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and mitogen-activated protein kinases, and also promoted the downregulation of matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 levels. Furthermore, at concentrations of 10 and 30 μM, PIPE suppressed osteoblast differentiation, as indicated by reductions in alkaline phosphatase staining and activity. In addition, PIPE reduced the protein levels of phospho-Smad1/5/8 and runt-related transcription factor 2, and the mRNA levels of osteopontin, alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin. The findings of this study indicate that PIPE has biological effects associated with cell adhesion, migration, proliferation, and osteoblast differentiation, and suggest a potential role for this alkaloid in the treatment of bone diseases.",

This was through manipulation of the metabolism and excretion, and is seen that fifty percent of the drug is hepatobiliary cleared, which can compensate for diminished renal clearance. The remaining fifty percent is excreted in urine. It does not need dose adjustment. It was patented in 1980 and approved for medical use in 1991. == Medical uses == In congestive heart failure, the ability of the heart to pump enough blood to satisfy the physiological needs of the body is reduced. This condition has a variety of causes, including damaged heart valves, myocardial infarction, hypertension, vitamin B1 deficiency, and genetic mutations. When subsequent blood flow to the kidneys is reduced, the kidneys respond by increasing the secretion of renin from the juxtaglomerular apparatus. Renin converts the inactive angiotensinogen into angiotensin I, which is converted to angiotensin II (AII) by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE). AII can have negative effects on the cardiovascular system after events such as heart failure and myocardial infarction. AII causes arterial vasoconstriction and hypertension, resulting in an increase in afterload, increasing the resistance against which the heart works. Additionally, chronic increase in production of AII is associated with structural changes to the myocardium which reduces the functionality of the heart. In heart failure patients, fosinopril increases exercise tolerance and lowers the frequency of events associated with worsening heart failure, such as dyspnea, the need for supplemental diuretics, fatigue, and hospitalizations. == Chemistry == Unlike other ACE inhibitors that are primarily excreted by the kidneys, fosinopril is eliminated from the body by both renal and hepatic pathways. This characteristic of fosinopril makes the drug a safer choice than other ACE inhibitors for heart failure patients with impaired kidney function resulting from poor perfusion as fosinopril can still be eliminated by the liver, preventing accumulation of the drug in the body. Fosinopril is de-esterified by the liver or gastrointestinal mucosa and is converted to its active form, fosinoprilat. Fosinoprilat competitively binds to ACE, preventing ACE from binding to and converting angiotensin I to angiotensin II. Inhibiting the production of AII lowers peripheral vascular resistance, decreases afterload, and decreases blood pressure, thus helping to alleviate the negative effects of AII on cardiac performance. == References ==",

         " Recently, tea (Camellia sinensis) flowers have attracted increasing interest because of their content of bioactive compounds such as catechins. The aim of this study was to investigate the occurrence of some characteristic compounds in tea flowers. A principal component analysis of metabolites using ultra-performance liquid chromatography/time-of-flight mass spectrometry showed differences in metabolite profile between flowers and leaves of C. sinensis var. Yabukita. Four spermidine derivatives were isolated from tea flowers. One of them was determined as N(1) ,N(5) ,N(10) -tricoumaroyl spermidine based on NMR, MS and UV data. The other three were identified as feruoyl dicoumaroyl spermidine, coumaroyl diferuoyl spermidine and triferuoyl spermidine based on MS(n) data. Tricoumaroyl spermidine as the major spermidine conjugate was not detected in tea leaves. Furthermore, it decreased during floral development and mainly occurred in anthers. This study has provided the first evidence that spermidine-phenolic acid conjugates occur in tea flowers in considerable amounts. Their presence should prompt a reconsideration of the ecological role of tea flowers. From an economic point of view, tea flowers might be suitable as a raw material in the healthcare food and pharmaceutical industries. Hydroxycinnamic acid amides are a class of secondary metabolites distributed widely in plants. We have identified two sinapoyl spermidine derivatives, N-((4'-O-glycosyl)-sinapoyl),N'-sinapoylspermidine and N,N'-disinapoylspermidine, which comprise the two major polyamine conjugates that accumulate in Arabidopsis thaliana seed. Using metabolic profiling of knockout mutants to elucidate the functions of members of the BAHD acyltransferase family in Arabidopsis, we have also identified two genes encoding spermidine disinapoyl transferase (SDT) and spermidine dicoumaroyl transferase (SCT) activities. At2g23510, which is expressed mainly in seeds, encodes a spermidine sinapoyl CoA acyltransferase (SDT) that is required for the production of disinapoyl spermidine and its glucoside in Arabidopsis seed. The structurally related BAHD enzyme encoded by At2g25150 is expressed specifically in roots and has spermidine coumaroyl CoA acyltransferase (SCT) activity both in vitro and in vivo. Phenolamides, so called hydroxycinnamic acid amides, are specialized metabolites produced in higher plants, involved in development, reproduction and serve as defence compounds in biotic interactions. Among them, trihydroxycinnamoyl spermidine derivatives were initially found to be synthetized by a spermidine hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (AtSHT) in Arabidopsis thaliana and to accumulate in the pollen coat. This study reports the identification, in Malus domestica, of an acyltransferase able to complement the sht mutant of Arabidopsis. The quantitative RT-PCR expression profile of MdSHT reveals a specific expression in flowers coordinated with anther development and tapetum cell activities. Three phenolamides including N (1),N (5),N (10)-tricoumaroyl spermidine and N (1),N (5)-dicoumaroyl-N (10)-caffeoyl spermidine identified by LC/MS, were shown to accumulate specifically in pollen grain coat of apple tree. Moreover, in vitro biochemical characterization confirmed MdSHT capacity to synthesize tri-substituted spermidine derivatives with a substrate specificity restricted to p-coumaroyl-CoA and caffeoyl-CoA as an acyl donor. Further investigations of the presence of tri-substituted hydroxycinnamoyl spermidine conjugates in higher plants were performed by targeted metabolic analyses in pollens coupled with bioinformatic analyses of putative SHT orthologues in a wide range of available plant genomes. This work highlights a probable early evolutionary appearance in the common ancestral core Eudicotyledons of a novel enzyme from the BAHD acyltransferase superfamily, dedicated to the synthesis of trihydroxycinnamoyl spermidines in pollen coat. This pathway was maintained in most species; however, recent evolutionary divergences have appeared among Eudicotyledons, such as an organ reallocation of SHT gene expression in Fabales and a loss of SHT in Malvales and Cucurbitales.",

         "Piperine, possibly along with its isomer chavicine, is the compound responsible for the pungency of black pepper and long pepper. It has been used in some forms of traditional medicine. == Preparation == Due to its poor solubility in water, piperine is typically extracted from black pepper by using organic solvents like dichloromethane. The amount of piperine varies from 1–2% in long pepper, to 5–10% in commercial white and black peppers. Piperine can also be prepared by treating the solvent-free residue from a concentrated alcoholic extract of black pepper with a solution of potassium hydroxide to remove resin (said to contain chavicine, an isomer of piperine). The solution is decanted from the insoluble residue and left to stand overnight in alcohol. During this period, the alkaloid slowly crystallizes from the solution. Piperine has been synthesized by the action of piperonoyl chloride on piperidine. == Reactions == Piperine forms salts only with strong acids. The platinichloride B4·H2PtCl6 forms orange-red needles (\"B\" denotes one mole of the alkaloid base in this and the following formula). Iodine in potassium iodide added to an alcoholic solution of the base in the presence of a little hydrochloric acid gives a characteristic periodide, B2·HI·I2, crystallizing in steel-blue needles with melting point 145 °C. Piperine can be hydrolyzed by an alkali into piperidine and piperic acid. In light, especially ultraviolet light, piperine is changed into its isomers chavicine, isochavicine and isopiperine, which are tasteless. == History == Piperine was discovered in 1819 by Hans Christian Ørsted, who isolated it from the fruits of Piper nigrum, the source plant of both black and white pepper. Piperine was also found in Piper longum and Piper officinarum (Miq.) C. DC.

         " The ACTH/MSH cells of the pars distalis and pars intermedia of the mammalian hypophysis contain peptides with amino-terminal tryptophan which exhibit a strong fluorescence after treatment with modified formaldehyde vapour methods and with glyoxylic acid in the tissue sections from freeze-dried specimens. By homogenization of the hypophyses in ethanolic glyoxylic acid and subsequent heating the peptides can be converted to highly fluorescent beta-carboline derivatives; these can then be extracted with glacial acetic acid, separated by silica gel thin-layer chromatography and identified in UV light. Amino-terminal tryptophyl peptide from adult human hypophysis extracted and treated in this way gave the structure L-tryptophylglycine after acid hydrolysis. This structure was subsequently confirmed by producing a fluorescent derivative from authentic L-tryptophylglycine using the same reaction conditions as for the tissue homogenate. This derivative moved in the same way in thin-layer chromatography as fluorecent amino-terminal tryptophyl peptide extracted from human hypophysis. Thereafter a study was made of the antinociceptive effects of authentic L-tryptophylglycine administered subcutaneously in mice both alone and together with morphine. L-tryptophylglycine had no antinociceptive effects alone and neither did it change morphine antinociception. Also it had no apparent effects on the behaviour of mice. Thus, ACTH/MSH cells contain a dipeptide whose physiological function differs from the effects of ACTH, MSH and endorphins. To investigate the mechanism of structural changes of a peptide nanotube and water confined inside the channel, the helical peptide tryptophylglycine monohydrate (WG.H2O) was studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the three-dimension parallel MD program ddgmq (software package) and a consistent force field. Simulations were performed on both the water-containing system and a model system without water molecules. The details of the structural behavior with temperature are investigated for the entire simulated temperature range. Phase transitions were obtained at 115, 245, 270, 310, and 385 K, due to the contributions of both the peptide and the confined water subsystems. The crystalline, amorphous, liquidlike, liquid, and superheated phases of water were observed in the temperature ranges 40-115, 115-245, 245-310, 310-385, and >385 K, respectively. At 300 K, the diffusion constant of the confined water is 0.46 x 10-5 cm2 s-1, a value comparable to that of other peptide nanotubes. The empty peptide system melts at 440 K. Mechanisms of the negative thermal expansion (NTE) along the tube axis were investigated for different temperature ranges. The contraction of the crystalline water (or amorphous water) draws also the tube walls in and leads to NTE below 245 K. The other NTEs appear to be connected to the collapse of the ice network or the solid peptide network between 245 K and room temperature or from 310 to 440 K, respectively.",

         " Carbamazepine is a widely used anticonvulsant. Its metabolite, carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, has been found to display similar anticonvulsant and neurotoxic properties. While the ratio of parent to metabolite concentration varies significantly, at therapeutic doses the epoxide concentration is generally about 20% of the parent. We report a case of fatal carbamazepine overdose in which the epoxide metabolite concentration was found to be 450% higher than the parent compound, suggesting a potential role for metabolite quantification in severe toxicity. Carbamazepine is one of the most commonly used antiseizure medications. Although carbamazepine pharmacokinetics in epileptic patients is well described, much less is known about these processes in the patients who experienced self-poisoning episode by this drug. Therefore, the aim of our investigation was to perform population toxicokinetics of carbamazepine and its metabolite carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide in adults. Software program NONMEM and the ADVAN2 TRANS2 subroutine were used for establishing a population toxicokinetic model for the estimation of clearance and volume of distribution based on of the sum values of carbamazepine and carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide concentrations. Our results indicated that the adult patients' ability to eliminate carbamazepine and carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide following acute carbamazepine self-poisoning was strongly associated with the high levels of CRP and ASP, as well as by the treatment with sedation. Our study should provide better understanding of the toxicokinetics of carbamazepine taken in overdose and better management of patient population admitted to hospital. Measure of drug-mediated immune reactions that are dependent on the patient's genotype determine individual medication protocols. Despite extensive clinical trials prior to the license of a specific drug, certain patient-specific immune reactions cannot be reliably predicted. The need for acknowledgement of the actual proteomic state for selected individuals under drug administration becomes obvious. The well-established association between certain HLA molecules and drugs or their metabolites has been analyzed in recent years, yet the polymorphic nature of HLA makes a broad prediction unfeasible. Dependent on the patient's genotype, carbamazepine (CBZ) hypersensitivities can cause diverse disease symptoms as maculopapular exanthema, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms or the more severe diseases Stevens-Johnson-Syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis. Not only the association between HLA-B*15:02 or HLA-A*31:01 but also between HLA-B*57:01 and CBZ administration could be demonstrated. This study aimed to illuminate the mechanism of HLA-B*57:01-mediated CBZ hypersensitivity by full proteome analysis. The main CBZ metabolite EPX introduced drastic proteomic alterations as the induction of inflammatory processes through the upstream kinase ERBB2 and the upregulation of NFκB and JAK/STAT pathway implying a pro-apoptotic, pro-necrotic shift in the cellular response. Anti-inflammatory pathways and associated effector proteins were downregulated. This disequilibrium of pro- and anti-inflammatory processes clearly explain fatal immune reactions following CBZ administration.",

         "Nicotinamide (INN, BAN UK) or niacinamide (USAN US) is a form of vitamin B3 found in food and used as a dietary supplement and medication. As a supplement, it is used orally (swallowed by mouth) to prevent and treat pellagra (niacin deficiency). While nicotinic acid (niacin) may be used for this purpose, nicotinamide has the benefit of not causing skin flushing. As a cream, it is used to treat acne, and has been observed in clinical studies to improve the appearance of aging skin by reducing hyperpigmentation and redness. It is a water-soluble vitamin. Side effects are minimal. At high doses, liver problems may occur. Normal amounts are safe for use during pregnancy. Nicotinamide is in the vitamin B family of medications, specifically the vitamin B3 complex. It is an amide of nicotinic acid. Foods that contain nicotinamide include yeast, meat, milk, and green vegetables. Nicotinamide was discovered between 1935 and 1937. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. Nicotinamide is available as a generic medication and over the counter. Commercially, nicotinamide is made from either nicotinic acid (niacin) or nicotinonitrile. In some countries, grains have nicotinamide added to them. == Medical uses == === Niacin deficiency === Nicotinamide is the preferred treatment for pellagra, caused by niacin deficiency. === Acne === Nicotinamide cream is used as a treatment for acne. It has anti-inflammatory actions, which may benefit people with inflammatory skin conditions. Nicotinamide increases the biosynthesis of ceramides in human keratinocytes in vitro and improves the epidermal permeability barrier in vivo. The application of 2% topical nicotinamide for 2 and 4 weeks has been found to be effective in lowering the sebum excretion rate. Nicotinamide has been shown to prevent Cutibacterium acnes-induced activation of toll-like receptor 2, which ultimately results in the down-regulation of pro-inflammatory interleukin-8 production. === Skin cancer === Nicotinamide at doses of 500 to 1000 mg a day decreases the risk of skin cancers, other than melanoma, in those at high risk. == Side effects == Nicotinamide has minimal side effects. At very high doses above 3g/ day acute liver toxicity has been documented in at least one case. Normal doses are safe during pregnancy. == Chemistry == The structure of nicotinamide consists of a pyridine ring to which a primary amide group is attached in the meta position. It is an amide of nicotinic acid. As an aromatic compound, it undergoes electrophilic substitution reactions and transformations of its two functional groups. Examples of these reactions reported in Organic Syntheses include the preparation of 2-chloronicotinonitrile by a two-step process via the N-oxide, from nicotinonitrile by reaction with phosphorus pentoxide, and from 3-aminopyridine by reaction with a solution of sodium hypobromite, prepared in situ from bromine and sodium hydroxide. === Industrial production === The hydrolysis of nicotinonitrile is catalysed by the enzyme nitrile hydratase from Rhodococcus rhodochrous J1, producing 3500 tons per annum of nicotinamide for use in animal feed. The enzyme allows for a more selective synthesis as further hydrolysis of the amide to nicotinic acid is avoided. Nicotinamide can also be made from nicotinic acid. According to Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, worldwide 31,000 tons of nicotinamide were sold in 2014. === Biochemistry === Nicotinamide, as a part of the cofactor nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH / NAD+) is crucial to life. In cells, nicotinamide is incorporated into NAD+ and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+). NAD+ and NADP+ are cofactors in a wide variety of enzymatic oxidation-reduction reactions, most notably glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain. If humans ingest nicotinamide, it will likely undergo a series of reactions that transform it into NAD, which can then undergo a transformation to form NADP+. This method of creation of NAD+ is called a salvage pathway. However, the human body can produce NAD+ from the amino acid tryptophan and niacin without our ingestion of nicotinamide. NAD+ acts as an electron carrier that mediates the interconversion of energy between nutrients and the cell's energy currency, adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In oxidation-reduction reactions, the active part of the cofactor is the nicotinamide. In NAD+, the nitrogen in the aromatic nicotinamide ring is covalently bonded to adenine dinucleotide. The formal charge on the nitrogen is stabilized by the shared electrons of the other carbon atoms in the aromatic ring. When a hydride atom is added onto NAD+ to form NADH, the molecule loses its aromaticity, and therefore a good amount of stability. This higher energy product later releases its energy with the release of a hydride, and in the case of the electron transport chain, it assists in forming adenosine triphosphate. When one mole of NADH is oxidized, 158.2 kJ of energy will be released. === Biological role === Nicotinamide occurs as a component of a variety of biological systems, including within the vitamin B family and specifically the vitamin B3 complex. It is also a critically important part of the structures of NADH and NAD+, where the N-substituted aromatic ring in the oxidised NAD+ form undergoes reduction with hydride attack to form NADH. The NADPH/NADP+ structures have the same ring, and are involved in similar biochemical reactions. Nicotinamide can be methylated in the liver to biologically active 1-Methylnicotinamide when there are sufficient methyl donors. == Food sources == Nicotinamide occurs in trace amounts mainly in meat, fish, nuts, and mushrooms, as well as to a lesser extent in some vegetables. It is commonly added to cereals and other foods. Many multivitamins contain 20–30 mg of vitamin B3 and it is also available in higher doses. == Compendial status == British Pharmacopoeia Japanese Pharmacopoeia == Research == A 2015 trial found nicotinamide to reduce the rate of new nonmelanoma skin cancers and actinic keratoses in a group of people at high risk for the conditions. Nicotinamide has been investigated for many additional disorders, including treatment of bullous pemphigoid nonmelanoma skin cancers. Nicotinamide may be beneficial in treating psoriasis. There is tentative evidence for a potential role of nicotinamide in treating acne, rosacea, autoimmune blistering disorders, ageing skin, and atopic dermatitis. Nicotinamide also inhibits poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARP-1), enzymes involved in the rejoining of DNA strand breaks induced by radiation or chemotherapy. ARCON (accelerated radiotherapy plus carbogen inhalation and nicotinamide) has been studied in cancer. Research has suggested nicotinamide may play a role in the treatment of HIV. == References ==",

         "Telmisartan, sold under the brand name Micardis among others, is a medication used to treat high blood pressure and heart failure. It is a reasonable initial treatment for high blood pressure. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include upper respiratory tract infections, diarrhea, and back pain. Serious side effects may include kidney problems, low blood pressure, and angioedema. Use in pregnancy may harm the baby and use when breastfeeding is not recommended. It is an angiotensin II receptor blocker and works by blocking the effects of angiotensin II. Telmisartan was patented in 1991 and came into medical use in 1999. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 228th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. It is available in combination with hydrochlorothiazide as telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide; with cilnidipine as telmisartan/cilnidipine; and with amlodipine as telmisartan/amlodipine. == Medical uses == Telmisartan is used to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and diabetic kidney disease. It is a reasonable initial treatment for high blood pressure.: 146 == Contraindications == Telmisartan is contraindicated during pregnancy. Telmisartan affects the renin–angiotensin system and can cause birth defects, stillbirths, and neonatal deaths. It is not known whether the medication passes into breast milk. == Side effects == Side effects include tachycardia and bradycardia (fast or slow heartbeat), hypotension (low blood pressure) and edema (swelling of arms, legs, lips, tongue, or throat, the latter leading to breathing problems). Allergic reactions may also occur. == Interactions == Due to its mechanism of action, telmisartan increases blood potassium levels. Combination with potassium preparations or potassium-sparing diuretics could cause hyperkalaemia (excessive potassium levels). Combination with NSAIDs, especially in patients with impaired kidney function, has a risk of causing (usually reversible) kidney failure. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Telmisartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker that shows high affinity for the angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1), with a binding affinity 3000 times greater for AT1 than AT2. In addition to blocking the renin–angiotensin system, telmisartan acts as a partial agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ), a central regulator of insulin and glucose metabolism. It is believed that telmisartan's dual mode of action may provide protective benefits against the vascular and renal damage caused by diabetes and cardiovascular disease (CVD).: 171 As a partial agonist, it activates the receptor by 25–30%. Clinical trials have shown that telmisartan increases insulin sensitivity, reduces cardiac fibrosis and hypertrophy, and improves endothilial function; all these effects can be attributed to its activity on PPAR-γ. The kidney-protecting activity of telmisartan is attributed to both angiotensin II antagonism and improved endothelial function from PPAR-γ. Telmisartan's activity at the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPAR-δ) receptor has prompted speculation around its potential as a sport doping agent as an alternative to GW 501516. Telmisartan activates PPAR-δ receptors in several tissues. In mice, this results in effects such as enhanced endurance. However, telmisartan does not improve the walking performance (6-minute walk distance) in people with lower extremity peripheral artery disease. Telmisartan activates PPAR-α in vitro. === Pharmacokinetics === The substance is quickly but to varying degrees absorbed from the gut. The average bioavailability is about 50% (42–100%). Food intake has no clinically relevant influence on the kinetics of telmisartan. Plasma protein binding is over 99.5%, mainly to albumin and alpha-1-acid glycoprotein. It has the longest half-life of any angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) (24 hours) and the largest volume of distribution among ARBs (500 liters). Less than 3% of telmisartan is inactivated by glucuronidation in the liver, and over 97% is eliminated in unchanged form via bile and faeces. == History == == Society and culture == Telmisartan is available as a generic medication. == Research == Telmisartan does not appear effective for slowing the growth of abdominal aortic aneurysm. Telmisartan does not cause rapid cancer growth like the PPAR-δ agonist GW 501516, but whether it causes a change in cancer rates is disputed. Short-term use is not associated with an increased incidence of cancer over other ARB drugs, according to a large 2016 analysis of UK patients. A 2022 meta-analysis finds that a longer duration of taking ARBs (including telmisartan) is associated with an increase in cancer rates. Patients who have taken an ARB for more than 3 years appears 11% more likely to develop cancer. A 2023 large-scale study on Lebanese patients finds that taking ARBs reduces the incidence of cancer, with greater effects on those who have taken the drug for a long time. A 2021 Korean study and a 2012 Japanese study finds similar results. == References == == Further reading ==",

         "Levocetirizine, sold under the brand name Xyzal, among others, is a second-generation antihistamine used for the treatment of allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and long-term hives of unclear cause. It is less sedating than older antihistamines. It is taken by mouth. Common side effects include sleepiness, dry mouth, cough, vomiting, and diarrhea. Use in pregnancy appears safe but has not been well studied and use when breastfeeding is of unclear safety. It is classified as a second-generation antihistamine and works by blocking histamine H1-receptors. Levocetirizine was approved for medical use in the United States in 2007, and is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 152nd most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 3 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Levocetirizine is used for allergic rhinitis. This includes allergy symptoms such as watery eyes, runny nose, sneezing, hives, and itching. == Side effects == Levocetirizine is referred to as a non-sedating antihistamine as it does not enter the brain in significant amounts and is therefore unlikely to cause drowsiness. Cardiac safety with repolarization may be better than some other antihistamines, as levocetirizine does not significantly prolong the QT interval in healthy individuals. However, some people may still experience some slight sleepiness, headache, mouth dryness, lightheadedness, vision problems (mainly blurred vision), palpitations and fatigue. == Pharmacology == Levocetirizine is an antihistamine. It acts as an inverse agonist that decreases activity at histamine H1 receptors. This in turn prevents the release of other allergy chemicals and increases the blood supply to the area, providing relief from the typical symptoms of hay fever. Levocetirizine, (R)-(-)-cetirizine, is essentially a chiral switch of (±)-cetirizine. This enantiomer, the eutomer, is more selective and the (S)-counterpart, the distomer, is inactive. == Chemistry == Chemically, levocetirizine is the active levorotary enantiomer of cetirizine, also called the l-enantiomer of cetirizine. It is a member of the diphenylmethylpiperazine group of antihistamines. == History == Levocetirizine was first launched in 2001 by the Belgian pharmaceutical company UCB (Union Chimique Belge). == Society and culture == === Availability === In January 2017, the US Food and Drug Administration approved an over-the-counter preparation. Levocetirizine had previously received authorization by the FDA as a prescription drug in 2007, having already been brought to market throughout much of Europe. In India, a prescription-only drug containing levocetirizine hydrochloride and montelukast is sold as Crohist MK. === Brand names === Preparations of levocetirizine are sold under the following brand names: Xyzal in Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Finland, France, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Ireland (also Rinozal), Italy, Japan, Lithuania, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, The Philippines, Serbia, Singapore, Slovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Switzerland and UK.

Vehicular traffic is an important source of these chemicals in the environment. Despite this, little is known about the occurrence of these chemicals in roadside soils. In this study, we determined the concentrations, profiles, and distribution patterns of 3 DPGs, 5 BTHs, and 7 BTRs in 110 soil samples collected from northeastern United States. We found widespread occurrence of 12 out of the 15 analytes measured in roadside soils, at detection frequencies ≥71 % and median concentrations in the range of 0.38-380 ng/g (dry weight). DPGs were the predominant chemicals accounting for 63 % of the sum concentrations of three chemical classes determined, followed by BTHs (28 %) and BTRs (9 %). The concentrations of all analytes (except for 1-, 4-, and 5-OH-BTRs) exhibited significant positive correlations (r: 0.1-0.9, p < 0.01), suggestive of their common sources and/or similar environmental fates. Higher concentrations of DPGs, BTHs and BTRs were found in soils from highways, rubberized playgrounds, and indoor parking lots than those from gardens, parks, and residential areas. Our findings suggest the release of DPGs, BTHs and BTRs from rubber products, especially automobile tires.

         " Acetaminophen (APAP)-induced liver injury (AILI) is a pressing public health concern. Although evidence suggests that Bifidobacterium adolescentis (B. adolescentis) can be used to treat liver disease, it is unclear if it can prevent AILI. In this report, we prove that B. adolescentis significantly attenuated AILI in mice, as demonstrated through biochemical analysis, histopathology, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. Based on untargeted metabolomics and in vitro cultures, we found that B. adolescentis generates microbial metabolite hypaphorine. Functionally, hypaphorine inhibits the inflammatory response and hepatic oxidative stress to alleviate AILI in mice. Transcriptomic analysis indicates that Cry1 expression is increased in APAP-treated mice after hypaphorine treatment. Overexpression of Cry1 by its stabilizer KL001 effectively mitigates liver damage arising from oxidative stress in APAP-treated mice. Using the gene expression omnibus (GEO) database, we verified that Cry1 gene expression was also decreased in patients with APAP-induced acute liver failure. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that B. adolescentis inhibits APAP-induced liver injury by generating hypaphorine, which subsequently upregulates Cry1 to decrease inflammation and oxidative stress. Acetylcholinesterase (AChEis) inhibitors are used to treat neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease (AD). l-Hypaphorine (l-HYP) is a natural indole alkaloid that has been shown to have effects on the central nervous system (CNS). The goal of this research was to synthesize l-HYP and d-HYP and test their anticholinesterasic properties in rat brain regions. l-HYP suppressed acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity only in the cerebellum, whereas d-HYP inhibited AChE activity in all CNS regions studied. No cytotoxic effect on normal human cells (HaCaT) was observed in the case of l-HYP and d-HYP although an increase in cell proliferation. Molecular modeling studies revealed that d-HYP and l-HYP have significant differences in their binding mode positions and interact stereospecifically with AChE's amino acid residues. In metabolomic analysis of human milk amines, we found a previously unidentified compound. This was tentatively identified as hypaphorine, an indole alkaloid composed of tryptophan and three methyls, and with neurological and glucose-lowering effects in rodents. Hypaphorine identity was confirmed by hypaphorine synthesis, and then a fluorometric method was developed to quantify hypaphorine in milk and foods. Using dietary records, we identified peanut products as probable sources of hypaphorine. Milk from 24 lactating women showed widely varying hypaphorine, with a mean ± SD 0.34 ± 0.33 μM, and the highest concentration of 1.24 μM. Peanuts showed high hypaphorine of 70 μg/g compared to 60 and 100 μg/g in dried chickpeas and lentils. Dietary challenge in lactating women with hypaphorine-rich foods demonstrated transfer of hypaphorine into milk with hypaphorine appearance peaking 5-18 h after consumption and prolonged disappearance indicative of slow excretion or metabolism. The potential functional roles of hypaphorine in human nutrition remain to be addressed.",

         "Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is a vitamin found in food and sold as a dietary supplement. It is essential to the formation of two major coenzymes, flavin mononucleotide and flavin adenine dinucleotide. These coenzymes are involved in energy metabolism, cellular respiration, and antibody production, as well as normal growth and development. The coenzymes are also required for the metabolism of niacin, vitamin B6, and folate. Riboflavin is prescribed to treat corneal thinning, and taken orally, may reduce the incidence of migraine headaches in adults. Riboflavin deficiency is rare and is usually accompanied by deficiencies of other vitamins and nutrients. It may be prevented or treated by oral supplements or by injections. As a water-soluble vitamin, any riboflavin consumed in excess of nutritional requirements is not stored; it is either not absorbed or is absorbed and quickly excreted in urine, causing the urine to have a bright yellow tint. Natural sources of riboflavin include meat, fish and fowl, eggs, dairy products, green vegetables, mushrooms, and almonds. Some countries require its addition to grains. In its purified, solid form, it is a water-soluble yellow-orange crystalline powder. In addition to its function as a vitamin, it is used as a food coloring agent. Biosynthesis takes place in bacteria, fungi and plants, but not animals. Industrial synthesis of riboflavin was initially achieved using a chemical process, but current commercial manufacturing relies on fermentation methods using strains of fungi and genetically modified bacteria. == Definition == Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is a water-soluble vitamin and is one of the B vitamins. Unlike folate and vitamin B6, which occur in several chemically related forms known as vitamers, riboflavin is only one chemical compound. It is a starting compound in the synthesis of the coenzymes flavin mononucleotide (FMN, also known as riboflavin-5'-phosphate) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). FAD is the more abundant form of flavin, reported to bind to 75% of the number of flavin-dependent protein encoded genes in the all-species genome (the flavoproteome) and serves as a co-enzyme for 84% of human-encoded flavoproteins. In its purified, solid form, riboflavin is a yellow-orange crystalline powder with a slight odor and bitter taste. It is soluble in polar solvents, such as water and aqueous sodium chloride solutions, and slightly soluble in alcohols. It is not soluble in non-polar or weakly polar organic solvents such as chloroform, benzene or acetone. In solution or during dry storage as a powder, riboflavin is heat stable if not exposed to light. When heated to decompose, it releases toxic fumes containing nitric oxide. == Functions == Riboflavin is essential to the formation of two major coenzymes, FMN and FAD. These coenzymes are involved in energy metabolism, cell respiration, antibody production, growth and development. Riboflavin is essential for the metabolism of carbohydrates, protein and fats. FAD contributes to the conversion of tryptophan to niacin (vitamin B3) and the conversion of vitamin B6 to the coenzyme pyridoxal 5'-phosphate requires FMN. Riboflavin is involved in maintaining normal circulating levels of homocysteine; in riboflavin deficiency, homocysteine levels increase, elevating the risk of cardiovascular diseases. === Redox reactions === Redox reactions are processes that involve the transfer of electrons. The flavin coenzymes support the function of roughly 70-80 flavoenzymes in humans (and hundreds more across all organisms, including those encoded by archeal, bacterial and fungal genomes) that are responsible for one- or two-electron redox reactions which capitalize on the ability of flavins to be converted between oxidized, half-reduced and fully reduced forms. FAD is also required for the activity of glutathione reductase, an essential enzyme in the formation of the endogenous antioxidant, glutathione. === Micronutrient metabolism === Riboflavin, FMN, and FAD are involved in the metabolism of niacin, vitamin B6, and folate. The synthesis of the niacin-containing coenzymes, NAD and NADP, from tryptophan involves the FAD-dependent enzyme, kynurenine 3-monooxygenase. Dietary deficiency of riboflavin can decrease the production of NAD and NADP, thereby promoting niacin deficiency. Conversion of vitamin B6 to its coenzyme, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, involves the enzyme, pyridoxine 5'-phosphate oxidase, which requires FMN. An enzyme involved in folate metabolism, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, requires FAD to form the amino acid, methionine, from homocysteine. Riboflavin deficiency appears to impair the metabolism of the dietary mineral, iron, which is essential to the production of hemoglobin and red blood cells. Alleviating riboflavin deficiency in people who are deficient in both riboflavin and iron improves the effectiveness of iron supplementation for treating iron-deficiency anemia. == Synthesis == === Biosynthesis === Biosynthesis takes place in bacteria, fungi and plants, but not animals. The biosynthetic precursors to riboflavin are ribulose 5-phosphate and guanosine triphosphate. The former is converted to L-3,4-dihydroxy-2-butanone-4-phosphate while the latter is transformed in a series of reactions that lead to 5-amino-6-(D-ribitylamino)uracil. These two compounds are then the substrates for the penultimate step in the pathway, catalysed by the enzyme lumazine synthase in reaction EC 2.5.1.78. In the final step of the biosynthesis, two molecules of 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine are combined by the enzyme riboflavin synthase in a dismutation reaction. This generates one molecule of riboflavin and one of 5-amino-6-(D-ribitylamino) uracil. The latter is recycled to the previous reaction in the sequence. Conversions of riboflavin to the cofactors FMN and FAD are carried out by the enzymes riboflavin kinase and FAD synthetase acting sequentially. === Industrial synthesis === The industrial-scale production of riboflavin uses various microorganisms, including filamentous fungi such as Ashbya gossypii, Candida famata and Candida flaveri, as well as the bacteria Corynebacterium ammoniagenes and Bacillus subtilis. B. subtilis that has been genetically modified to both increase the production of riboflavin and to introduce an antibiotic (ampicillin) resistance marker, is employed at a commercial scale to produce riboflavin for feed and food fortification. By 2012, over 4,000 tonnes per annum were produced by such fermentation processes. In the presence of high concentrations of hydrocarbons or aromatic compounds, some bacteria overproduce riboflavin, possibly as a protective mechanism. One such organism is Micrococcus luteus (American Type Culture Collection strain number ATCC 49442), which develops a yellow color due to production of riboflavin while growing on pyridine, but not when grown on other substrates, such as succinic acid. === Laboratory synthesis === The first total synthesis of riboflavin was carried out by Richard Kuhn's group. A substituted aniline, produced by reductive amination using D-ribose, was condensed with alloxan in the final step: == Uses == === Treatment of corneal thinning === Keratoconus is the most common form of corneal ectasia, a progressive thinning of the cornea. The condition is treated by corneal collagen cross-linking, which increases corneal stiffness. Cross-linking is achieved by applying a topical riboflavin solution to the cornea, which is then exposed to ultraviolet A light. === Migraine prevention === In its 2012 guidelines, the American Academy of Neurology stated that high-dose riboflavin (400 mg) is \"probably effective and should be considered for migraine prevention,\" a recommendation also provided by the UK National Migraine Centre. A 2017 review reported that daily riboflavin taken at 400 mg per day for at least three months may reduce the frequency of migraine headaches in adults. Research on high-dose riboflavin for migraine prevention or treatment in children and adolescents is inconclusive, and so supplements are not recommended. === Food coloring === Riboflavin is used as a food coloring (yellow-orange crystalline powder), and is designated with the E number, E101, in Europe for use as a food additive. == Dietary recommendations == The National Academy of Medicine updated the Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for riboflavin in 1998. The EARs for riboflavin for women and men aged 14 and over are 0.9 mg/day and 1.1 mg/day, respectively; the RDAs are 1.1 and 1.3 mg/day, respectively. RDAs are higher than EARs to provide adequate intake levels for individuals with higher than average requirements. The RDA during pregnancy is 1.4 mg/day and the RDA for lactating females is 1.6 mg/day. For infants up to the age of 12 months, the Adequate Intake (AI) is 0.3–0.4 mg/day and for children aged 1–13 years the RDA increases with age from 0.5 to 0.9 mg/day. As for safety, the IOM sets tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of riboflavin there is no UL, as there is no human data for adverse effects from high doses. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL are defined the same as in United States. For women and men aged 15 and older the PRI is set at 1.6 mg/day. The PRI during pregnancy is 1.9 mg/day and the PRI for lactating females is 2.0 mg/day. For children aged 1–14 years the PRIs increase with age from 0.6 to 1.4 mg/day. These PRIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs. The EFSA also considered the maximum safe intake and like the U.S. National Academy of Medicine, decided that there was not sufficient information to set an UL. === Safety === In humans, there is no evidence for riboflavin toxicity produced by excessive intakes and absorption becomes less efficient as dosage increases. Any excess riboflavin is excreted via the kidneys into urine, resulting in a bright yellow color known as flavinuria. During a clinical trial on the effectiveness of riboflavin for treating the frequency and severity of migraines, subjects were given up to 400 mg of riboflavin orally per day for periods of 3–12 months. Abdominal pains and diarrhea were among the side effects reported. === Labeling === For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For riboflavin labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 1.7 mg, but as of May 27, 2016, it was revised to 1.3 mg to bring it into agreement with the RDA. A table of the old and new adult daily values is provided at Reference Daily Intake. == Sources == The United States Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service maintains a food composition database from which riboflavin content in hundreds of foods can be searched. The white flour produced after milling of wheat has only 67% of its original riboflavin amount left, so white flour is enriched in some countries. Riboflavin is also added to ready-to-eat breakfast cereals. It is difficult to incorporate riboflavin into liquid products because it has poor solubility in water, hence the requirement for riboflavin-5'-phosphate (FMN, also called E101 when used as colorant), a more soluble form of riboflavin. The enrichment of bread and ready-to-eat breakfast cereals contributes significantly to the dietary supply of the vitamin. Free riboflavin is naturally present in animal-sourced foods along with protein-bound FMN and FAD. Cows' milk contains mainly free riboflavin, but both FMN and FAD are present at low concentrations. === Fortification === Some countries require or recommend fortification of grain foods. As of 2024, 57 countries, mostly in North and South America and southeast Africa, require food fortification of wheat flour or maize (corn) flour with riboflavin or riboflavin-5'-phosphate sodium. The amounts stipulated range from 1.3 to 5.75 mg/kg. An additional 16 countries have a voluntary fortification program. For example, the Indian government recommends 4.0 mg/kg for \"maida\" (white) and \"atta\" (whole wheat) flour. == Absorption, metabolism, excretion == More than 90% of riboflavin in the diet is in the form of protein-bound FMN and FAD. Exposure to gastric acid in the stomach releases the coenzymes, which are subsequently enzymatically hydrolyzed in the proximal small intestine to release free riboflavin. Absorption occurs via a rapid active transport system, with some additional passive diffusion occurring at high concentrations. Bile salts facilitate uptake, so absorption is improved when the vitamin is consumed with a meal. The majority of newly absorbed riboflavin is taken up by the liver on the first pass, indicating that postprandial appearance of riboflavin in blood plasma may underestimate absorption. Three riboflavin transporter proteins have been identified: RFVT1 is present in the small intestine and also in the placenta; RFVT2 is highly expressed in brain and salivary glands; and RFVT3 is most highly expressed in the small intestine, testes, and prostate. Infants with mutations in the genes encoding these transport proteins can be treated with riboflavin administered orally. Riboflavin is reversibly converted to FMN and then FAD. From riboflavin to FMN is the function of zinc-requiring riboflavin kinase; the reverse is accomplished by a phosphatase. From FMN to FAD is the function of magnesium-requiring FAD synthase; the reverse is accomplished by a pyrophosphatase. FAD appears to be an inhibitory end-product that down-regulates its own formation. When excess riboflavin is absorbed by the small intestine, it is quickly removed from the blood and excreted in urine. Urine color is used as a hydration status biomarker and, under normal conditions, correlates with urine specific gravity and urine osmolality. However, riboflavin supplementation in large excess of requirements causes urine to appear more yellow than normal. With normal dietary intake, about two-thirds of urinary output is riboflavin, the remainder having been partially metabolized to hydroxymethylriboflavin from oxidation within cells, and as other metabolites. When consumption exceeds the ability to absorb, riboflavin passes into the large intestine, where it is catabolized by bacteria to various metabolites that can be detected in feces. There is speculation that unabsorbed riboflavin could affect the large intestine microbiome. == Deficiency == === Prevalence === Riboflavin deficiency is uncommon in the United States and in other countries with wheat flour or corn meal fortification programs. From data collected in biannual surveys of the U.S. population, for ages 20 and over, 22% of women and 19% of men reported consuming a supplement that contained riboflavin, typically a vitamin-mineral multi-supplement. For the non-supplement users, the dietary intake of adult women averaged 1.74 mg/day and men 2.44 mg/day. These amounts exceed the RDAs for riboflavin of 1.1 and 1.3 mg/day respectively. For all age groups, on average, consumption from food exceeded the RDAs. A 2001-02 U.S. survey reported that less than 3% of the population consumed less than the Estimated Average Requirement of riboflavin. === Signs and symptoms === Riboflavin deficiency (also called ariboflavinosis) results in stomatitis, symptoms of which include chapped and fissured lips, inflammation of the corners of the mouth (angular stomatitis), sore throat, painful red tongue, and hair loss. The eyes can become itchy, watery, bloodshot, and sensitive to light. Riboflavin deficiency is associated with anemia. Prolonged riboflavin insufficiency may cause degeneration of the liver and nervous system. Riboflavin deficiency may increase the risk of preeclampsia in pregnant women. Deficiency of riboflavin during pregnancy can result in fetal birth defects, including heart and limb deformities. === Risk factors === People at risk of having low riboflavin levels include alcoholics, vegetarian athletes, and practitioners of veganism. Pregnant or lactating women and their infants may also be at risk, if the mother avoids meat and dairy products. Anorexia and lactose intolerance increase the risk of riboflavin deficiency. People with physically demanding lives, such as athletes and laborers, may require higher riboflavin intake. The conversion of riboflavin into FAD and FMN is impaired in people with hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, and riboflavin transporter deficiency. === Causes === Riboflavin deficiency is usually found together with other nutrient deficiencies, particularly of other water-soluble vitamins. A deficiency of riboflavin can be primary (i.e. caused by poor vitamin sources in the regular diet) or secondary, which may be a result of conditions that affect absorption in the intestine. Secondary deficiencies are typically caused by the body not being able to use the vitamin, or by an increased rate of excretion of the vitamin. Diet patterns that increase risk of deficiency include veganism and low-dairy vegetarianism. Diseases such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes may cause or exacerbate riboflavin deficiency. There are rare genetic defects that compromise riboflavin absorption, transport, metabolism or use by flavoproteins. One of these is riboflavin transporter deficiency, previously known as Brown–Vialetto–Van Laere syndrome. Variants of the genes SLC52A2 and SLC52A3 which code for transporter proteins RDVT2 and RDVT3, respectively, are defective. Infants and young children present with muscle weakness, cranial nerve deficits including hearing loss, sensory symptoms including sensory ataxia, feeding difficulties, and respiratory distress caused by a sensorimotor axonal neuropathy and cranial nerve pathology. When untreated, infants with riboflavin transporter deficiency have labored breathing and are at risk of dying in the first decade of life. Treatment with oral supplementation of high amounts of riboflavin is lifesaving. Other inborn errors of metabolism include riboflavin-responsive multiple acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency, also known as a subset of glutaric acidemia type 2, and the C677T variant of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase enzyme, which in adults has been associated with risk of high blood pressure. === Diagnosis and assessment === The assessment of riboflavin status is essential for confirming cases with non-specific symptoms whenever deficiency is suspected. Total riboflavin excretion in healthy adults with normal riboflavin intake is about 120 micrograms per day, while excretion of less than 40 micrograms per day indicates deficiency. Riboflavin excretion rates decrease as a person ages, but increase during periods of chronic stress and the use of some prescription drugs. Indicators used in humans are erythrocyte glutathione reductase (EGR), erythrocyte flavin concentration and urinary excretion. The erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity coefficient (EGRAC) provides a measure of tissue saturation and long-term riboflavin status. Results are expressed as an activity coefficient ratio, determined by enzyme activity with and without the addition of FAD to the culture medium. An EGRAC of 1.0 to 1.2 indicates that adequate amounts of riboflavin are present; 1.2 to 1.4 is considered low, greater than 1.4 indicates deficient. For the less sensitive \"erythrocyte flavin method\", values greater than 400 nmol/L are considered adequate and values below 270 nmol/L are considered deficient. Urinary excretion is expressed as nmol of riboflavin per gram of creatinine. Low is defined as in the range of 50 to 72 nmol/g. Deficient is below 50 nmol/g. Urinary excretion load tests have been used to determine dietary requirements. For adult men, as oral doses were increased from 0.5 mg to 1.1 mg, there was a modest linear increase in urinary riboflavin, reaching 100 micrograms for a subsequent 24-hour urine collection. Beyond a load dose of 1.1 mg, urinary excretion increased rapidly, so that with a dose of 2.5 mg, urinary output was 800 micrograms for a 24-hour urine collection. == History == The name \"riboflavin\" comes from \"ribose\" (the sugar whose reduced form, ribitol, forms part of its structure) and \"flavin\", the ring-moiety that imparts the yellow color to the oxidized molecule (from Latin flavus, \"yellow\"). The reduced form, which occurs in metabolism along with the oxidized form, appears as orange-yellow needles or crystals. The earliest reported identification, predating any concept of vitamins as essential nutrients, was by Alexander Wynter Blyth. In 1879, Blyth isolated a water-soluble component of cows' milk whey, which he named \"lactochrome\", that fluoresced yellow-green when exposed to light. In the early 1900s, several research laboratories were investigating constituents of foods, essential to maintain growth in rats. These constituents were initially divided into fat-soluble \"vitamine\" A and water-soluble \"vitamine\" B. (The \"e\" was dropped in 1920.) Vitamin B was further thought to have two components, a heat-labile substance called B1 and a heat-stable substance called B2. Vitamin B2 was tentatively identified to be the factor necessary for preventing pellagra, but that was later confirmed to be due to niacin (vitamin B3) deficiency. The confusion was due to the fact that riboflavin (B2) deficiency causes stomatitis symptoms similar to those seen in pellagra, but without the widespread peripheral skin lesions. For this reason, early in the history of identifying riboflavin deficiency in humans the condition was sometimes called \"pellagra sine pellagra\" (pellagra without pellagra). In 1935, Paul Gyorgy, in collaboration with chemist Richard Kuhn and physician T. Wagner-Jauregg, reported that rats kept on a B2-free diet were unable to gain weight. Isolation of B2 from yeast revealed the presence of a bright yellow-green fluorescent product that restored normal growth when fed to rats. The growth restored was directly proportional to the intensity of the fluorescence. This observation enabled the researchers to develop a rapid chemical bioassay in 1933, and then isolate the factor from egg white, calling it ovoflavin. The same group then isolated the a similar preparation from whey and called it lactoflavin. In 1934, Kuhn's group identified the chemical structure of these flavins as identical, settled on \"riboflavin\" as a name, and were also able to synthesize the vitamin. Circa 1937, riboflavin was also referred to as \"Vitamin G\". In 1938, Richard Kuhn was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work on vitamins, which had included B2 and B6. In 1939, it was confirmed that riboflavin is essential for human health through a clinical trial conducted by William H. Sebrell and Roy E. Butler. Women fed a diet low in riboflavin developed stomatitis and other signs of deficiency, which were reversed when treated with synthetic riboflavin. The symptoms returned when the supplements were stopped. == References ==",

         "Mycophenolic acid is an immunosuppressant medication used to prevent rejection following organ transplantation and to treat autoimmune conditions such as Crohn's disease and lupus. Specifically it is used following kidney, heart, and liver transplantation. It can be given by mouth or by injection into a vein. It comes as mycophenolate sodium and mycophenolate mofetil. Common side effects include nausea, infections, and diarrhea. Other serious side effects include an increased risk of cancer, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, anemia, and gastrointestinal bleeding. Use during pregnancy may harm the baby. It works by blocking inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), which is needed by lymphocytes to make guanosine. Mycophenolic acid was initially discovered by Italian Bartolomeo Gosio in 1893. It was rediscovered in 1945 and 1968. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1995 following the discovery of its immunosuppressive properties in the 1990s. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 227th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == === Organ transplant === Mycophenolate is used for the prevention of organ transplant rejection. Mycophenolate mofetil is indicated for the prevention of organ transplant rejection in adults and kidney transplantation rejection in children over 2 years; whereas mycophenolate sodium is indicated for the prevention of kidney transplant rejection in adults. Mycophenolate sodium has also been used for the prevention of rejection in liver, heart, or lung transplants in children older than two years. === Autoimmune disease === Mycophenolate is increasingly utilized as a steroid sparing treatment in autoimmune diseases and similar immune-mediated disorders including Behçet's disease, pemphigus vulgaris, immunoglobulin A nephropathy, small vessel vasculitides, and psoriasis. It is also used for retroperitoneal fibrosis along with a number of other medications. Specifically it has also been used for psoriasis not treatable by other methods. Its increasing application in treating lupus nephritis has demonstrated more frequent complete response and less frequent complications compared to cyclophosphamide bolus therapy, a regimen with risk of bone marrow suppression, infertility, and malignancy. Further work addressing maintenance therapy demonstrated mycophenolate superior to cyclophosphamide, again in terms of response and side-effects. Walsh proposed that mycophenolate should be considered as a first-line induction therapy for treatment of lupus nephritis in people without kidney dysfunction. === Comparison to other agents === Compared with azathioprine it has higher incidence of diarrhea, and no difference in risk of any of the other side effects in transplant patients. Mycophenolic acid is 15 times more expensive than azathioprine. == Adverse effects == Common adverse drug reactions (≥ 1% of people) include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, joint pain; infections, leukopenia, or anemia reflect the immunosuppressive and myelosuppressive nature of the drug. Mycophenolate sodium is also commonly associated with fatigue, headache, cough and/or breathing issues. Intravenous (IV) administration of mycophenolate mofetil is also commonly associated with thrombophlebitis and thrombosis. Infrequent adverse effects (0.1–1% of people) include esophagitis, gastritis, gastrointestinal tract hemorrhage, and/or invasive cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. More rarely, pulmonary fibrosis or various neoplasia occur: melanoma, lymphoma, other malignancies having an occurrences of 1 in 20 to 1 in 200, depending on the type, with neoplasia in the skin being the most common site. Several cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have also been reported. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an alert that people are at increased risk of opportunistic infections, such as activation of latent viral infections, including shingles, other herpes infections, cytomegalovirus, and BK virus associated nephropathy. In addition the FDA is investigating 16 people that developed a rare neurological disease while taking the drug. This is a viral infection known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy; it attacks the brain and is usually fatal. === Pregnancy === Mycophenolic acid is associated with miscarriage and congenital malformations when used during pregnancy, and should be avoided whenever possible by women trying to get pregnant. === Blood tests === Among the most common effects of this drug is increased blood cholesterol levels. Other changes in blood chemistry such as hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hyperkalemia, and an increase in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) can occur. == Mechanism of action == Purines (including the nucleosides guanosine and adenosine) can either be synthesized de novo using ribose 5-phosphate or they can be salvaged from free nucleotides. Mycophenolic acid is a potent, reversible, non-competitive inhibitor of inosine-5′-monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH), an enzyme essential to the de novo synthesis of guanosine-5'-monophosphate (GMP) from inosine-5'-monophosphate (IMP). IMPDH inhibition particularly affects lymphocytes since they rely almost exclusively on de novo purine synthesis. In contrast, many other cell types use both pathways, and some cells, such as terminally differentiated neurons, depend completely on purine nucleotide salvage. Thus, use of mycophenolic acid leads to a relatively selective inhibition of DNA replication in T cells and B cells. == Pharmacology == Mycophenolate can be derived from the fungi Penicillium stoloniferum, P. brevicompactum and P. echinulatum. Mycophenolate mofetil is metabolised in the liver to the active moiety mycophenolic acid. It reversibly inhibits inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, the enzyme that controls the rate of synthesis of guanine monophosphate in the de novo pathway of purine synthesis used in the proliferation of B and T lymphocytes. Other cells recover purines via a separate salvage pathway and are thus able to escape the effect. Mycophenolate is potent and can, in many contexts, be used in place of the older anti-proliferative azathioprine. It is usually used as part of a three-compound regimen of immunosuppressants, also including a calcineurin inhibitor (ciclosporin or tacrolimus) and a glucocorticoid (e.g. dexamethasone or prednisone). == Chemistry == Mycophenolate mofetil is the morpholino‌ ethyl ester of mycophenolic acid; the ester masks the carboxyl group. Mycophenolate mofetil is reported to have a pKa values of 5.6 for the morpholino moiety and 8.5 for the phenolic group. == History == Mycophenolic acid was discovered by Italian medical scientist Bartolomeo Gosio. Gosio collected a fungus from spoiled corn and named it Penicillium glaucum. (The species is now called P. brevicompactum.) In 1893 he found that the fungus had antibacterial activity. In 1896 he isolated crystals of the compound, which he successfully demonstrated as the active antibacterial compound against the anthrax bacterium. This was the first antibiotic that was isolated in pure and crystalline form. But the discovery was forgotten. It was rediscovered by two American scientists C.L. Alsberg and O.M. Black in 1912, and given the name mycophenolic acid. The compound was eventually demonstrated to have antiviral, antifungal, antibacterial, anticancer, and antipsoriasis activities. Although it is not commercialised as antibiotic due to its adverse effects, its modified compound (ester derivative) is an approved immunosuppressant drug in kidney, heart, and liver transplantations, and is marketed under the brands Cellcept (mycophenolate mofetil by Roche) and Myfortic (mycophenolate sodium by Novartis). Cellcept was developed by a South African geneticist Anthony Allison and his wife Elsie M. Eugui. In the 1970s while working at the Medical Research Council, Allison investigated the biochemical causes of immune deficiency in children. He discovered the metabolic pathway involving an enzyme, inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, which is responsible for undesirable immune response in autoimmune diseases, as well as for immune rejection in organ transplantation. He conceived an idea that if a molecule that could block the enzyme is discovered, then, it would become an immunosuppressive drug that could be used for autoimmune diseases and in organ transplantation. In 1981 he decided to go for drug discovery and approached several pharmaceutical companies, which turned him down one by one as he had no primary knowledge of drug research. However, Syntex liked his plans and asked him to join the company with his wife. He became vice president for the research. In one of their experiments the Allisons used an antibacterial compound, mycophenolate mofetil, which was abandoned in clinical use due to its adverse effects. They discovered that the compound had immunosuppressive activity. They synthesised a chemical variant for increased activity and reduced adverse effects. They subsequently demonstrated that it was useful in organ transplantation in experimental rats. After successful clinical trials, the compound was approved for use in kidney transplant by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on 3 May 1995, and was sold under the brand name Cellcept. It was approved for use in the European Union in February 1996. == Names == It was initially introduced as the prodrug mycophenolate mofetil (MMF, brand name Cellcept) to improve oral bioavailability. The salt mycophenolate sodium has also been introduced. Enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) is an alternative MPA formulation. MMF and EC-MPS appear to be equal in benefits and safety. == Research == Mycophenolate mofetil is beginning to be used in the management of auto-immune disorders such as idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), scleroderma (systemic sclerosis or SSc), and pemphigus vulgaris (PV) with success for some patients. It is also being used as a long-term therapy for maintaining remission of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, though thus far, studies have found it inferior to azathioprine. A combination of mycophenolate and ribavirin has been found to stop infection by and replication of dengue virus in vitro. It has also shown promising antiviral activity against MERS, especially in combination with interferon. Preliminary data suggest that mycophenolate mofetil might have benefits in people with multiple sclerosis. However the evidence is insufficient to determine the effects as an add‐on therapy for interferon beta-1a in people with RRMS. == References ==",

         "Meclizine, sold under the brand name Bonine, among others, is an antihistamine used to treat motion sickness and dizziness (vertigo). It is taken by mouth. Effects generally begin in an hour and last for up to a day. Common side effects include sleepiness and dry mouth. Serious side effects may include allergic reactions. Use in pregnancy appears safe, but has not been well studied; use in breastfeeding is of unclear safety. It is believed to work in part by anticholinergic and antihistamine mechanisms. Meclizine was patented in 1951 and came into medical use in 1953. It is available as a generic medication and often over the counter. In 2022, it was the 129th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 4 million prescriptions. == Medical uses == Meclizine is used to treat symptoms of motion sickness. === Motion sickness === Meclizine is effective in inhibiting nausea, vomiting, and dizziness caused by motion sickness. The drug is safe for treating nausea in pregnancy and is a first-line therapy for this use. Meclizine may not be strong enough for especially sickening motion stimuli, and second-line defenses should be tried in those cases. === Vertigo === Meclizine may be used to treat vertigo, such as in those with Ménière's disease. == Side effects == Some common side effects such as drowsiness, dry mouth, and tiredness may occur. Meclizine has been shown to have fewer dry mouth side effects than the traditional treatment for motion sickness, transdermal scopolamine. A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is unlikely, but immediate medical attention should be sought if it occurs. Symptoms of a serious allergic reaction may include rash, itching, swelling, severe dizziness, and trouble breathing. == Pharmacology == === Pharmacodynamics === Meclizine is an antagonist at H1 receptors (Ki = 250 nM). It possesses anticholinergic, central nervous system depressant, and local anesthetic effects. Its antiemetic and antivertigo effects are not fully understood, but its central anticholinergic properties are partially responsible. The drug depresses labyrinth excitability and vestibular stimulation, and it may affect the medullary chemoreceptor trigger zone. The drug has been shown to reduce the magnitude of the vestibulo-ocular reflex in healthy volunteers. At the same time the drug was found to have only a small (and statistically insignificant) effect on the motion sensitivity of the utricles. Much as motion sickness arises from a discrepancy between multiple senses, meclizine most likely affects a wide array of sensory mechanisms related to self-motion while leaving the core vestibular response intact. Meclizine also has been reported to be a weak dopamine antagonist at D1-like and D2-like receptors but it does not cause catalepsy in mice, perhaps because of its anticholinergic activity. The drug does not effect dopamine or serotonin reuptake. === Pharmacokinetics === Meclizine reaches peak plasma concentration in about 1.5 hours and has an elimination half-life of 5–6 hours. Despite its relatively short half-life, the drug is reported to remain effective for motion sickness for 12 – 24 hours. Meclizine has low bioavailability (22–32%) and a delayed onset to action in part due to its poor solubility in water (0.1 mg/ml) and gastrointestinal fluid. In children it has been found that taking meclizine with food increases its bioavailability slightly. It is metabolized in the liver by the CYP2D6 enzyme. Ten metabolites have been identified. In rats, the main metabolite is norchlorcyclizine, which distributes extensively through body tissue. == Chemistry == Meclizine is a first-generation antihistamine (nonselective H1 antagonist) of the piperazine class. It is structurally and pharmacologically similar to buclizine, cyclizine, and hydroxyzine. === Synthesis === (4-Chlorophenyl)-phenylmethanol is halogenated with thionyl chloride before adding acetylpiperazine. The acetyl group is cleaved with diluted sulfuric acid. An N-alkylation of the piperazine ring with 3-methylbenzylchloride completes the synthesis. Alternatively, the last step can be replaced by a reductive N-alkylation with 3-methylbenzaldehyde. The reductive agent is hydrogen, and Raney nickel is used as a catalyst. Meclizine is obtained and used as a racemate, a 1:1 mixture of the two stereoisomers. Drug forms contain the racemic dihydrochloride. == Society and culture == === Brand names === Meclizine is an international nonproprietary name. It is sold under the brand names Bonine, Bonamine, Antivert, Postafen, Sea Legs, and Dramamine II (Less Drowsy Formulation). Emesafene is a combination of meclizine (1/3) and pyridoxine (2/3). In Canada, Antivert Tab was a combination of meclizine and nicotinic acid. == References ==",

         "α-Tocopheryl acetate (alpha-tocopherol acetate), also known as vitamin E acetate, is a form of vitamin E with D-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate as the natural form and DL-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate as the synthetic form. DL-indicates the synthetic form where as D- indicates the natural form. It is the ester of acetic acid and α-tocopherol. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that vitamin E acetate is a very strong culprit of concern in the 2019 outbreak of vaping-associated pulmonary injury (VAPI), but there is not yet sufficient evidence to rule out contributions from other chemicals. Vaporization of this ester produces toxic pyrolysis products. == Use in cosmetics == α-Tocopheryl acetate is often used in dermatological products such as skin creams. It is not oxidized and can penetrate through the skin to the living cells, where about 5% is converted to free tocopherol. Claims are made for beneficial antioxidant effects. α-Tocopheryl acetate is used as an alternative to tocopherol itself because the phenolic hydroxyl group is blocked, providing a less acidic product with a longer shelf life. It is believed that the acetate is slowly hydrolyzed after it is absorbed into the skin, regenerating tocopherol and providing protection against the sun's ultraviolet rays. Tocopheryl acetate was first synthesized in 1963 by workers at Hoffmann-La Roche. Although there is widespread use of tocopheryl acetate as a topical medication, with claims for improved wound healing and reduced scar tissue, reviews have repeatedly concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support these claims. There are reports of vitamin E-induced allergic contact dermatitis from use of vitamin E derivatives such as tocopheryl linoleate and tocopherol acetate in skin care products. Incidence is low despite widespread use. == Misuse == === Ingredient in vape liquids === On September 5, 2019, the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) announced that 10 out of 18, or 56% of the samples of vape liquids sent in by states, linked to the recent vaping-related lung disease outbreak in the United States, tested positive for vitamin E acetate which had been used as a thickening agent by illicit THC vape cartridge manufacturers. On November 8, 2019, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) identified vitamin E acetate as a very strong culprit of concern in the vaping-related illnesses, but has not ruled out other chemicals or toxicants as possible causes. The CDC's findings were based on fluid samples from the lungs of 29 patients with vaping-associated pulmonary injury, which provided direct evidence of vitamin E acetate at the primary site of injury in all the 29 lung fluid samples tested. Research suggests when vitamin E acetate is inhaled, it may interfere with normal lung functioning. A 2020 study found that vaporizing vitamin E acetate produced carcinogenic alkenes and benzene, but also exceptionally toxic ketene gas, which may be a contributing factor to the pulmonary injuries. == Chemistry == At room temperature, α-tocopheryl acetate is a fat-soluble liquid. It has 3 chiral centers and thus 8 stereoisomers. It is made by esterifying α-tocopherol with acetic acid. 2R,4R,8R-isomer, also known as RRR-α-tocopheryl acetate, is the most common isomer used for various purposes. This is because α-tocopherol occurs in nature primarily as RRR-α-tocopherol. α-Tocopherol acetate does not boil at atmospheric pressure and begins to degrade at 240 °C. It can be vacuum distilled: it boils at 184 °C at 0.01 mmHg, at 194 °C (0.025 mmHg) and at 224 °C (0.3 mmHg). In practice, it is not degraded notably by air, visible light or UV-radiation. It has a refractive index of 1.4950–1.4972 at 20 °C. α-Tocopherol acetate is hydrolyzed to α-tocopherol and acetic acid under suitable conditions or when ingested by people. == References ==",

         "Carbamazepine, sold under the brand name Tegretol among others, is an anticonvulsant medication used in the treatment of epilepsy and neuropathic pain. It is used as an adjunctive treatment in schizophrenia along with other medications and as a second-line agent in bipolar disorder. Carbamazepine appears to work as well as phenytoin and valproate for focal and generalized seizures. It is not effective for absence or myoclonic seizures. Carbamazepine was discovered in 1953 by Swiss chemist Walter Schindler. It was first marketed in 1962. It is available as a generic medication. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2020, it was the 185th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2 million prescriptions. Photoswitchable analogues of carbamazepine have been developed to control its pharmacological activity locally and on demand using light (photopharmacology), with the purpose of reducing the adverse systemic effects of the drug. One of these light-regulated compounds (carbadiazocine, based on a bridged azobenzene or diazocine) has been shown to produce analgesia with noninvasive illumination in vivo in a rat model of neuropathic pain. == Medical uses == Carbamazepine is typically used for the treatment of seizure disorders and neuropathic pain. It is used off-label as a second-line treatment for bipolar disorder and in combination with an antipsychotic in some cases of schizophrenia when treatment with a conventional antipsychotic alone has failed. However, evidence does not support its usage for schizophrenia. It is not effective for absence seizures or myoclonic seizures. Although carbamazepine may have a similar effectiveness (as measured by people continuing to use a medication) and efficacy (as measured by the medicine reducing seizure recurrence and improving remission) when compared to phenytoin and valproate, choice of medication should be evaluated on an individual basis as further research is needed to determine which medication is most helpful for people with newly-onset seizures. In the United States, carbamazepine is indicated for the treatment of epilepsy (including partial seizures, generalized tonic-clonic seizures and mixed seizures), and trigeminal neuralgia. Carbamazepine is the only medication that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia. As of 2014, a controlled release formulation was available for which there is tentative evidence showing fewer side effects and unclear evidence with regard to whether there is a difference in efficacy. It has also been shown to improve symptoms of \"typewriter tinnitus\", a type of tinnitus caused by the neurovascular compression of the cochleovestibular nerve. == Adverse effects == In the US, the label for carbamazepine contains warnings concerning: effects on the body's production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets: rarely, there are major effects of aplastic anemia and agranulocytosis reported and more commonly, there are minor changes such as decreased white blood cell or platelet counts, but these do not progress to more serious problems. increased risks of suicide increased risks of hyponatremia and SIADH risk of seizures, if the person stops taking the drug abruptly risks to the fetus in women who are pregnant, specifically congenital malformations like spina bifida, and developmental disorders. Pancreatitis Hepatitis Dizziness Bone marrow suppression Stevens–Johnson syndrome Common adverse effects may include drowsiness, dizziness, headaches and migraines, ataxia, nausea, vomiting, and/or constipation. Alcohol use while taking carbamazepine may lead to enhanced depression of the central nervous system. Less common side effects may include increased risk of seizures in people with mixed seizure disorders, abnormal heart rhythms, blurry or double vision. Also, rare case reports of an auditory side effect have been made, whereby patients perceive sounds about a semitone lower than previously; this unusual side effect is usually not noticed by most people, and disappears after the person stops taking carbamazepine. === Pharmacogenetics === Serious skin reactions such as Stevens–Johnson syndrome (SJS) or toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) due to carbamazepine therapy are more common in people with a particular human leukocyte antigen gene-variant (allele), HLA-B*1502. Odds ratios for the development of SJS or TEN in people who carry the allele can be in the double, triple or even quadruple digits, depending on the population studied. HLA-B*1502 occurs almost exclusively in people with ancestry across broad areas of Asia, but has a very low or absent frequency in European, Japanese, Korean and African populations. However, the HLA-A*31:01 allele has been shown to be a strong predictor of both mild and severe adverse reactions, such as the DRESS form of severe cutaneous reactions, to carbamazepine among Japanese, Chinese, Korean, and Europeans. It is suggested that carbamazepine acts as a potent antigen that binds to the antigen-presenting area of HLA-B*1502 alike, triggering an everlasting activation signal on immature CD8-T cells, thus resulting in widespread cytotoxic reactions like SJS/TEN. == Interactions == Carbamazepine has a potential for drug interactions. Drugs that decrease breaking down of carbamazepine or otherwise increase its levels include erythromycin, cimetidine, propoxyphene, and calcium channel blockers. Grapefruit juice raises the bioavailability of carbamazepine by inhibiting the enzyme CYP3A4 in the gut wall and in the liver. Lower levels of carbamazepine are seen when administered with phenobarbital, phenytoin, or primidone, which can result in breakthrough seizure activity. Valproic acid and valnoctamide both inhibit microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH), the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of the active metabolite carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide into inactive metabolites. By inhibiting mEH, valproic acid and valnoctamide cause a build-up of the active metabolite, prolonging the effects of carbamazepine and delaying its excretion. Carbamazepine, as an inducer of cytochrome P450 enzymes, may increase clearance of many drugs, decreasing their concentration in the blood to subtherapeutic levels and reducing their desired effects. Drugs that are more rapidly metabolized with carbamazepine include warfarin, lamotrigine, phenytoin, theophylline, valproic acid, many benzodiazepines, and methadone. Carbamazepine also increases the metabolism of the hormones in birth control pills and can reduce their effectiveness, potentially leading to unexpected pregnancies. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Carbamazepine is a sodium channel blocker. It binds preferentially to voltage-gated sodium channels in their inactive conformation, which prevents repetitive and sustained firing of an action potential. Carbamazepine has effects on serotonin systems but the relevance to its antiseizure effects is uncertain. There is evidence that it is a serotonin releasing agent and possibly even a serotonin reuptake inhibitor. It has been suggested that carbamazepine can also block voltage-gated calcium channels, which will reduce neurotransmitter release. === Pharmacokinetics === Carbamazepine is relatively slowly but practically completely absorbed after administration by mouth. Highest concentrations in the blood plasma are reached after 4 to 24 hours depending on the dosage form. Slow release tablets result in about 15% lower absorption and 25% lower peak plasma concentrations than ordinary tablets, as well as in less fluctuation of the concentration, but not in significantly lower minimum concentrations. In the circulation, carbamazepine itself comprises 20 to 30% of total residues. The remainder is in the form of metabolites; 70 to 80% of residues is bound to plasma proteins. Concentrations in breast milk are 25 to 60% of those in the blood plasma. Carbamazepine itself is not pharmacologically active. It is activated, mainly by CYP3A4, to carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide, which is solely responsible for the drug's anticonvulsant effects. The epoxide is then inactivated by microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEH) to carbamazepine-trans-10,11-diol and further to its glucuronides. Other metabolites include various hydroxyl derivatives and carbamazepine-N-glucuronide. The plasma half-life is about 35 to 40 hours when carbamazepine is given as single dose, but it is a strong inducer of liver enzymes, and the plasma half-life shortens to about 12 to 17 hours when it is given repeatedly. The half-life can be further shortened to 9–10 hours by other enzyme inducers such as phenytoin or phenobarbital. About 70% are excreted via the urine, almost exclusively in form of its metabolites, and 30% via the faeces. == History == Carbamazepine was discovered by chemist Walter Schindler at J.R. Geigy AG (now part of Novartis) in Basel, Switzerland, in 1953. It was first marketed as a drug to treat epilepsy in Switzerland in 1963 under the brand name Tegretol; its use for trigeminal neuralgia (formerly known as tic douloureux) was introduced at the same time. It has been used as an anticonvulsant and antiepileptic in the United Kingdom since 1965, and has been approved in the United States since 1968. Carbamazepine was studied for bipolar disorder throughout the 1970s. == Society and culture == === Environmental impact === Carbamazepine and its bio-transformation products have been detected in wastewater treatment plant effluent: 224 and in streams receiving treated wastewater. Field and laboratory studies have been conducted to understand the accumulation of carbamazepine in food plants grown in soil treated with sludge, which vary with respect to the concentrations of carbamazepine present in sludge and in the concentrations of sludge in the soil. Taking into account only studies that used concentrations commonly found in the environment, a 2014 review concluded that \"the accumulation of carbamazepine into plants grown in soil amended with biosolids poses a de minimis risk to human health according to the approach.\": 227 === Brand names === Carbamazepine is available worldwide under many brand names including Tegretol. == Research == == References == == Further reading == == External links == \"Carbamazepine\".

         "Curcumin is a bright yellow chemical produced by plants of the Curcuma longa species. It is the principal curcuminoid of turmeric (Curcuma longa), a member of the ginger family, Zingiberaceae. It is sold as a herbal supplement, cosmetics ingredient, food flavoring, and food coloring. Chemically, curcumin is a polyphenol, more particularly a diarylheptanoid, belonging to the group of curcuminoids, which are phenolic pigments responsible for the yellow color of turmeric. Laboratory and clinical research have not confirmed any medical use for curcumin. It is difficult to study because it is both unstable and poorly bioavailable. It is unlikely to produce useful leads for drug development as a lead compound. == History == Curcumin was named in 1815 when Henri Auguste Vogel and Pierre Joseph Pelletier reported the first isolation of a \"yellow coloring-matter\" from the rhizomes of turmeric. Later, it was found to be a mixture of resin and turmeric oil. In 1910, Milobedzka and Lampe reported the chemical structure of curcumin to be as diferuloylmethane. Later in 1913, the same group accomplished the synthesis of the compound. Although used in traditional medicine, the possible therapeutic properties of turmeric or curcumin remain undetermined. == Uses == The most common applications are as an ingredient in dietary supplement, in cosmetics, as flavoring for foods, such as turmeric-flavored beverages in South and Southeast Asia, and as coloring for foods, such as curry powders, mustards, butters, and cheeses. As a food additive for orange-yellow coloring in prepared foods, its E number is E 100 in the European Union. It is also approved by the U.S. FDA to be used as a food coloring in US. Curcumin is used as a complexometric indicator for boron. It reacts with boric acid to form a red-colored compound, rosocyanine. == Chemistry == Curcumin incorporates a seven carbon linker and three major functional groups: an α,β-unsaturated β-diketone moiety and an aromatic O-methoxy-phenolic group. The aromatic ring systems, which are phenols, are connected by two α,β-unsaturated carbonyl groups. It is a diketone tautomer, existing in enolic form in organic solvents and in keto form in water. The diketones form stable enols and are readily deprotonated to form enolates; the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl group is a good Michael acceptor and undergoes nucleophilic addition. Because of its hydrophobic nature, curcumin is poorly soluble in water but is easily soluble in organic solvents. === Biosynthesis === The biosynthetic route of curcumin is uncertain. In 1973, Peter J. Roughley and Donald A. Whiting proposed two mechanisms for curcumin biosynthesis. The first mechanism involves a chain extension reaction by cinnamic acid and 5 malonyl-CoA molecules that eventually arylize into a curcuminoid. The second mechanism involves two cinnamate units coupled together by malonyl-CoA. Both use cinnamic acid as their starting point, which is derived from the amino acid phenylalanine. Plant biosynthesis starting with cinnamic acid is rare compared to the more common p-coumaric acid. Only a few identified compounds, such as anigorufone and pinosylvin, build from cinnamic acid. == Pharmacology == Curcumin, which shows positive results in most drug discovery assays, is regarded as a false lead that medicinal chemists include among \"pan-assay interference compounds\". This attracts undue experimental attention while failing to advance as viable therapeutic or drug leads, although some derivatives of curcumin such as EF-24 have seen a significant amount of research. Factors that limit the bioactivity of curcumin or its analogs include chemical instability, water insolubility, absence of potent and selective target activity, low bioavailability, limited tissue distribution, and extensive metabolism. Very little curcumin escapes the GI tract and most is excreted in feces unchanged. If curcumin enters plasma in reasonable amounts, there is a high risk of toxicity since it is promiscuous, and interacts with several proteins known to increase the risk of adverse effects, including hERG, cytochrome P450s, and glutathione S-transferase. == Safety == As a component of turmeric, curcumin may interact with prescription drugs and dietary supplements. In high amounts, it may be unsafe for women during pregnancy. It may cause side effects, such as nausea, diarrhea, hives, or dizziness. Between 2004 and 2022 there were ten cases of liver injury caused by curcumin herbal and dietary supplements. Curcumin is a contact allergen. The intended use of curcumin as a food additive is generally recognized as safe by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. == Medical research == Although curcumin has been assessed in numerous laboratory and clinical studies, it has no medical uses established by well-designed clinical research. According to a 2017 review of more than 120 studies, curcumin has not been successful in any clinical trial, leading the authors to conclude that \"curcumin is an unstable, reactive, non-bioavailable compound and, therefore, a highly improbable lead\". Curcumin exhibits numerous interference properties which may lead to misinterpretation of results. The US government has supported US$150 million in research into curcumin through the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, and no support has been found for curcumin as a medical treatment. === Research fraud === Bharat Aggarwal, a former cancer researcher at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, had 29 papers retracted due to research fraud as of July 2021. Aggarwal's research had focused on potential anti-cancer properties of herbs and spices, particularly curcumin, and according to a March 2016 article in the Houston Chronicle, \"attracted national media interest and laid the groundwork for ongoing clinical trials\". Aggarwal cofounded a company in 2004 called Curry Pharmaceuticals based in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, which planned to develop drugs based on synthetic analogs of curcumin. SignPath Pharma, a company seeking to develop liposomal formulations of curcumin, licensed three patents by Aggarwal related to that approach from MD Anderson in 2013. == FDA warnings about dietary supplements == Between 2018 and 2023, the FDA issued 29 warning letters to American manufacturers of dietary supplements for making false claims of anti-disease effects from using products containing curcumin. In each letter, the FDA stated that the supplement product was not an approved new drug because the \"product is not generally recognized as safe and effective\" for the advertised uses, that \"new drugs may not be legally introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without prior approval from FDA\", and that the \"FDA approves a new drug on the basis of scientific data and information demonstrating that the drug is safe and effective\". == Alternative medicine == Though there is no evidence for the safety or efficacy of using curcumin as a therapy, some alternative medicine practitioners give it intravenously, supposedly as a treatment for numerous diseases. In 2017, two serious cases of adverse events were reported from curcumin or turmeric products—one severe allergic reaction and one death—that were caused by administration of a curcumin-polyethylene glycol (PEG40) emulsion product by a naturopath. One treatment caused anaphylaxis leading to death. == Stability == Decontamination of food by ionizing radiation, or food irradiation, is considered a safe and efficient process for elimination of pathogenic bacteria. Ionizing radiation treatment can be applied to either raw materials or ready to eat foods, with some countries, like the United States, imposing limitations on its use. In 2016, laboratory research established and compared the radiosensitivity of three organic food colorants including curcumin, carmine, and annatto to create data to be used for application whenever food products containing these food colors were to undergo the radiation process. The researchers used spectrophotometry and capillary electrophoresis to establish radiosensitivity of the three organic food colorants. Carmine samples were quite stable against radiation treatment, annatto showed limited stability, and curcumin was found to be unstable, particularly when diluted. == References == == External links == Curcumin (Curcuma, Turmeric) and Cancer (PDQ®)–Health Professional Version Medicines containing turmeric or curcumin, risk of liver injury, Safety advisory First draft statement on the potential risk to human health of turmeric and curcumin",

         "Forskolin (coleonol) is a labdane diterpene produced by the plant Coleus barbatus (blue spur flower). Other names include pashanabhedi, Indian coleus, makandi, HL-362, mao hou qiao rui hua. As with other members of the large diterpene class of plant metabolites, forskolin is derived from geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP). Forskolin contains some unique functional elements, including the presence of a tetrahydropyran-derived heterocyclic ring. Forskolin is commonly used in laboratory research to increase levels of cyclic AMP by stimulation of adenylate cyclase. == Mechanism of action == Forskolin is used in biochemistry experiments to raise levels of cyclic AMP (cAMP) in studies of cell physiology. Forskolin activates the enzyme adenylyl cyclase and increases intracellular levels of cAMP. cAMP is an important second messenger necessary for the proper biological response of cells to hormones and other extracellular signals. It is required for cell communication in the hypothalamus-pituitary gland axis, and for the feedback control of hormones via induction of corticotropin-releasing factor gene transcription. Cyclic AMP acts by activating cAMP-sensitive pathways such as protein kinase A and EPAC1. == Chemistry == It is defined as a category 4 chemical with acute dermal toxicity based on 2012 OSHA Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1910.1200). === Derivatives === Its derivatives include colforsin daropate, NKH477, and FSK88, which may be more potent than forskolin at raising cAMP. These derivatives may have pharmaceutical utility against bronchoconstriction and heart failure. === Chemical synthesis === A total chemical synthesis has been reported. The key step of this chemical synthesis is photocyclization of a synthetic intermediate in presence of oxygen and methylene blue, followed by a singlet oxygen Diels-Alder reaction. == Biosynthesis == The heterocyclic ring is synthesized after the formation of the trans-fused carbon ring systems formed by a carbocation mediated cyclization. The remaining tertiary carbocation is quenched by a molecule of water. After deprotonation, the remaining hydroxy group is free to form the heterocyclic ring. This cyclization can occur either by attack of the alcohol oxygen onto the allylic carbocation formed by loss of diphosphate, or by an analogous SN2'-like displacement of the diphosphate. This forms the core ring system A of forskolin. The remaining modifications of the core ring system A can putatively be understood as a series of oxidation reactions to form a poly-ol B which is then further oxidized and esterified to form the ketone and acetate ester moieties seen in forskolin. However, because the biosynthetic gene cluster has not been described, this putative synthesis could be incorrect in the sequence of oxidation/esterification events, which could occur in almost any order. == Weight loss == Although forskolin has been used in preliminary weight loss research, the low quality of the studies and inconclusive results prevented any determination of effects. == See also == Adenylyl cyclase Cyclic AMP == References == == External links == Hall, Harriet (2014-06-03). \"Forskolin: Here We Go Again\".

         " The identification of cancer biomarkers is critical for target-linked cancer therapy. The overall level of phosphatidylcholine (PC) is elevated in colorectal cancer (CRC). To investigate which species of PC is overexpressed in colorectal cancer, an imaging mass spectrometry was performed using a panel of non-neoplastic mucosal and CRC tissues. In the present study, we identified a novel biomarker, PC(16:0/16:1), in CRC using imaging mass spectrometry. Specifically, elevated levels of PC(16:0/16:1) expression were observed in the more advanced stage of CRC. Our data further showed that PC(16:0/16:1) was specifically localized in the cancer region when examined using imaging mass spectrometry. Notably, because the ratio of PC(16:0/16:1) to lyso-PC(16:0) was higher in CRC, we postulated that lyso-PC acyltransferase (LPCAT) activity is elevated in CRC. In an in vitro analysis, we showed that LPCAT4 is involved in the deregulation of PC(16:0/16:1) in CRC. In an immunohistochemical analysis, LPCAT4 was shown to be overexpressed in CRC. These data indicate the potential usefulness of PC(16:0/16:1) for the clinical diagnosis of CRC and implicate LPCAT4 in the elevated expression of PC(16:0/16:1) in CRC.",

         " MurNAc etherases cleave the unique D-lactyl ether bond of the bacterial cell wall sugar N-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc). Members of this newly discovered family of enzymes are widely distributed among bacteria and are required to utilize peptidoglycan fragments obtained either from the environment or from the endogenous cell wall (i.e., recycling). MurNAc etherases are strictly dependent on the substrate MurNAc possessing a free reducing end and a phosphoryl group at C6. They carry a single conserved sugar phosphate isomerase/sugar phosphate-binding (SIS) domain to which MurNAc 6-phosphate is bound. Two subunits form an enzymatically active homodimer that structurally resembles the isomerase module of the double-SIS domain protein GlmS, the glucosamine 6-phosphate synthase. Structural comparison provides insights into the two-step lyase-type reaction mechanism of MurNAc etherases: beta-elimination of the D-lactic acid substituent proceeds through a 2,3-unsaturated sugar intermediate to which water is subsequently added. This review covers recent developments in the inhibition of translocase MraY and related phospho-GlcNAc transferases WecA and TagO, and insight into the inhibition and catalytic mechanism of this class of integral membrane proteins from the structure of Aquifex aeolicus MraY. Recent studies have also identified a protein-protein interaction site in Escherichia coli MraY, that is targeted by bacteriophage ϕX174 lysis protein E, and also by cationic antimicrobial peptides containing Arg-Trp close to their N- or C-termini. Phospho-MurNAc-pentapeptide translocase (MraY, translocase I) catalyses the first step of the lipid-linked cycle of reactions of bacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis. MraY is the target for five families of nucleoside antibacterial natural products: the tunicamycins, the mureidomycins (also pacidamycins, napsamycins), the liposidomycins, the muraymycins, and the capuramycins. Recent structure-activity studies on these families have led to the identification of active pharmacophores, and insight into their mechanisms of action. This step of peptidoglycan biosynthesis is also the target for the bacteriolytic E protein from bacteriophage phiX174, and for cyclic peptides of the amphomycin family which complex the undecaprenyl phosphate co-substrate. The mechanisms of enzyme inhibition by these agents are discussed, and the state of knowledge regarding the transmembrane structure, active site, and catalytic mechanism of MraY. The availability of high throughput assays and prospects of MraY as an antibacterial target are also discussed.",

         " Although specific compounds found in some East Asian traditional medicines have been shown to exhibit bioactive properties, their molecular mechanisms of action remain elusive. The bark of the Alnus species has been used for the treatment of various pathological conditions including hemorrhage, alcoholism, fever, diarrhea, skin diseases, inflammation, and cancer in East Asia for centuries. In this study, we show that hirsutenone, a bioactive compound in Alnus japonica, exhibits anti-cancer effects against prostate cancer through a direct physical inhibition of Akt1/2. Hirsutenone suppressed anchorage-dependent and independent cell growth of PC3 and LNCaP human prostate cancer cells. Annexin V and Propidium iodide (PI) staining results demonstrated that hirsutenone strongly induces apoptotic cell death in both PC3 and LNCaP cells. Furthermore, treatment of hirsutenone attenuated phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a downstream substrate of Akt, without affecting Akt phosphorylation. Kinase and pull-down assay results clearly show that hirsutenone inhibits Akt1 and 2 by direct binding in an adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-noncompetitive manner in vitro and ex vivo. Our results show that hirsutenone suppresses human prostate cancer by targeting Akt1 and 2 as a key component to explain for anti-cancer activity of Alnus species. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether hirsutenone affects the human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) K(+) channels. Many drugs promote formation of the acquired form of long QT syndrome (LQTS) by blocking the hERG K(+) channels. Hirsutenone, a new candidate for the treatment inflammatory skin lesions, induced a concentration-dependent decrease in hERG K(+) current amplitudes. Hirsutenone significantly decreased the time constants at the onset of inactivation. However, the reductions in the time constants of steady-state inactivation and the recovery from inactivation after hirsutenone treatment were not significant. In addition, the drug had no effect on the voltage-dependent activation curve or the steady-state inactivation curve. In summary, hirsutenone potentially acts as a blocker of hERG K(+) channels functioning by modifying the channel inactivation kinetics. Adipogenesis is a key driver of the expansion of adipose tissue mass that causes obesity. Hirsutenone (HST) is an active botanical diarylheptanoid present in Alnus species. In this study, we evaluated the effects of HST on adipogenesis, its mechanisms of action and the molecular targets involved. Using Oil Red O staining, we observed that HST dose-dependently suppresses lipid accumulation during adipogenesis in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, concomitant with a decrease in peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ), CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα) and fatty acid synthase (FAS) protein expression. This inhibitory effect was largely limited to the early stage of adipogenesis, which includes mitotic clonal expansion (MCE), as evidenced by delayed cell cycle entry of preadipocytes from G1 to S phase. Furthermore, the regulation of MCE was accompanied by suppression of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) activity. HST was also shown to bind directly to PI3K and ERK1 in a non-ATP competitive manner. Our results suggest that HST attenuates adipogenesis by directly targeting PI3K and ERK during MCE in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes, underscoring the potential therapeutic application of HST in preventing obesity.",

Although noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and diabetes are among the top 10 global causes of death, they can be prevented by risk factor reduction, early detection, and adequate treatment. Since a healthy diet along with dietary supplementation could play an important role to reduce morbidity and cut off its associated health care costs, research in the food and nutrition area is required to find solutions to global challenges affecting health. As a result of the healthy living trend, dietary supplements category is growing fast, leading to an urgent need for dietitians, physicians, and policy makers to broaden the scientific evidence on the efficacy and safety of a wide range of active ingredients. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), as the third most consumed dietary supplement, and as a potential candidate for the treatment of various noncommunicable diseases that are among the global top 10 causes of death, has gained interest over years. Scientific evidence regarding mainly CoQ10 efficacy and safety, as well as formulation challenges, is addressed in this review. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) or ubiquinone was known for its key role in mitochondrial bioenergetics as electron and proton carrier; later studies demonstrated its presence in other cellular membranes and in blood plasma, and extensively investigated its antioxidant role. These two functions constitute the basis for supporting the clinical indication of CoQ10. Furthermore, recent data indicate that CoQ10 affects expression of genes involved in human cell signalling, metabolism and transport and some of the effects of CoQ10 supplementation may be due to this property. CoQ10 deficiencies are due to autosomal recessive mutations, mitochondrial diseases, ageing-related oxidative stress and carcinogenesis processes, and also a secondary effect of statin treatment. Many neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, cancer, fibromyalgia, muscular and cardiovascular diseases have been associated with low CoQ10 levels. CoQ10 treatment does not cause serious adverse effects in humans and new formulations have been developed that increase CoQ10 absorption and tissue distribution. Oral CoQ10 treatment is a frequent mitochondrial energizer and antioxidant strategy in many diseases that may provide a significant symptomatic benefit. Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) has a number of vital functions in all cells, both mitochondrial and extramitochondrial. In addition to its key role in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, CoQ10 serves as a lipid soluble antioxidant, plays an important role in fatty acid, pyrimidine and lysosomal metabolism, as well as directly mediating the expression of a number of genes, including those involved in inflammation. In view of the central role of CoQ10 in cellular metabolism, it is unsurprising that a CoQ10 deficiency is linked to the pathogenesis of a range of disorders. CoQ10 deficiency is broadly classified into primary or secondary deficiencies. Primary deficiencies result from genetic defects in the multi-step biochemical pathway of CoQ10 synthesis, whereas secondary deficiencies can occur as result of other diseases or certain pharmacotherapies. In this article we have reviewed the clinical consequences of primary and secondary CoQ10 deficiencies, as well as providing some examples of the successful use of CoQ10 supplementation in the treatment of disease.",

         "Cholic acid, also known as 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic acid is a primary bile acid that is insoluble in water (soluble in alcohol and acetic acid), it is a white crystalline substance. Salts of cholic acid are called cholates. Cholic acid, along with chenodeoxycholic acid, is one of the two major bile acids produced by the liver, where it is synthesized from cholesterol. These two major bile acids are roughly equal in concentration in humans. Derivatives are made from cholyl-CoA, which exchanges its CoA with either glycine, or taurine, yielding glycocholic and taurocholic acid, respectively. Cholic acid downregulates cholesterol-7-α-hydroxylase (rate-limiting step in bile acid synthesis), and cholesterol does the opposite. This is why chenodeoxycholic acid, and not cholic acid, can be used to treat gallstones (because decreasing bile acid synthesis would supersaturate the stones even more). Cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid are the most important human bile acids. Other species may synthesize different bile acids as their predominant primary bile acids. == Medical uses == Cholic acid, sold under the brand name Cholbam, is approved for use in the United States and is indicated as a treatment for children and adults with bile acid synthesis disorders due to single enzyme defects, and for peroxisomal disorders such as Zellweger syndrome. It was approved for use in the European Union in September 2013, and is sold under the brand name Orphacol. It is indicated for the treatment of inborn errors in primary bile-acid synthesis due to 3β-hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase deficiency or Δ4-3-oxosteroid-5β-reductase deficiency in infants, children and adolescents aged one month to 18 years and adults. Cholic acid FGK (Kolbam) was approved for medical use in the European Union in November 2015. It is indicated for the treatment of inborn errors of primary bile acid synthesis, in infants from one month of age for continuous lifelong treatment through adulthood, encompassing the following single enzyme defects: sterol 27-hydroxylase deficiency (presenting as cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, CTX); 2- (or alpha-) methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) deficiency; cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1) deficiency. The most common side effects include peripheral neuropathy (nerve damage in the hands and feet), diarrhea, nausea (feeling sick), acid reflux (stomach acid flowing up into the mouth), esophagitis (inflammation of the food pipe), jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), skin problems (lesions) and malaise (feeling unwell). == Cancer == A meta-analysis on the relationship of fecal bile acid concentrations to the development and progression of colorectal cancer was reported in 2025. It was found that higher fecal concentrations of cholic acid are associated with a higher risk/incidence of colorectal cancer. Bile acids have been implicated as carcinogens in the gastrointestinal tract. == Interactive pathway map == Click on genes, proteins and metabolites below to link to respective articles. == References ==",

         "Xanthohumol is a natural product found in the female inflorescences of Humulus lupulus, also known as hops. This compound is also found in beer and belongs to a class of compounds that contribute to the bitterness and flavor of hops. Xanthohumol is a prenylated chalconoid, biosynthesized by a type III polyketide synthase (PKS) and subsequent modifying enzymes. == Biosynthesis == Xanthohumol is a prenylated chalconoid derived from a plant type III PKS, and is synthesized in the glandular trichromes of hop cones. L-Phenylalanine serves as the starting material, which is converted to cinnamic acid by the PLP-dependent phenylalanine ammonia lyase. Cinnamic acid is oxidized by cinnamate-4-hydroxylase and loaded onto coenzyme A (CoA) by 4-coumarate CoA ligase to yield 4-hydroxy-cinnamoyl CoA, the starter unit for PKS extension. This molecule is extended three times with malonyl CoA, cyclized through a Claisen condensation, and aromatized through tautomerization to form naringenin chalcone (chalconaringenin). This intermediate has the potential to form a variety of different products depending on the enzymes that modify the core structure. In the case of xanthohumol, a prenyltransferase called Humulus lupulus prenyltransferase 1 (HlPT-1) attaches a molecule of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate from the DXP pathway. HlPT-1 has a broad substrate specificity and also participates in making other prenylated flavonoids in the hop plant. Finally, an O-methyltransferase methylates a phenol substituent using S-adenosyl methionine. Total syntheses of xanthohumol and derivatives have been achieved, though extraction from hops remains a primary source. == Beer == In commercial beers, the concentration of xanthohumol ranges from about 2 μg/L – 1.2 mg/L. During the brewing process, xanthohumol and other prenylated flavonoids are lost as they are converted to the corresponding flavanones. Different hop varieties and different beers contain varying quantities of xanthohumol. == Research == Xanthohumol is under basic research for its potential biological properties. Xanthohumol can be extracted with pressurized hot water. == See also == Isoxanthohumol, the corresponding prenylated flavanone 8-Prenylnaringenin, a related prenylflavanoid with estrogenic activity Alpha acids, a class of bitter compounds in hops Myrcene, humulene, and caryophyllene, essential oils in hops == References ==",

         "Enoxolone (INN, BAN; also known as glycyrrhetinic acid or glycyrrhetic acid) is a pentacyclic triterpenoid derivative of the beta-amyrin type obtained from the hydrolysis of glycyrrhizic acid, which was obtained from the herb liquorice. The substance has a sweet taste, so it is used in flavoring to mask the bitter taste of drugs like aloe and quinine. It may have some anti-inflammatory activities. One of its metabolites is responsible for the blood pressure-increasing effect of liquorice. == Medical uses == === Oral topical === In Turkey, enoxolone is used in a \"Anzibel\" lozenge in combination with benzocaine (a local anesthetic) and chlorhexidine hydrochloride (an antibacterial). It is found in an over-the-counter \"Arthrodont\" toothpaste. Evidence for the ingredient's usefulness for plaque and gingivitis is lacking. === Skin topical === In Japan, enoxolone is found in the \"Salonpas\" pain-relief menthol patch. It is also used in the Singaporean \"Vetic\" cream. In the United States, it is found in PruClair, a \"precription medical device\" indicated for generic dermatoses. === Possible other uses === Enoxolone is effective in the treatment of peptic ulcer and also has expectorant (antitussive) properties. It has some additional pharmacological properties with possible antiviral, antifungal, antiprotozoal, and antibacterial activities. == Mechanism of action == === Anti-inflammatory === Glycyrrhetinic acid inhibits the enzymes (15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase and delta-13-prostaglandin reductase) that metabolize the prostaglandins PGE-2 and PGF-2α to their respective, inactive 15-keto-13,14-dihydro metabolites. This increases prostaglandins in the digestive system. Prostaglandins inhibit gastric secretion, stimulate pancreatic secretion and mucous secretion in the intestines, and markedly increase intestinal motility. They also cause cell proliferation in the stomach. The effect on gastric acid secretion, and promotion of mucous secretion and cell proliferation shows why licorice has potential in treating peptic ulcers. Licorice should not be taken during pregnancy, because PGF-2α stimulates activity of the uterus during pregnancy and can cause abortion. ds The structure of glycyrrhetinic acid is similar to that of cortisone. Both molecules are flat and similar at positions 3 and 11. This might be the basis for licorice's anti-inflammatory action. === Hypertensive === 3-β-D-(Monoglucuronyl)-18-β-glycyrrhetinic acid, a metabolite of glycyrrhetinic acid, inhibits the conversion of 'active' cortisol to 'inactive' cortisone in the kidneys. This occurs via inhibition of the enzyme 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. As a result, cortisol levels become high within the collecting duct of the kidney. Cortisol has intrinsic mineralocorticoid properties (that is, it acts like aldosterone and increases sodium reabsorption) that work on ENaC channels in the collecting duct. Hypertension develops due to this mechanism of sodium retention. People often have high blood pressure with a low renin and low aldosterone blood level. The increased amounts of cortisol binds to the unprotected, nonspecific mineralocorticoid receptors and induce sodium and fluid retention, hypokalaemia, high blood pressure, and inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. Therefore, licorice should not be given to patients with a known history of hypertension in doses sufficient to inhibit 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. == Derivatives == In glycyrrhetinic acid, the functional group (R) is a hydroxyl group. Research in 2005 demonstrated that with a proper functional group a very effective glycyrrhetinic artificial sweetener can be obtained. When R is an anionic NHCO(CH2)CO2K side chain, the sweetening effect is found to be 1200 times that of sugar (human sensory panel data). A shorter or longer spacer reduces the sweetening effect. One explanation is that the taste bud cell receptor has 1.3 nanometers (13 angstroms) available for docking with the sweetener molecule. In addition, the sweetener molecule requires three proton donor positions, of which two reside at the extremities, to be able to interact efficiently with the receptor cavity. A synthetic analog, carbenoxolone, was developed in Britain. Both glycyrrhetinic acid and carbenoxolone have a modulatory effect on neural signaling through gap junction channels. Acetoxolone, the acetyl derivative of glycyrrhetinic acid, is a drug used in the treatment of peptic ulcer and gastroesophageal reflux disease. == See also == 11α-Hydroxyprogesterone == References == == Further reading == Saponin Glycosides Archived 2021-01-26 at the Wayback Machine, by Georges-Louis Friedli, URL accessed Sept 2010. == External links == Media related to Enoxolone at Wikimedia Commons",

         "('Acarbose',)",
         "Acarbose (INN) is an anti-diabetic drug used to treat diabetes mellitus type 2 and, in some countries, prediabetes. It is a generic sold in Europe and China as Glucobay (Bayer AG), in North America as Precose (Bayer Pharmaceuticals), and in Canada as Prandase (Bayer AG). Acarbose is a starch blocker. It works by inhibiting alpha glucosidase, an intestinal enzyme that releases glucose from larger carbohydrates such as starch and sucrose. It is composed of an acarviosin moiety with a maltose at the reducing terminus. It can be degraded by a number of gut bacteria. Acarbose is cheap and popular in China, but not in the U.S. One physician explains that use in the U.S. is limited because it is not potent enough to justify the side effects of diarrhea and flatulence. However, a large study concluded in 2013 that \"acarbose is effective, safe and well tolerated in a large cohort of Asian patients with type 2 diabetes.\" A possible explanation for the differing opinions is an observation that acarbose is significantly more effective in patients eating a relatively high-starch Eastern diet. == Medical uses == === Efficacy === In type II diabetic patients, acarbose averages an absolute decrease of 0.8 percentage points in HbA1c, which is a decrease of about 10% in typical HbA1c values in diabetes studies. Individuals with higher baseline levels show higher reductions, about an 0.12% additional decrease for each point of baseline HbA1c. Its effect on postprandial glucose, but not on HbA1c, scales with dose. Among diabetic patients, acarbose may help reduce the damage done to blood vessels and kidneys by reducing glucose levels. A Cochrane systematic review assessed the effect of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors in people with prediabetes, defined as impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting blood glucose, elevated glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). It was found that acarbose reduced the incidence of diabetes mellitus type 2 when compared to placebo, however there was no conclusive evidence that acarbose, when compared to diet and exercise, metformin, placebo, or no intervention, improved all-cause mortality, reduced or increased risk of cardiovascular mortality, serious or non-serious adverse events, non-fatal stroke, congestive heart failure, or non-fatal myocardial infarction. Several studies showed that glucosidase inhibitors and alpha-amylase inhibitors promote loss of visceral fat and waist by acting as calorie restriction mimetics (linked to its acarbose-like action). === Combination therapy === The combination of acarbose with metformin results in greater reductions of HbA1c, fasting blood glucose and post-prandial glucose than either agent alone. == Adverse effects == Since acarbose prevents the degradation of complex carbohydrates into glucose, some carbohydrate will remain in the intestine and be delivered to the colon. In the colon, bacteria digest (ferment) the complex carbohydrates, causing gastrointestinal side-effects such as flatulence (78% of patients) and diarrhea (14% of patients). Since these effects are dose-related, in general it is advised to start with a low dose and gradually increase the dose to the desired amount. One study found that gastrointestinal side effects decreased significantly (from 50% to 15%) over 24 weeks, even on constant dosing. Sucrose is more likely to trigger GI side effects compared to starch. Acarbose is associated with very rare elevated transaminases (19 out of 500,000). Even rarer cases of hepatitis has been reported with acarbose use. It usually goes away when the medicine is stopped. Liver enzymes should be checked before and during use of this medicine as a precaution. A 2016 meta-analysis confirms that alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, including acarbose, have a statistically significant link to elevated transaminase levels. == Pharmacology == === Mechanism of action === Acarbose inhibits enzymes (glycoside hydrolases) needed to digest carbohydrates, specifically, alpha-glucosidase enzymes in the brush border of the small intestines, and pancreatic alpha-amylase. It locks up the enzymes by mimicking the transition state of the substrate with its amine linkage. However, bacterial alpha-amylases from gut microbiome are able to degrade acarbose. Pancreatic alpha-amylase hydrolyzes complex starches to oligosaccharides in the lumen of the small intestine, whereas the membrane-bound intestinal alpha-glucosidases hydrolyze oligosaccharides, trisaccharides, and disaccharides to glucose and other monosaccharides in the small intestine. Inhibition of these enzyme systems reduces the rate of digestion of complex carbohydrates. Less glucose is absorbed because the carbohydrates are not broken down into glucose molecules. In diabetic patients, the short-term effect of these drug therapies is to decrease current blood glucose levels; the long-term effect is a reduction in HbA1c level. === Metabolism === Acarbose degradation is the unique feature of glycoside hydrolases in gut microbiota, acarbose degrading glucosidase, which hydrolyze acarbose into an acarviosine-glucose and glucose. Human enzymes do transform acarbose: the pancreatic alpha-amylase is able to perform a rearrangement reaction, moving the glucose unit in the \"tail\" maltose to the \"head\" of the molecule. Analog drugs with the \"tail\" glucose removed or flipped to an α(1-6) linkage resist this transformation. It has been reported that the maltogenic alpha-amylase from Thermus sp. IM6501 (ThMA) and a cyclodextrinase (CDase) from Streptococcus pyogenes could hydrolyse acarbose to glucose and acarviosine-glucose, ThMA can further hydrolyze acarviosine-glucose into acarviosin and glucose. A cyclomaltodextrinase (CDase) from gut bacteria Lactobacillus plantarum degraded acarbose via two different modes of action to produce maltose and acarviosin, as well as glucose and acarviosine-glucose, suggest that acarbose resistance is caused by the human microbiome. The microbiome-derived acarbose kinases are also specific to phosphorylate and inactivate acarbose. The molecular modeling showed the interaction between gut bacterial acarbose degrading glucosidase and human α-amylase. == Natural distribution == In nature, acarbose is synthesized by soil bacteria Actinoplanes sp through its precursor valienamine. And acarbose is also degraded by gut bacteria Lactobacillus plantarum and soil bacteria Thermus sp by acarbose degrading glucosidases. == In molecular biology == Acarbose is described chemically as a pseudotetrasaccharide, specifically a maltotetraose mimic inhibitor. As an inhibitor that mimics some natural substrates, it is useful for elucidating the structure of sugar-digesting enzymes, by binding into the same pocket. == Research == Most studies investigating alpha-glucosidase and alpha-amylase inhibitory activity use acarbose as reference. In human T2DM patients, acarbose reduces total triglyceride levels. Acarbose has a similar effect in non-T2DM patients with isolated familial hypertriglyceridemia. In smaller samples of healthy human volunteers, acarbose increases postprandial GLP-1 levels. In studies conducted by three independent laboratories by the US National Institute on Aging's intervention testing programme, acarbose was shown to extend the lifespan of female mice by 5% and of male mice by 22%. == References ==",

         "Astaxanthin is a keto-carotenoid within a group of chemical compounds known as carotenoids or terpenes. Astaxanthin is a metabolite of zeaxanthin and canthaxanthin, containing both hydroxyl and ketone functional groups. It is a lipid-soluble pigment with red coloring properties, which result from the extended chain of conjugated (alternating double and single) double bonds at the center of the compound. The presence of the hydroxyl functional groups and the hydrophobic hydrocarbons render the molecule amphiphilic. Astaxanthin is produced naturally in the freshwater microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis, the yeast fungus Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous (also known as Phaffia rhodozyma) and the bacteria Paracoccus carotinifaciens. When the algae are stressed by lack of nutrients, increased salinity, or excessive sunshine, they create astaxanthin. Animals who feed on the algae, such as salmon, red trout, red sea bream, flamingos, and crustaceans (shrimp, krill, crab, lobster, and crayfish), subsequently reflect the red-orange astaxanthin pigmentation. Astaxanthin is used as a dietary supplement for human, animal, and aquaculture consumption. Astaxanthin from algae, synthetic and bacterial sources is generally recognized as safe in the United States. The US Food and Drug Administration has approved astaxanthin as a food coloring (or color additive) for specific uses in animal and fish foods. The European Commission considers it as a food dye with E number E161j. The European Food Safety Authority has set an Acceptable Daily Intake of 0.2 mg per kg body weight, as of 2019. As a food color additive, astaxanthin and astaxanthin dimethyldisuccinate are restricted for use in Salmonid fish feed only. == Natural sources == Astaxanthin is present in most red-coloured aquatic organisms. The content varies from species to species, but also from individual to individual as it is highly dependent on diet and living conditions. Astaxanthin and other chemically related asta-carotenoids have also been found in a number of lichen species of the Arctic zone. The primary natural sources for industrial production of astaxanthin comprise the following: Euphausia pacifica (Pacific krill) Euphausia superba (Antarctic krill) Haematococcus pluvialis (algae) Pandalus borealis (Arctic shrimp) Astaxanthin concentrations in nature are approximately: Algae are the primary natural source of astaxanthin in the aquatic food chain. The microalgae Haematococcus pluvialis contains high levels of astaxanthin (about 3.8% of dry weight), and is the primary industrial source of natural astaxanthin. In shellfish, astaxanthin is almost exclusively concentrated in the shells, with only low amounts in the flesh itself, and most of it only becomes visible during cooking as the pigment separates from the denatured proteins that otherwise bind it. Astaxanthin is extracted from Euphausia superba (Antarctic krill) and from shrimp processing waste. == Biosynthesis == Astaxanthin biosynthesis starts with three molecules of isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) and one molecule of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) that are combined by IPP isomerase and converted to geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) by GGPP synthase. Two molecules of GGPP are then coupled by phytoene synthase to form phytoene. Next, phytoene desaturase creates four double bonds in the phytoene molecule to form lycopene. After desaturation, lycopene cyclase first forms γ-carotene by converting one of the ψ acyclic ends of the lycopene as a β-ring, then subsequently converts the other to form β-carotene. From β-carotene, hydrolases (blue) are responsible for the inclusion of two 3-hydroxy groups, and ketolases (green) for the addition of two 4-keto groups, forming multiple intermediate molecules until the final molecule, astaxanthin, is obtained. == Synthetic sources == The structure of astaxanthin by synthesis was described in 1975. Nearly all commercially available astaxanthin for aquaculture is produced synthetically, with an annual market of about $1 billion in 2019. An efficient synthesis from isophorone, cis-3-methyl-2-penten-4-yn-1-ol and a symmetrical C10-dialdehyde has been discovered and is used in industrial production. It combines these chemicals together with an ethynylation and then a Wittig reaction. Two equivalents of the proper ylide combined with the proper dialdehyde in a solvent of methanol, ethanol, or a mixture of the two, yields astaxanthin in up to 88% yields. == Metabolic engineering == The cost of astaxanthin extraction, high market price, and lack of efficient fermentation production systems, combined with the intricacies of chemical synthesis, discourage its commercial development. The metabolic engineering of bacteria (Escherichia coli) enables efficient astaxanthin production from beta-carotene via either zeaxanthin or canthaxanthin. == Structure == === Stereoisomers === In addition to structural isomeric configurations, astaxanthin also contains two chiral centers at the 3- and 3′-positions, resulting in three unique stereoisomers (3R,3′R and 3R,3'S meso and 3S,3'S). While all three stereoisomers are present in nature, relative distribution varies considerably from one organism to another. Synthetic astaxanthin contains a mixture of all three stereoisomers, in approximately 1:2:1 proportions. === Esterification === Astaxanthin exists in two predominant forms, non-esterified (yeast, synthetic) or esterified (algal) with various length fatty acid moieties whose composition is influenced by the source organism as well as growth conditions. The astaxanthin fed to salmon to enhance flesh coloration is in the non-esterified form The predominance of evidence supports a de-esterification of fatty acids from the astaxanthin molecule in the intestine prior to or concomitant with absorption resulting in the circulation and tissue deposition of non-esterified astaxanthin. European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) published a scientific opinion on a similar xanthophyll carotenoid, lutein, stating that \"following passage through the gastrointestinal tract and/or uptake lutein esters are hydrolyzed to form free lutein again\". While it can be assumed that non-esterified astaxanthin would be more bioavailable than esterified astaxanthin due to the extra enzymatic steps in the intestine needed to hydrolyse the fatty acid components, several studies suggest that bioavailability is more dependent on formulation than configuration. == Uses == Astaxanthin is used as a dietary supplement and feed supplement as food colorant for salmon, crabs, shrimp, chickens and egg production. === For seafood and animals === The primary use of synthetic astaxanthin today is as an animal feed additive to impart coloration, including farm-raised salmon and chicken egg yolks. Synthetic carotenoid pigments colored yellow, red or orange represent about 15–25% of the cost of production of commercial salmon feed. In the 21st century, most commercial astaxanthin for aquaculture is produced synthetically. Class action lawsuits were filed against some major grocery store chains for not clearly labeling the astaxanthin-treated salmon as \"color added\". The chains followed up quickly by labeling all such salmon as \"color added\". Litigation persisted with the suit for damages, but a Seattle judge dismissed the case, ruling that enforcement of the applicable food laws was up to government and not individuals. === Dietary supplement === The primary human application for astaxanthin is as a dietary supplement, and it remains under preliminary research. In 2020, the European Food Safety Authority reported that an intake of 8 mg astaxanthin per day from food supplements is safe for adults. == Role in the food chain == Lobsters, shrimp, and some crabs turn red when cooked because the astaxanthin, which was bound to the protein in the shell, becomes free as the protein denatures and unwinds. The freed pigment is thus available to absorb light and produce the red color. == Regulations == In April 2009, the United States Food and Drug Administration approved astaxanthin as an additive for fish feed only as a component of a stabilized color additive mixture. Color additive mixtures for fish feed made with astaxanthin may contain only those diluents that are suitable. The color additives astaxanthin, ultramarine blue, canthaxanthin, synthetic iron oxide, dried algae meal, Tagetes meal and extract, and corn endosperm oil are approved for specific uses in animal foods. Haematococcus algae meal (21 CFR 73.185) and Phaffia yeast (21 CFR 73.355) for use in fish feed to color salmonoids were added in 2000. In the European Union, astaxanthin-containing food supplements derived from sources that have no history of use as a source of food in Europe, fall under the remit of the Novel Food legislation, EC (No.) 258/97. Since 1997, there have been five novel food applications concerning products that contain astaxanthin extracted from these novel sources. In each case, these applications have been simplified or substantial equivalence applications, because astaxanthin is recognised as a food component in the EU diet. == References ==",

         "Tryptophan (symbol Trp or W) is an α-amino acid that is used in the biosynthesis of proteins. Tryptophan contains an α-amino group, an α-carboxylic acid group, and a side chain indole, making it a polar molecule with a non-polar aromatic beta carbon substituent. Tryptophan is also a precursor to the neurotransmitter serotonin, the hormone melatonin, and vitamin B3 (niacin). It is encoded by the codon UGG. Like other amino acids, tryptophan is a zwitterion at physiological pH where the amino group is protonated (–NH+3; pKa = 9.39) and the carboxylic acid is deprotonated ( –COO−; pKa = 2.38). Humans and many animals cannot synthesize tryptophan: they need to obtain it through their diet, making it an essential amino acid. Tryptophan is named after the digestive enzymes trypsin, which were used in its first isolation from casein proteins. It was assigned the one-letter symbol W based on the double ring being visually suggestive to the bulky letter. == Function == Amino acids, including tryptophan, are used as building blocks in protein biosynthesis, and proteins are required to sustain life. Tryptophan is among the less common amino acids found in proteins, but it plays important structural or functional roles whenever it occurs. For instance, tryptophan and tyrosine residues play special roles in \"anchoring\" membrane proteins within the cell membrane. Tryptophan, along with other aromatic amino acids, is also important in glycan-protein interactions. In addition, tryptophan functions as a biochemical precursor for the following compounds: Serotonin (a neurotransmitter), synthesized by tryptophan hydroxylase. Melatonin (a neurohormone) is in turn synthesized from serotonin, via N-acetyltransferase and 5-hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase enzymes. Kynurenine, to which tryptophan is mainly (more than 95%) metabolized. Two enzymes, namely indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in the immune system and the brain, and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) in the liver, are responsible for the synthesis of kynurenine from tryptophan. The kynurenine pathway of tryptophan catabolism is altered in several diseases, including psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, and bipolar disorder. Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is synthesized from tryptophan via kynurenine and quinolinic acids. Auxins (a class of phytohormones) are synthesized from tryptophan. The disorder fructose malabsorption causes improper absorption of tryptophan in the intestine, reduced levels of tryptophan in the blood, and depression. In bacteria that synthesize tryptophan, high cellular levels of this amino acid activate a repressor protein, which binds to the trp operon. Binding of this repressor to the tryptophan operon prevents transcription of downstream DNA that codes for the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of tryptophan. So high levels of tryptophan prevent tryptophan synthesis through a negative feedback loop, and when the cell's tryptophan levels go down again, transcription from the trp operon resumes. This permits tightly regulated and rapid responses to changes in the cell's internal and external tryptophan levels. == Recommended dietary allowance == In 2002, the U.S. Institute of Medicine set a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) of 5 mg/kg body weight/day of tryptophan for adults 19 years and over. === Dietary sources === Tryptophan is present in most protein-based foods or dietary proteins. It is particularly plentiful in chocolate, oats, dried dates, milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, red meat, eggs, fish, poultry, sesame, chickpeas, almonds, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, hemp seeds, buckwheat, spirulina, and peanuts. Contrary to the popular belief that cooked turkey contains an abundance of tryptophan, the tryptophan content in turkey is typical of poultry. == Medical use == === Depression === Because tryptophan is converted into 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) which is then converted into the neurotransmitter serotonin, it has been proposed that consumption of tryptophan or 5-HTP may improve depression symptoms by increasing the level of serotonin in the brain. Tryptophan is sold over the counter in the United States (after being banned to varying extents between 1989 and 2005) and the United Kingdom as a dietary supplement for use as an antidepressant, anxiolytic, and sleep aid. It is also marketed as a prescription drug in some European countries for the treatment of major depression. There is evidence that blood tryptophan levels are unlikely to be altered by changing the diet, but consuming purified tryptophan increases the serotonin level in the brain, whereas eating foods containing tryptophan does not. In 2001 a Cochrane review of the effect of 5-HTP and tryptophan on depression was published. The authors included only studies of a high rigor and included both 5-HTP and tryptophan in their review because of the limited data on either. Of 108 studies of 5-HTP and tryptophan on depression published between 1966 and 2000, only two met the authors' quality standards for inclusion, totaling 64 study participants. The substances were more effective than placebo in the two studies included but the authors state that \"the evidence was of insufficient quality to be conclusive\" and note that \"because alternative antidepressants exist which have been proven to be effective and safe, the clinical usefulness of 5-HTP and tryptophan is limited at present\". The use of tryptophan as an adjunctive therapy in addition to standard treatment for mood and anxiety disorders is not supported by the scientific evidence. === Insomnia === The American Academy of Sleep Medicine's 2017 clinical practice guidelines recommended against the use of tryptophan in the treatment of insomnia due to poor effectiveness. == Side effects == Potential side effects of tryptophan supplementation include nausea, diarrhea, drowsiness, lightheadedness, headache, dry mouth, blurred vision, sedation, euphoria, and nystagmus (involuntary eye movements). == Interactions == Tryptophan taken as a dietary supplement (such as in tablet form) has the potential to cause serotonin syndrome when combined with antidepressants of the MAOI or SSRI class or other strongly serotonergic drugs. Because tryptophan supplementation has not been thoroughly studied in a clinical setting, its interactions with other drugs are not well known. == Isolation == The isolation of tryptophan was first reported by Frederick Hopkins in 1901. Hopkins recovered tryptophan from hydrolysed casein, recovering 4–8 g of tryptophan from 600 g of crude casein. == Biosynthesis and industrial production == As an essential amino acid, tryptophan is not synthesized from simpler substances in humans and other animals, so it needs to be present in the diet in the form of tryptophan-containing proteins. Plants and microorganisms commonly synthesize tryptophan from shikimic acid or anthranilate: anthranilate condenses with phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP), generating pyrophosphate as a by-product. The ring of the ribose moiety is opened and subjected to reductive decarboxylation, producing indole-3-glycerol phosphate; this, in turn, is transformed into indole. In the last step, tryptophan synthase catalyzes the formation of tryptophan from indole and the amino acid serine. The industrial production of tryptophan is also biosynthetic and is based on the fermentation of serine and indole using either wild-type or genetically modified bacteria such as B. amyloliquefaciens, B. subtilis, C. glutamicum or E. coli. These strains carry mutations that prevent the reuptake of aromatic amino acids or multiple/overexpressed trp operons. The conversion is catalyzed by the enzyme tryptophan synthase. == Society and culture == === Showa Denko contamination scandal === There was a large outbreak of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome (EMS) in the U.S. in 1989, with more than 1,500 cases reported to the CDC and at least 37 deaths. After preliminary investigation revealed that the outbreak was linked to intake of tryptophan, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recalled tryptophan supplements in 1989 and banned most public sales in 1990, with other countries following suit. Subsequent studies suggested that EMS was linked to specific batches of L-tryptophan supplied by a single large Japanese manufacturer, Showa Denko. It eventually became clear that recent batches of Showa Denko's L-tryptophan were contaminated by trace impurities, which were subsequently thought to be responsible for the 1989 EMS outbreak. However, other evidence suggests that tryptophan itself may be a potentially major contributory factor in EMS. There are also claims that a precursor reached sufficient concentrations to form a toxic dimer. The FDA loosened its restrictions on sales and marketing of tryptophan in February 2001, but continued to limit the importation of tryptophan not intended for an exempted use until 2005. The fact that the Showa Denko facility used genetically engineered bacteria to produce the contaminated batches of L-tryptophan later found to have caused the outbreak of eosinophilia-myalgia syndrome has been cited as evidence of a need for \"close monitoring of the chemical purity of biotechnology-derived products\". Those calling for purity monitoring have, in turn, been criticized as anti-GMO activists who overlook possible non-GMO causes of contamination and threaten the development of biotech. === Turkey meat and drowsiness hypothesis === A common assertion in the US and the UK is that heavy consumption of turkey meat—as seen during Thanksgiving and Christmas—results in drowsiness, due to high levels of tryptophan contained in turkey. However, the amount of tryptophan in turkey is comparable with that of other meats. Drowsiness after eating may be caused by other foods eaten with the turkey, particularly carbohydrates. Ingestion of a meal rich in carbohydrates triggers the release of insulin. Insulin in turn stimulates the uptake of large neutral branched-chain amino acids (BCAA), but not tryptophan, into muscle, increasing the ratio of tryptophan to BCAA in the blood stream. The resulting increased tryptophan ratio reduces competition at the large neutral amino acid transporter (which transports both BCAA and aromatic amino acids), resulting in more uptake of tryptophan across the blood–brain barrier into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Once in the CSF, tryptophan is converted into serotonin in the raphe nuclei by the normal enzymatic pathway. The resultant serotonin is further metabolised into the hormone melatonin—which is an important mediator of the circadian rhythm—by the pineal gland. Hence, these data suggest that \"feast-induced drowsiness\"—or postprandial somnolence—may be the result of a heavy meal rich in carbohydrates, which indirectly increases the production of melatonin in the brain, and thereby promotes sleep. == Research == === Yeast amino acid metabolism === In 1912 Felix Ehrlich demonstrated that yeast metabolizes the natural amino acids essentially by splitting off carbon dioxide and replacing the amino group with a hydroxyl group. By this reaction, tryptophan gives rise to tryptophol. === Serotonin precursor === Tryptophan affects brain serotonin synthesis when given orally in a purified form and is used to modify serotonin levels for research. Low brain serotonin level is induced by administration of tryptophan-poor protein in a technique called acute tryptophan depletion. Studies using this method have evaluated the effect of serotonin on mood and social behavior, finding that serotonin reduces aggression and increases agreeableness. === Psychedelic effects === Tryptophan produces the head-twitch response (HTR) in rodents when administered at sufficiently high doses. The HTR is induced by serotonergic psychedelics like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin and is a behavioral proxy of psychedelic effects. Tryptophan is converted into the trace amine tryptamine and tryptamine is N-methylated by indolethylamine N-methyltransferase (INMT) into N-methyltryptamine (NMT) and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (N,N-DMT), which are known serotonergic psychedelics. === Fluorescence === Tryptophan is an important intrinsic fluorescent probe (amino acid), which can be used to estimate the nature of the microenvironment around the tryptophan residue. Most of the intrinsic fluorescence emissions of a folded protein are due to excitation of tryptophan residues. == See also == 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP) α-Methyltryptophan Acree–Rosenheim reaction Adamkiewicz reaction Attenuator (genetics) N,N-Dimethyltryptamine Hopkins–Cole reaction Serotonin Tryptamine == References == == Further reading == == External links ==",

         "Phenylalanine (symbol Phe or F) is an essential α-amino acid with the formula C9H11NO2. It can be viewed as a benzyl group substituted for the methyl group of alanine, or a phenyl group in place of a terminal hydrogen of alanine. This essential amino acid is classified as neutral, and nonpolar because of the inert and hydrophobic nature of the benzyl side chain. The L-isomer is used to biochemically form proteins coded for by DNA. Phenylalanine is a precursor for tyrosine, the monoamine neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline), and the biological pigment melanin. It is encoded by the messenger RNA codons UUU and UUC. Phenylalanine is found naturally in the milk of mammals. It is used in the manufacture of food and drink products and sold as a nutritional supplement as it is a direct precursor to the neuromodulator phenethylamine. As an essential amino acid, phenylalanine is not synthesized de novo in humans and other animals, who must ingest phenylalanine or phenylalanine-containing proteins. The one-letter symbol F was assigned to phenylalanine for its phonetic similarity. == History == The first description of phenylalanine was made in 1879, when Schulze and Barbieri identified a compound with the empirical formula, C9H11NO2, in yellow lupine (Lupinus luteus) seedlings. In 1882, Erlenmeyer and Lipp first synthesized phenylalanine from phenylacetaldehyde, hydrogen cyanide, and ammonia. The genetic codon for phenylalanine was first discovered by J. Heinrich Matthaei and Marshall W. Nirenberg in 1961. They showed that by using mRNA to insert multiple uracil repeats into the genome of the bacterium E. coli, they could cause the bacterium to produce a polypeptide consisting solely of repeated phenylalanine amino acids. This discovery helped to establish the nature of the coding relationship that links information stored in genomic nucleic acid with protein expression in the living cell. == Dietary sources == Good sources of phenylalanine are eggs, chicken, liver, beef, milk, and soybeans. Another common source of phenylalanine is anything sweetened with the artificial sweetener aspartame, such as diet drinks, diet foods and medication; the metabolism of aspartame produces phenylalanine as one of the compound's metabolites. == Dietary recommendations == The Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the U.S. Institute of Medicine set Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for essential amino acids in 2002. For phenylalanine plus tyrosine, for adults 19 years and older, 33 mg/kg body weight/day. In 2005 the DRI is set to 27 mg/kg per day (with no tyrosine), the FAO/WHO/UNU recommendation of 2007 is 25 mg/kg per day (with no tyrosine). == Other biological roles == L-Phenylalanine is biologically converted into L-tyrosine, another one of the DNA-encoded amino acids. L-tyrosine in turn is converted into L-DOPA, which is further converted into dopamine, norepinephrine (noradrenaline), and epinephrine (adrenaline). The latter three are known as the catecholamines. Phenylalanine uses the same active transport channel as tryptophan to cross the blood–brain barrier. In excessive quantities, supplementation can interfere with the production of serotonin and other aromatic amino acids as well as nitric oxide due to the overuse (eventually, limited availability) of the associated cofactors, iron or tetrahydrobiopterin. The corresponding enzymes for those compounds are the aromatic amino acid hydroxylase family and nitric oxide synthase. === In plants === Phenylalanine is the starting compound used in the synthesis of flavonoids. Lignan is derived from phenylalanine and from tyrosine. Phenylalanine is converted to cinnamic acid by the enzyme phenylalanine ammonia-lyase. == Biosynthesis == Phenylalanine is biosynthesized via the shikimate pathway. == Phenylketonuria == The genetic disorder phenylketonuria (PKU) is the inability to metabolize phenylalanine because of a lack of the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. Individuals with this disorder are known as \"phenylketonurics\" and must regulate their intake of phenylalanine. Phenylketonurics often use blood tests to monitor the amount of phenylalanine in their blood. Lab results may report phenylalanine levels using either mg/dL and μmol/L. One mg/dL of phenylalanine is approximately equivalent to 60 μmol/L. A (rare) \"variant form\" of phenylketonuria called hyperphenylalaninemia is caused by the inability to synthesize a cofactor called tetrahydrobiopterin, which can be supplemented. Pregnant women with hyperphenylalaninemia may show similar symptoms of the disorder (high levels of phenylalanine in blood), but these indicators will usually disappear at the end of gestation. Pregnant women with PKU must control their blood phenylalanine levels even if the fetus is heterozygous for the defective gene because the fetus could be adversely affected due to hepatic immaturity. A non-food source of phenylalanine is the artificial sweetener aspartame. This compound is metabolized by the body into several chemical byproducts including phenylalanine. The breakdown problems phenylketonurics have with the buildup of phenylalanine in the body also occurs with the ingestion of aspartame, although to a lesser degree. Accordingly, all products in Australia, the U.S. and Canada that contain aspartame must be labeled: \"Phenylketonurics: Contains phenylalanine.\" In the UK, foods containing aspartame must carry ingredient panels that refer to the presence of \"aspartame or E951\" and they must be labeled with a warning \"Contains a source of phenylalanine.\" In Brazil, the label \"Contém Fenilalanina\" (Portuguese for \"Contains Phenylalanine\") is also mandatory in products which contain it. These warnings are placed to help individuals avoid such foods. == D-, L- and DL-phenylalanine == The stereoisomer D-phenylalanine (DPA) can be produced by conventional organic synthesis, either as a single enantiomer or as a component of the racemic mixture. It does not participate in protein biosynthesis although it is found in proteins in small amounts - particularly aged proteins and food proteins that have been processed. The biological functions of D-amino acids remain unclear, although D-phenylalanine has pharmacological activity at niacin receptor 2. DL-Phenylalanine (DLPA) is marketed as a nutritional supplement for its purported analgesic and antidepressant activities, which have been supported by clinical trials. DL-Phenylalanine is a mixture of D-phenylalanine and L-phenylalanine. The reputed analgesic activity of DL-phenylalanine may be explained by the possible blockage by D-phenylalanine of enkephalin degradation by the enzyme carboxypeptidase A. Enkephalins act as agonists of the mu and delta opioid receptors, and agonists of these receptors are known to produce antidepressant effects. The mechanism of DL-phenylalanine's supposed antidepressant activity may also be accounted for in part by the precursor role of L-phenylalanine in the synthesis of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine, though clinical trials have not found an antidepressant effect from L-phenylalanine alone. Elevated brain levels of norepinephrine and dopamine are thought to have an antidepressant effect. D-Phenylalanine is absorbed from the small intestine and transported to the liver via the portal circulation. A small amount of D-phenylalanine appears to be converted to L-phenylalanine. D-Phenylalanine is distributed to the various tissues of the body via the systemic circulation. It appears to cross the blood–brain barrier less efficiently than L-phenylalanine, and so a small amount of an ingested dose of D-phenylalanine is excreted in the urine without penetrating the central nervous system. L-Phenylalanine is an antagonist at α2δ Ca2+ calcium channels with a Ki of 980 nM. In the brain, L-phenylalanine is a competitive antagonist at the glycine binding site of NMDA receptor and at the glutamate binding site of AMPA receptor. At the glycine binding site of NMDA receptor L-phenylalanine has an apparent equilibrium dissociation constant (KB) of 573 μM estimated by Schild regression which is considerably lower than brain L-phenylalanine concentration observed in untreated human phenylketonuria. L-Phenylalanine also inhibits neurotransmitter release at glutamatergic synapses in hippocampus and cortex with IC50 of 980 μM, a brain concentration seen in classical phenylketonuria, whereas D-phenylalanine has a significantly smaller effect. == Commercial synthesis == L-Phenylalanine is produced for medical, feed, and nutritional applications, such as aspartame, in large quantities by utilizing the bacterium Escherichia coli, which naturally produces aromatic amino acids like phenylalanine. The quantity of L-phenylalanine produced commercially has been increased by genetically engineering E. coli, such as by altering the regulatory promoters or amplifying the number of genes controlling enzymes responsible for the synthesis of the amino acid. == Derivatives == Boronophenylalanine (BPA) is a dihydroxyboryl derivative of phenylalanine, used in neutron capture therapy. 4-Azido-L-phenylalanine is a protein-incorporated unnatural amino acid used as a tool for bioconjugation in the field of chemical biology. == See also == Phenylalaninol == References == == External links == Phenylalanine mass spectrum Phenylalanine at ChemSynthesis",

         "L-Tyrosine or tyrosine (symbol Tyr or Y) or 4-hydroxyphenylalanine is one of the 20 standard amino acids that are used by cells to synthesize proteins. It is a conditionally essential amino acid with a polar side group. The word \"tyrosine\" is from the Greek tyrós, meaning cheese, as it was first discovered in 1846 by German chemist Justus von Liebig in the protein casein from cheese. It is called tyrosyl when referred to as a functional group or side chain. While tyrosine is generally classified as a hydrophobic amino acid, it is more hydrophilic than phenylalanine. It is encoded by the codons UAC and UAU in messenger RNA. The one-letter symbol Y was assigned to tyrosine for being alphabetically nearest of those letters available. Note that T was assigned to the structurally simpler threonine, U was avoided for its similarity with V for valine, W was assigned to tryptophan, while X was reserved for undetermined or atypical amino acids. The mnemonic tYrosine was also proposed. == Functions == Aside from being a proteinogenic amino acid, tyrosine has a special role by virtue of the phenol functionality. Its hydroxy group is able to form the ester linkage, with phosphate in particular. Phosphate groups are transferred to tyrosine residues by way of protein kinases. This is one of the post-translational modifications. Phosphorylated tyrosine occurs in proteins that are part of signal transduction processes. Similar functionality is also presented in serine and threonine, whose side chains have a hydroxy group, but are alcohols. Phosphorylation of these three amino acids' moieties (including tyrosine) creates a negative charge on their ends, that is greater than the negative charge of the only negatively charged aspartic and glutamic acids. Phosphorylated proteins keep these same properties—which are useful for more reliable protein-protein interactions—by means of phosphotyrosine, phosphoserine and phosphothreonine. Binding sites for a signalling phosphoprotein may be diverse in their chemical structure. Phosphorylation of the hydroxyl group can change the activity of the target protein, or may form part of a signaling cascade via SH2 domain binding. A tyrosine residue also plays an important role in photosynthesis. In chloroplasts (photosystem II), it acts as an electron donor in the reduction of oxidized chlorophyll. In this process, it loses the hydrogen atom of its phenolic OH-group. This radical is subsequently reduced in the photosystem II by the four core manganese clusters. == Dietary requirements and sources == The Dietary Reference Intake for tyrosine is usually estimated together with phenylalanine. It varies depending on an estimate method, however the ideal proportion of these two amino acids is considered to be 60:40 (phenylalanine:tyrosine) as a human body has such composition. Tyrosine, which can also be synthesized in the body from phenylalanine, is found in many high-protein food products such as meat, fish, cheese, cottage cheese, milk, yogurt, peanuts, almonds, pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, soy protein and lima beans. For example, the white of an egg has about 250 mg per egg, while beef, lamb, pork, tuna, salmon, chicken, and turkey contain about 500–1000 mg per 3 ounces (85 g) portion. == Biosynthesis == In plants and most microorganisms, tyrosine is produced via prephenate, an intermediate on the shikimate pathway. Prephenate is oxidatively decarboxylated with retention of the hydroxyl group to give p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate, which is transaminated using glutamate as the nitrogen source to give tyrosine and α-ketoglutarate. Mammals synthesize tyrosine from the essential amino acid phenylalanine (Phe), which is derived from food. The conversion of Phe to Tyr is catalyzed by the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase, a monooxygenase. This enzyme catalyzes the reaction causing the addition of a hydroxyl group to the end of the 6-carbon aromatic ring of phenylalanine, such that it becomes tyrosine. == Metabolism == === Phosphorylation and sulfation === Some of the tyrosine residues can be tagged (at the hydroxyl group) with a phosphate group (phosphorylated) by protein kinases. In its phosphorylated form, tyrosine is called phosphotyrosine. Tyrosine phosphorylation is considered to be one of the key steps in signal transduction and regulation of enzymatic activity. Phosphotyrosine can be detected through specific antibodies. Tyrosine residues may also be modified by the addition of a sulfate group, a process known as tyrosine sulfation. Tyrosine sulfation is catalyzed by tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST). Like the phosphotyrosine antibodies mentioned above, antibodies have recently been described that specifically detect sulfotyrosine. === Precursor to neurotransmitters and hormones === In dopaminergic cells in the brain, tyrosine is converted to L-DOPA by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). TH is the rate-limiting enzyme involved in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Dopamine can then be converted into other catecholamines, such as norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline). The thyroid hormones triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4) in the colloid of the thyroid are also derived from tyrosine. === Precursor to other compounds === The latex of Papaver somniferum, the opium poppy, has been shown to convert tyrosine into the alkaloid morphine and the bio-synthetic pathway has been established from tyrosine to morphine by using Carbon-14 radio-labelled tyrosine to trace the in-vivo synthetic route.Tyrosine ammonia lyase (TAL) is an enzyme in the natural phenols biosynthesis pathway. It transforms L-tyrosine into p-coumaric acid. Tyrosine is also the precursor to the pigment melanin. Tyrosine (or its precursor phenylalanine) is needed to synthesize the benzoquinone structure which forms part of coenzyme Q10. === Degradation === The decomposition of L-tyrosine (syn. para-hydroxyphenylalanine) begins with an α-ketoglutarate dependent transamination through the tyrosine transaminase to para-hydroxyphenylpyruvate. The positional description para, abbreviated p, mean that the hydroxyl group and side chain on the phenyl ring are across from each other (see the illustration below). The next oxidation step catalyzes by p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase and splitting off CO2 homogentisate (2,5-dihydroxyphenyl-1-acetate). In order to split the aromatic ring of homogentisate, a further dioxygenase, homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase is required. Thereby, through the incorporation of a further O2 molecule, maleylacetoacetate is created. Fumarylacetoacetate is created by maleylacetoacetate cis-trans-isomerase through rotation of the carboxyl group created from the hydroxyl group via oxidation. This cis-trans-isomerase contains glutathione as a coenzyme. Fumarylacetoacetate is finally split by the enzyme fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase through the addition of a water molecule. Thereby fumarate (also a metabolite of the citric acid cycle) and acetoacetate (3-ketobutyroate) are liberated. Acetoacetate is a ketone body, which is activated with succinyl-CoA, and thereafter it can be converted into acetyl-CoA, which in turn can be oxidized by the citric acid cycle or be used for fatty acid synthesis. Phloretic acid is also a urinary metabolite of tyrosine in rats. == Ortho- and meta-tyrosine == Three structural isomers of L-tyrosine are known. In addition to the common amino acid L-tyrosine, which is the para isomer (para-tyr, p-tyr or 4-hydroxyphenylalanine), there are two additional regioisomers, namely meta-tyrosine (also known as 3-hydroxyphenylalanine, L-m-tyrosine, and m-tyr) and ortho-tyrosine (o-tyr or 2-hydroxyphenylalanine), that occur in nature. The m-tyr and o-tyr isomers, which are rare, arise through non-enzymatic free-radical hydroxylation of phenylalanine under conditions of oxidative stress. == Medical use == Tyrosine is a precursor to neurotransmitters and increases plasma neurotransmitter levels (particularly dopamine and norepinephrine), but has little if any effect on mood in normal subjects. A 2015 systematic review found that \"tyrosine loading acutely counteracts decrements in working memory and information processing that are induced by demanding situational conditions such as extreme weather or cognitive load\" and therefore \"tyrosine may benefit healthy individuals exposed to demanding situational conditions\". == Industrial synthesis == L-Tyrosine is used in pharmaceuticals, dietary supplements, and food additives. Two methods were formerly used to manufacture L-tyrosine. The first involves the extraction of the desired amino acid from protein hydrolysates using a chemical approach. The second utilizes enzymatic synthesis from phenolics, pyruvate, and ammonia through the use of tyrosine phenol-lyase. Advances in genetic engineering and the advent of industrial fermentation have shifted the synthesis of L-tyrosine to the use of engineered strains of E. coli. == See also == Albinism Alkaptonuria Betalain Iodinated tyrosine derivatives Pauly reaction Tyramine Tyrosine sulfation Tyrosinemia == References == == External links == Tyrosine MS Spectrum Tyrosine metabolism Archived 2019-07-26 at the Wayback Machine Phenylalanine and tyrosine biosynthesis Phenylalanine, Tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis Archived 2021-05-06 at the Wayback Machine",
